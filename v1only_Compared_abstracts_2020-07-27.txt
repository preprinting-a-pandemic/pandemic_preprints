Setting: 
The 
observational 
analysis 
and 
individual 
level 
MR 
were 
conducted 
using 
the 
UK 
Biobank, 
a 
cohort 
study 
that 
recruited 
from 
study 
centres 
across 
the 
UK 
between 
2006 
and 
2010. 
Summary 
level 
MR 
analyses 
used 
summary 
data 
from 
previously 
published 
genome-wide 
association 
studies 
conducted 
in 
individuals 
of 
European 
ancestry. 
Participants: 
337,053 
individuals 
from 
the 
UK 
Biobank 
aged 
from 
39 
to 
70 
years 
at 
recruitment 
(mean 
= 
56.91 
years, 
SD 
= 
7.99 
years) 
and 
54% 
of 
the 
sample 
were 
female. 
Exposures: 
Smoking 
initiation, 
smoking 
heaviness, 
smoking 
cessation 
and 
lifetime 
smoking. 
Main 
Outcome(s) 
and 
Measure(s): 
Suicidal 
ideation 
and 
suicide 
attempts.

strong 
evidence 
for 
a 
causal 
effect 
of 
smoking 
behaviour 
on 
suicidal 
behaviour. 
Our 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
further 
research 
is 
needed 
into 
alternative 
risk 
factors 
for 
suicide 
which 
might 
make 
better 
intervention 
targets.

.ConclusionsMachine 
learning-based 
risk 
scores 
outperformed 
a 
widely-used 
rule-based 
triage 
algorithm 
and 
human 
prioritization 
decisions 
in 
predicting 
hospital 
outcomes. 
Performance 
was 
robust 
in 
a 
prospectively 
gathered 
dataset, 
and 
scores 
demonstrated 
adequate 
calibration. 
Future 
research 
should 
explore 
the 
robustness 
of 
these 
methods 
when 
applied 
to 
other 
settings, 
establish 
appropriate 
outcome 



measures 
for 
use 
in 
determining 
the 
need 
for 
prehospital 
care, 
and 
investigate 
the 
clinical 
impact 
of 
interventions 
based 
on 
these 
methods."

The 
main 
detrimental 
side 
effect 
of 
GC 
therapy 
is 
significant 
bone 
loss, 
resulting 
in 
glucocorticoidinduced 
osteoporosis 
(GIOP).

experienced 
by 
patients 
with 
T2DM 
are 
skeletal

changes

As 
a 
result, 
patients 
with 
T2DM 
are 
at 
risk 
for 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
fragility 
fractures.

the 
utility

transcriptome 
data 
for 
LCL, 
blood,

were 
assessed 
for 
neurodevelopmental 
Mendelian

Detection 
of 
abnormal 
splicing

pathogenic 
variants 
in 
these 
genes 
was 
performed 
with 
a 
novel

Conclusions: 
In 
this 
study, 
a 
molecular 
classification 
of 
anal 
squamous 
cell 
carcinoma 
using 
high-
throughput 
proteomics 
and 
whole-exome 
sequencing 
data 
was 
proposed. 
Moreover, 
differences 
between 
the 
two 
established 
groups 
suggested 
some 
possible 
therapies.

ConclusionsIn 
this 
setting 
of 
high 
child 
malnutrition, 
stunting 
is 
not 
independently 
associated 
with 
developmental 
risk. 
A 
low 
proportion 
of 
children 
receive 
developmentally 
supportive 
stimulation 
from 
adults, 
but 
non-parent 
adults 
provide

adult

seems 
very 
relevant 
to 
child 
development

this

Further 
research 
in 
the

longitudinal 
study 
may 
help 
to 
clarify 
direction 
of 
association. 
Interventions 
targeting 
adolescent 
girls 
before 
they 
become 
parents 
may 
be 
of 
particular 
utility 
in 
this 
setting.

"Background: 
In 
England, 
national 
safety 
guidance 
recommends 
that 
ciclosporin, 
tacrolimus 
and 
diltiazem 
are 
prescribed 
by 
brand 
name 
due 
to 
their 
narrow 
therapeutic 
windows 
and, 
in 
the 
case 
of 
tacrolimus, 
to 
reduce 
the 
chance 
of 
organ 
transplantation 
rejection. 
Various 
small 
studies 
have 
shown 



that 
changes 
to 
electronic 
health 
records 
(EHR) 
interface 
can 
affect 
prescribing 
choices.

is 
a 
major 
emerging 
zoonotic 
infectious 
disease. 
Since 
its 
first 
outbreak 
in 
2012, 
the 
virus 
has 
repeatedly 
transmitted 
from 
camels 
to 
humans 
with 
2,468 
confirmed 
cases, 
causing 
851 
deaths. 
To 
date, 
there 
are 
no 
efficacious 
drugs

vaccines 
against 
MERS-CoV, 
increasing 
its 
potential

For 
host 
and 
parasite 
communities 
in 
the 
Southern 
Ocean, 
investigations 
of 
many 
major 
groups 
of 
parasites 
have 
largely 
been 
limited 
to 
taxonomic 
and 
phylogenetic 
studies, 
creating 
an 
urgent 
need 
for 
the 
collection 
of 
baseline 
ecological 
data 
if 
we 
are 
to 
detect 
changes 
in 
host-parasite 
interactions 
in 
the 
future.

ImportanceNo 
antivirals 
are 
approved 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
bunyavirus 
infection. 
The 
ability 
to 
rapidly 
screen 
compounds 
and 
identify 
novel 
antivirals 
is 
one 
means 
to 
accelerate 
drug 
discovery 
for 
viruses 
with 
no 
approved 
treatments. 
We 
used 
this 
approach 
to 
screen 
hundreds 
of 
compounds 
against 
La 
Crosse 
virus, 
an 
emerging 
bunyavirus 
that 
causes 
significant 
disease, 
including 
encephalitis. 
We 
identified 
several 
known 
and 
previously 
unidentified 
antivirals. 
We 
focused 
on 
a 
potassium 
ionophore, 
valinomycin, 
due 
to 
its 
promising 
in 
vitro 
antiviral 
activity. 
We 
demonstrate 
that 
valinomycin, 
as 
well 
as 



a 
selection 
of 
other 
ionophores, 
exhibits 
activity 
against 
La 
Crosse 
virus 
as 
well 
as 
several 
other 
distantly 
related 
bunyaviruses. 
We 
finally 
observe 
that 
valinomycin 
has 
activity 
against 
a 
wide 
array 
of 
human 
viral 
pathogens, 
suggesting 
that 
disrupting 
potassium 
ion 
homeostasis 
with 
valinomycin 
may 
be 
a 
potent 
host 
pathway 
to 
target 
to 
quell 
virus 
infection."

Similarly, 
there 
was 
no 
observable

between

(HR,

Our 
results 
show 
that 
STK11-KEAP1 
mutations 
are 
prognostic, 
not 
predictive, 
biomarkers 
for 
anti-PD1/

To 
estimate 
the 
early 
dynamics 
of 
transmission 
in 
Wuhan, 
we 
fitted 
a 
stochastic 
transmission 
dynamic 
model 
to 
multiple 
publicly 
available 
datasets 
on 
cases 
in 
Wuhan 
and 
internationally 
exported 
cases 
from 
Wuhan. 
The 
four 
datasets 
we 
fitted 
to 
were: 
daily 
number 
of 
new 
internationally 
exported 
cases 
(or 
lack 



thereof), 
by 
date 
of 
onset, 
as 
of 
Jan 
26, 
2020; 
daily 
number 
of 
new 
cases 
in 
Wuhan 
with 
no 
market 
exposure, 
by 
date 
of 
onset, 
between 
Dec 
1, 
2019, 
and 
Jan 
1, 
2020; 
daily 
number 
of 
new 
cases 
in 
China, 
by 
date 
of 
onset, 
between 
Dec 
29, 
2019, 
and 
Jan 
23, 
2020; 
and 
proportion 
of 
infected

used 
an 
additional 
two 
datasets

outputs:

number

exported 
cases

Wuhan 
(or 
lack

in 
countries

high

by 
date

than 
non-severe 
cases 
(23.87% 
vs. 
5.20%, 
P<0.001). 
Lymphopenia 
was 
observed 
in 
82.1% 
of 
patients. 
55 
patients 
(5.00%) 
were 
admitted 
to 
intensive 
care 
unit 
and 
15 
(1.36%) 
succumbed. 
Severe 
pneumonia 
was 
independently 
associated 
with 
either 
the 
admission 
to 
intensive 
care 
unit, 
mechanical 
ventilation, 
or 
death 
in 
multivariate 
competing-risk 
model 
(sub-distribution 
hazards 
ratio, 
9.80; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
4.06 
to 
23.67). 
Conclusions: 
The 
2019-nCoV 
epidemic 
spreads 
rapidly 
by 
human-to-human 
transmission. 
Normal 
radiologic 
findings 
are 
present 
among 
some 
patients 
with 
2019-nCoV 
infection. 
The 
disease 
severity 
(including 
oxygen 
saturation, 
respiratory 
rate, 
blood 
leukocyte/lymphocyte 
count 
and 
chest 
X-ray/CT 
manifestations) 
predict 
poor 
clinical 
outcomes.

Findings 
Supplies 
of 
facemasks 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
China 
would 
have 
been 
sufficient 
for 
both 
the 
healthcare 
workers 
and 
the 
general 
population 
if 
the 
NCP 
outbreak 
only 
occurred 
in 
Hubei 
province. 
However, 
if 
the 
outbreak 
occurred 
in 
both 
Hubei 
and 
Guangdong 
provinces, 
facemask 
supplies 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
China 
could 
last 
for 
34 
days 
if 
no 
alternative 
public 
health 
intervention 
was 
introduced. 
There 
would 
be 
a 
shortage 
of 
480 
million 
facemasks 
by 
mid-February 
2020. 
If 
the 
outbreak 
occurred 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
China, 
facemask 
supplies 
could 
only 
last 
for 
16 
days 
and 
the 
shortage 
would 
considerably 
worsen, 
with 
a 
shortage 
of 
11.5 
billion 
facemasks 
by 
mid-February 
2020. 
Interpretation 
In 
light 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus 
outbreak 
in 
China, 
insufficient 
medical 
resources 
(e.g., 
shortage 
of 
facemasks) 
can 
considerably 
compromise 
the 
efficacy 
of 
public 
health 
measures. 
An 
effective 
public 
health 
intervention 
should 
also 
consider 
the 
adequacy 
and 
affordability 
of 
existing 
medical 
resources. 
Global 
collaboration 
should 
be 
strengthened 
to 
prevent 
the 
development 
of 
a 
global 
pandemic 
from 
a 
regional 
epidemic 
via 
easing 
the 
medical 
resources 
crisis 
in 
the 
affected 
countries.

and 
General 
Administration 
of 
Customs 
(GAC) 
of 
the 
People's 
Republic 
of 
China. 
Three 
scenarios 
with 
respect 
to 
wearing 
facemasks 
were 
considered: 
(1) 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
implementation 
in 
all 
regions 
of 
mainland 
China; 
(2) 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
implementation 
only 
in 
the 
epicentre 
(Hubei 
province, 
China); 
and 
(3) 
no 
implementation 
of 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy.FindingsRegardless 
of 
different 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
scenarios, 
facemask 
shortage 
would 
occur 
but 
eventually 
end 
during 
our 
prediction 
period 
(from 
20 
Jan 
2020 
to 
30 
Jun 
2020). 
The 
duration 
of 
the 
facemask 
shortage 
described 
in 
the 
scenarios 
of 
a 
country-wide 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy, 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
in 
the 
epicentre, 
and 
no 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
were 
132, 
seven, 
and 
four 
days, 
respectively. 
During 
the 
prediction 
period, 
the 
largest 
daily 
facemask 
shortages 
were 
predicted 
to 
be 
589∙5, 
49∙3, 
and 
37∙5 
million 
in 
each 
of 
the 
three 
scenarios, 
respectively. 
In 
any 
scenario, 
an 
N95 
mask 
shortage 
was 
predicted 
to 
occur 
on 
24 
January 
2020 
with 
a 
daily 
facemask 
shortage 
of 
2∙2 
million.InterpretationImplementing 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
China 
could 
lead 
to 
severe 
facemask 
shortage. 
Without 
effective 
public 
communication, 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
could 
result 
in 
societal 
panic 
and 
subsequently, 
increase 
the 
nationwide 
and 
worldwide 
demand 
for 
facemasks. 
These 
increased 
demands 
could 
cause 
a 
facemask 
shortage 
for 
healthcare 
workers 
and 
reduce 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
outbreak 
control 
in 
the 
affected 
regions, 
eventually 
leading 
to 
a 
pandemic. 
To 
fight 
novel 
infectious 
disease 
outbreaks, 
such 
as 
COVID-19, 
governments 
should 
monitor 
domestic 
facemask 
supplies 
and 
give 
priority 
to 
healthcare 
workers. 
The 
risk 
of 
asymptomatic 
transmission 
and 
facemask 
shortages 
should 
be 
carefully 
evaluated 
before 
introducing 
a 
universal 
facemask 
wearing 
policy 
in 
high-risk 
regions. 
Public 
health 
measures 
aimed 
at 
improving 
hand 
hygiene 
and 
effective 
public 
communication 
should 
be 
considered 
along 
with 
the 
facemask 
policy."

mainly 
because 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
actual 
cumulative 
numbers 
of 
infected 
and 
recovered 
cases 
in 
the 
population 
most 
likely 
are 
much 
higher 
than 
the 
reported 
ones. 
Thus, 
in 
a 
scenario 
where 
we 
have 
taken 
twenty 
times 
the 
confirmed 
number 
of 
infected 
and 
forty 
times 
the 
confirmed 
number 
of 
recovered 
cases, 
the 
case 
fatality 
ratio 
is 
around 
∼0.15% 
in 
the 
total 
population. 
Importantly, 
based 
on 
this 
scenario, 
simulations 
suggest 
a 
slow 
down 
of 
the 
outbreak 
in 
Hubei 
at 
the 
end 
of 
February.

On 
5 
February 
2020, 
in 
Yokohama, 
Japan, 
a 
cruise 
ship 
hosting 
3,711 
people 
underwent 
a 
2week 
quarantine 
after 
a 
former 
passenger 
was 
found 
with 
COVID-19 
post-disembarking. 
As 
at 
20 
February, 
634 
persons 
on 
board 
tested 
positive 
for 
the 
causative 
virus. 
We 
conducted 
statistical 
modelling 
to 
derive 
the 
delay-adjusted 
asymptomatic 
proportion 
of 
infections, 
along 
with 
the 
infections’ 
timeline. 
The 
estimated 
asymptomatic 
proportion 
was 
17.9% 
(95% 
credible 
interval 
(CrI): 
15.5–20.2%). 
Most 
infections 
occurred 
before 
the 
quarantine 
start.

FINDINGS: 
Of 
148 
confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2-infected 
patients, 
49.3% 
were 
females 
and 
50.7% 
were 
males. 
The 
median 
age 
was 
50.5 
years 
(interquartile 
range,

Patients 
had 
clinical 
manifestations 
of 
fever 
(70.1%), 
cough 
(45.3%), 
expectoration 
(26.7%) 
at 
admission. 
75 
patients 
(50.7%)

IMPORTANCE 
Following 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
collective 
human 
urinary 
microbiota, 
important 
knowledge 
gaps 
remain, 
including 
the 
stability 
and 
variability 
of 
this 
microbial 
niche 
over 
time. 
Initial 
urinary 
studies 
preferentially 
utilized 
samples 
obtained 
by 
transurethral 
catheterization 
to 
minimize 
contributions 
from 
vulvovaginal 
microbes. 
However, 
catheterization 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
alter 
the 
urinary 
microbiota; 
therefore, 
voided 
specimens 
are 
preferred 
for 
longitudinal 
studies. 
In 
this 
report, 
we 
describe 
microbial 
findings 
obtained 
by 
daily 
assessment 
over 
3 
months 
in 
a 
small 
cohort 
of 
adult 
women. 
We 
found 
that, 
similarly 
to 
vaginal 
microbiotas, 
lower 
urinary 
tract 
(LUT) 
microbiotas 
are 
dynamic, 
with 
changes 
relating 
to 
several 
factors, 
particularly 
menstruation 
and 
vaginal 
intercourse. 
Our 
study 
results 
show 
that 
LUT 



microbiotas 
are 
both 
dynamic 
and 
resilient. 
They 
also 
offer 
novel 
opportunities 
to 
target 
LUT 
microbiotas 
by 
preventative 
or 
therapeutic 
means, 
through 
risk 
and/or 
protective 
factor 
modification."

Mobile 
phone 
apps 
implementing 
algorithmic 
contact 
tracing 
can 
speed 
up 
the 
process 
of 
tracing 
newly 
diagnosed 
individuals, 
spreading 
information 
instantaneously 
back 
through 
a 
past 
contact 
network 
to 
inform 
them 
that 
they 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
being 
infected, 
and 
thus 
allow 
them 
to 
take 
appropriate 
social 
distancing 
and 
testing 
measures. 
The 
aim 
of 
non-pharmaceutical 
infection 
prevention 
is 
to 
move 
a 
population 
towards 
herd 
protection, 
a 
state 
where 
a 
population 
maintains 
R0<1, 
thus 
making 
it 
impossible 
for 
a 
pathogen 
to 
cause 
an 
epidemic. 
Here, 
we 
address 
epidemiological 
issues 
that 
affect 
the 
feasibility 
of 
an 
algorithmic 
approach 
to 
instantaneous 
contact 
tracing; 
ethical 
and 
implementation 
issues 
are 
addressed 
separately. 
First 
we 
quantify 
the 
parameters 
of 
COVID-19 
in 
a 
framework 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
renewal 
equation 
formulation 
of 
epidemic 
spread. 
Second, 
we 
use 
an 
analytical 
solution 
to 
application 
of 
first-degree 
contact 
tracing 
in 
the 
renewal 
equation 
model 
to 
explore 
combinations 
of 
efficacy 
that 
can 
induce 
herd 
protection 
(R0<1). 
With 
the 
emergence 
of 
the 
novel 
viral 
pathogen 
SARS-CoV-2, 
of 
clear 
potential 
for 
a 
global 
pandemic 
with 
high 
fatality 
rates 
and 
incapacitated 
health 
systems, 
the 
question 
of 
prevention 
has 
critical 
priority. 
We 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
isolating 
symptomatic 
cases 
and 
tracing 
their 
contacts 
in 
a 
classical 
manner 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
fast 
to 
stop 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
epidemic 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
measures 
of 
social 
distancing 
that 
are 
disruptive 
to 
a 
wide 
number 
of 
people. 
We 
show 
that 
first-degree 
instantaneous 
contact 
tracing, 
informing 
users 
when 
they 
can 
move 
safely 
or 
when 
to 
seek 
medical 
help 
and 
avoid 
vulnerable 
individuals, 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
stop 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
epidemic 
if 
used 
by 
a 
sufficiently 
large 
number 
of 
people 
with 
reasonable 
fidelity.

"INTRODUCTIONCoronavirus 
disease 
2019 
(COVID-19), 
caused 
by 
severe 
acute 
respiratory 
syndrome– 
coronavirus 
2 
(SARS-CoV-2), 
has 
clear 
potential 
for 
a 
long-lasting 
global 
pandemic, 
high 
fatality 
rates, 
and 
incapacitated 
health 
systems. 
Until 
vaccines 
are 
widely 
available, 
the 
only 
available 
infection 
prevention 
approaches 
are 
case 
isolation, 
contact 
tracing 
and 
quarantine, 
physical 
distancing, 
decontamination, 
and 
hygiene 
measures. 
To 
implement 
the 
right 
measures 
at 
the 
right 
time, 
it 
is 
of 
crucial 
importance 
to 
understand 
the 
routes 
and 
timings 
of 
transmission.RATIONALEWe 
used 
key 
parameters 
of 
epidemic 
spread 
to 
estimate 
the 
contribution 
of 
different 
transmission 
routes 
with 
a 
renewal 
equation 
formulation, 
and 
analytically 
determined 
the 
speed 
and 
scale 
for 
effective 
identification 
and 
contact 
tracing 
required 
to 
stop 
the 
epidemic.RESULTSWe 
developed 
a 
mathematical 
model 
for 
infectiousness 
to 
estimate 
the 
basic 
reproductive 
number 
R0 
and 
to 
quantify 
the 
contribution 
of 
different 
transmission 
routes. 
To 
parameterize 
the 
model, 
we 
analyzed 
40 
well-characterized 
source-recipient 
pairs 
and 
estimated 
the 
distribution 
of 
generation 
times 
(time 
from 
infection 
to 
onward 
transmission). 
The 
distribution 
had 
a 
median 
of 
5.0 
days 
and 
standard 
deviation 
of 
1.9 
days. 
We 
used 
published 
parameters 
for 
the 
incubation 
time 
distribution 
(median 
5.2 
days) 
and 
the 
epidemic 
doubling 
time 
(5.0 
days) 
from 
the 
early 
epidemic 
data 
in 
China.The 
model 
estimated 
R0 
= 
2.0 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
the 
epidemic 
in 
China. 
The 
contributions 
to 
R0 
included 
46% 
from 
presymptomatic 
individuals 
(before 
showing 
symptoms), 
38% 
from 
symptomatic 
individuals, 
10% 
from 
asymptomatic 
individuals 
(who 
never 
show 
symptoms), 
and 
6% 
from 
environmentally 
mediated 
transmission 
via 
contamination. 
Results 
on 
the 
last 
two 
routes 
are 
speculative. 
According 
to 
these 
estimates, 
presymptomatic 
transmissions 
alone 
are 
almost 
sufficient 
to 
sustain 
epidemic 



growth.To 
estimate 
the 
requirements 
for 
successful 
contact 
tracing, 
we 
determined 
the 
combination 
of 
two 
key 
parameters 
needed 
to 
reduce 
R0 
to 
less 
than 
1: 
the 
proportion 
of 
cases 
who 
need 
to 
be 
isolated, 
and 
the 
proportion 
of 
their 
contacts 
who 
need 
to 
be 
quarantined. 
For 
a 
3-day 
delay 
in 
notification 
assumed 
for 
manual 
contact 
tracing, 
no 
parameter 
combination 
leads 
to 
epidemic 
control. 
Immediate 
notification 
through 
a 
contact-
tracing 
mobile 
phone 
app 
could, 
however, 
be 
sufficient 
to 
stop 
the 
epidemic 
if 
used 
by 
a 
sufficiently 
high 
proportion 
of 
the 
population.We 
propose 
an 
app, 
based 
on 
existing 
technology, 
that 
allows 
instant 
contact 
tracing. 
Proximity 
events 
between 
two 
phones 
running 
the 
app 
are 
recorded. 
Upon 
an 
individual’s 
COVID-19 
diagnosis, 
contacts 
are 
instantly, 
automatically, 
and 
anonymously 
notified 
of 
their 
risk 
and 
asked 
to 
self-isolate. 
Practical 
and 
logistical 
factors 
(e.g., 
uptake, 
coverage, 
R0 
in 
a 
given 
population) 
will 
determine 
whether 
an 
app 
is 
sufficient 
to 
control 
viral 
spread 
on 
its 
own, 
or 
whether 
additional 
measures 
to 
reduce 
R0 
(e.g., 
physical 
distancing) 
are 
required. 
The 
performance 
of 
the 
app 
in 
scenarios 
with 
higher 
values 
of 
R0 
can 
be 
explored 
at 
https://bdi-
pathogens.shinyapps.io/covid-19-transmission-routes/.CONCLUSIONGiven 
the 
infectiousness 
of 
SARS-CoV-2 
and 
the 
high 
proportion 
of 
transmissions 
from 
presymptomatic 
individuals, 
controlling 
the 
epidemic 
by 
manual 
contact 
tracing 
is 
infeasible. 
The 
use 
of 
a 
contact-tracing 
app 
that 
builds 
a 
memory 
of 
proximity 
contacts 
and 
immediately 
notifies 
contacts 
of 
positive 
cases 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
stop 
the 
epidemic 
if 
used 
by 
enough 
people, 
in 
particular 
when 
combined 
with 
other 
measures 
such 
as 
physical 
distancing. 
An 
intervention 
of 
this 
kind 
raises 
ethical 
questions 
regarding 
access, 
transparency, 
the 
protection 
and 
use 
of 
personal 
data, 
and 
the 
sharing 
of 
knowledge 
with 
other 
countries. 
Careful 
oversight 
by 
an 
inclusive 
advisory 
body 
is 
required."

.Methods: 
An 
online 
questionnaire 
was 
administered 
to 
3000 
adults 
residing 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
3000 
adults 
residing 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
who 
had 
registered 
with 
Prolific 
Academic 
to 
participate 
in 
online 
research. 
Prolific 
Academic 
established 
strata 
by 
age 
(18-27, 
28-37, 
38-47, 
48-57, 
or 
≥58 
years), 
sex 
(male 
or 
female), 
and 
ethnicity 
(white, 
black 
or 
African 
American, 
Asian 
or 
Asian 
Indian, 
mixed, 
or 
“other”), 
as 
well 
as 
all 
permutations 
of 
these 
strata. 
The 
number 
of 
participants 
who 
could 
enroll 
in 
each 
of 
these 
strata 
was 
calculated 
to 
reflect 
the 
distribution 
in 
the 
US 
and 
UK 
general 
population. 
Enrollment 
into 
the 
survey 
within 
each 
stratum 
was 
on 
a 
first-come, 
first-served 
basis. 
Participants 
completed

falciparum 
causes 
the 
most 
severe 
form 
of 
malaria 
and 
with 
emerging 
resistance 
to 
frontline 
treatments, 
there 
is 
the 
need 
to 
identify 
new 
drug 
targets 
in 
the 
parasite. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
critical 
processes 
during 
the 
asexual 
blood 
stage 
in 
the 
parasites 
lifecycle 
is 
the 
egress 
from 
old 
red 
blood 
cells 
(RBCs) 
and 
subsequent 
invasion 
of 
new 
RBCs. 
Many 
unique 
parasite 
ligands, 
receptors 
and 
enzymes 
are 
employed 
during 
egress 
and 
invasion 
that 
are 
essential 
for 
parasite 
proliferation 
and 
survival, 
therefore 
making 
these 
processes 
druggable 
targets. 
Identifying 
novel 
compounds 
that 
inhibit 
these 
essential 
processes 
would 
further 
their 
development 
into 
possible 
antimalarials 
that 
would 
be 
highly 
effective 
at 
killing 
asexual 
RBC 
stage 
parasites 
when 
used 
in 
combination 
with 
drugs 
that 
target 
the 
intraerythrocytic 
growth 
phase. 
These 
compounds 
potentially 
may 
also 
be 
used 
as 
novel 
tools 
to 
study 
the 
complex 
biology 
of 
parasites 
to 
gain 
further 
insight 
into 
the 
mechanisms 
behind 
egress 
and 
invasion.

that 
the 
collaboration 
leads 
to 
synergistic 
actin

to 
elongation. 
Further, 
Spire

.\n\nMethodsTo 
evaluate 
the 
expression 
of 
C2cd5, 
we 
first 
used 
in 
situ 
hybridization 
and 
RNAscope 
technology 
in 
combination 
with 
electronic 
microscopy. 
For 
in 
vivo, 
we 
characterized 
the 
energy 
balance 
of 
wild 
type 
(WT) 
and 
C2CD5 
whole-body 
knockout 
(C2CD5KO) 
mice 
fed 
normal 
chow 
(NC) 
and/or 
western-diet 
(high-fat/high-sucrose/cholesterol) 
(WD). 
To 
this 
end, 
we 
performed 
comprehensive 
longitudinal 
assessment 
of 
bodyweight, 
energy 
balance 
(food 
intake, 
energy 
expenditure, 
locomotor 
activity 
using 
TSE 
metabolic 
cages), 
and 
glucose 
homeostasis. 
In 
addition, 
we 
evaluated 
the 
consequence 
of 
loss 
of 
C2CD5 
on 
feeding 
behavior 
changes 
normally 
induced 
by 
MC4R 
agonist 
(Melanotan, 
MTII) 
injection 
in 
the 
paraventricular 
hypothalamus 
(PVH). 
For 
in 
vitro 
approach, 
we 
tease 
out 
the 
role 
of 
C2CD5 
and 
its 
calcium 
sensing 
domain 
C2 
in 
MC4R 
trafficking. 
We 
focused 
on 
endocytosis 
of 
MC4R 
using 
an 
antibody 
feeding 
experiment 
(in 
a 
neuronal 
cell 
line 
-Neuro2A 
(N2A) 
stably 
expressing 
HA-MC4R-GFP; 
against 
HA-tag 
and 
analyzed 
by 
flux 
cytometry).\n\nResultsWe 
found 
that 
1) 
the 
expression 
of 
hypothalamic 
C2CD5 
is 
decreased 
in 
diet-induced 
obesity 
models 
compared 
to 
controls, 
2) 
mice 
lacking 
C2CD5 
exhibit 
an 
increase 
in 
food 
intake 
compared 
to 
WT 
mice, 
3) 
C2CD5 
interacts 
with 
endocytosis 
machinery 
in 
hypothalamus, 
4) 
loss 
of 
functional 
C2CD5 
(lacking 
C2 
domain) 
blunts 
MC4R 
endocytosis 
in 
vitro 
and 
increases 
MC4R 
at 
the 
surface 
that 
fails 
to 
respond 
to 
MC4R 
ligand, 
and, 
5) 
C2CD5KO 
mice 
exhibit 
decreased 
acute 
responses 
to 
MTII 
injection 
into 
the 
PVH.\n\nConclusionsBased 
on 
these, 
we 
conclude 
that 
hypothalamic 
C2CD5 
is 
involved 
in 
MC4R 
endocytosis 
and 
regulate 
bodyweight 
homeostasis. 
These 
studies 
suggest 
that 
C2CD5 
represents 
a 
new 
protein 
regulated 
by 
metabolic 
cues 
and 
involved 
in 
metabolic 
receptor 
endocytosis. 
C2CD5 
represent 
a 
new 
target 
and 
pathway 
that 
could 
be 
targeted 
in 
Obesity.
