10.1101/013375,"The brain exhibits temporally complex patterns of activity with features similar to those of chaotic systems. Theoretical studies over the last twenty years have described various computational advantages for such regimes in neuronal systems. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether chaos requires specific cellular properties or network architectures, or whether it is a generic property of neuronal circuits. We investigate the dynamics of networks of excitatory-inhibitory (EI) spiking neurons with random sparse connectivity operating in the regime of balance of excitation and inhibition. Combining Dynamical Mean-Field Theory with numerical simulations, we show that chaotic, asynchronous firing rate fluctuations emerge generically for sufficiently strong synapses. Two different mechanisms can lead to these chaotic fluctuations. One mechanism relies on slow I-I inhibition which gives rise to slow subthreshold voltage and rate fluctuations. The decorrelation time of these fluctuations is proportional to the time constant of the inhibition. The second mechanism relies on the recurrent E-I-E feedback loop. It requires slow excitation but the inhibition can be fast. In the corresponding dynamical regime all neurons exhibit rate fluctuations on the time scale of the excitation. Another feature of this regime is that the population-averaged firing rate is substantially smaller in the excitatory population than in the inhibitory population. This is not necessarily the case in the I-I mechanism. Finally, we discuss the neurophysiological and computational significance of our results.\n\nAuthor SummaryCortical circuits exhibit complex temporal patterns of spiking and are exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations in their ongoing activity. These features are all suggestive of an underlying chaotic dynamics. Theoretical works have indicated that a rich dynamical reservoir can endow neuronal circuits with remarkable computational capabilities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying chaos in circuits of spiking neurons remain unknown. We combine analytical calculations and numerical simulations to investigate this fundamental issue. Our key result is that chaotic firing rate fluctuations on the time scales of the synaptic dynamics emerge generically from the network collective dynamics. Our results pave the way in the study of the physiological mechanisms and computational significance of chaotic states in neuronal networks."
10.1101/012930,"The widely used Translation Libration Screw (TLS) approximation describes concerted motions of atomic groups in X-ray refinement. TLS refinement often provides a better interpretation of diffraction data and the resulting rigid body motions may subsequently be assigned biochemical significance. In TLS refinement, three matrices (T, L and S) describe harmonic vibration, libration and their correlation. Because these matrices describe specific motions, they impose a number of conditions on their elements. Ignoring these conditions while refining the matrix elements may result in matrices that cannot be interpreted in terms of physically realistic motions. We describe a mathematical framework and the computational tools to analyze refined TLS matrices through their decomposition into descriptors of underlying motions. This allows for straightforward validation and identification of implausible TLS parameters. An algorithm for the generation of structural ensembles that are consistent with given TLS parameters, implemented as a part of the Phenix project, is also described.\n\nSynopsisProcedures for the decomposition of TLS matrices into elementary vibrations and librations indicates possible errors in the definition of these matrices and corrects them when possible. The program outputs the corresponding vibration-libration parameters and generates structural ensembles."
10.1101/012955,"Identifying the intramolecular motions of proteins and nucleic acids is a major challenge in macromolecular X-ray crystallography. While Bragg diffraction describes the average positional distribution of crystalline atoms, many different models can fit this distribution equally well. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reduce this degeneracy by directly reporting on correlated atomic displacements. Although recent technological advances are increasing the potential to accurately measure diffuse scattering, computational modeling and validation tools are still needed to quantify the agreement between experimental data and different parameterizations of crystalline disorder. A new tool, phenix.diffuse, addresses this need by employing Guiniers equation to calculate diffuse scattering from Protein Data Bank (PDB)-formatted structural ensembles. As an example case, phenix.diffuse is applied to Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS) refinement, which models rigid body displacement for segments of the macromolecule. To enable calculation of diffuse scattering from TLS refined structures, phenix.tls_models builds multi-model PDB files that sample the underlying T, L and S tensors. In the glycerophosphodiesterase GpdQ, alternative TLS group partitioning and different motional correlations between groups yield markedly dissimilar diffuse scattering maps with distinct implications for molecular mechanism and allostery. These methods demonstrate how X-ray diffuse scattering can extend macromolecular structural refinement, validation, and analysis.\n\nSynopsisA method of simulating X-ray diffuse scattering from multi-model PDB files is presented. Despite similar agreement with Bragg data, different Translation-Libration-Screw refinement strategies produce unique diffuse intensity patterns."
10.1101/013383,"In this paper we discuss data and methodological challenges for building bacterial communication networks using two examples: Escherichia coli as a flagellate bacterium and of Geobacter sulfurreducens as a biofilm forming bacterium. We first highlight the link between the bacterial network communication design with respect to metabolic information processing design. The potentialities of designing routing network schemes described previously in literature and based on bacteria motility and genetic message exchanges will depend on the genes coding for the intracellular and intercellular signalling pathways. In bacteria, the \""mobilome\"" is related to horizontal gene transfer. Bacteria trade off the acquisition of new genes which could improve their survival (and often their communication bandwidth), keeping their genome enough small to assure quick DNA replication and increase fast the biomass to speed up cell division. First, by using a multi-objective optimisation procedure, we search for the optimal trade off between energy production, which is a requirement for the motility, and the biomass growth, which is related to the overall survival and fitness of the bacterium. We use flux balance analysis of genome-scale biochemical network of Escherichia coli k-13 MG1655. Then, as a second case study we analyze the electric properties and biomass trade-off of the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens which constructs an electric biofilm where electrons move across the nanowires. Here we discuss the potentialities of optimisation methodologies to design and select bacterial strains with desiderata properties. The optimisation methodologies establish also a relation between metabolism, network communication and computing. Moreover, we point to genetic design and synthetic biology as key areas to develop bacterial nano communication networks."
10.1101/013425,"Since the invention of DNA sequencing in the seventies, computational biologists have had to deal with the problem de novo genome assembly with limited (or insufficient) depth of sequencing. In this work, for the first time we investigate the opposite problem, that is, the challenge of dealing with excessive depth of sequencing. Specifically, we explore the effect of ultra-deep sequencing data in two domains: (i) the problem of decoding reads to BAC clones (in the context of the combinatorial pooling design proposed in [1]), and (ii) the problem of de novo assembly of BAC clones. Using real ultra-deep sequencing data, we show that when the depth of sequencing increases over a certain threshold, sequencing errors make these two problems harder and harder (instead of easier, as one would expect with error-free data), and as a consequence the quality of the solution degrades with more and more data. For the first problem, we propose an effective solution based on \""divide and conquer\"": we \""slice\"" a large dataset into smaller samples of optimal size, decode each slice independently, then merge the results. Experimental results on over 15,000 barley BACs and over 4,000 cowpea BACs demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of the decoding and the final assembly. For the second problem, we show for the first time that modern de novo assemblers cannot take advantage of ultra-deep sequencing data."
10.1101/013367,"In recent years, there have been many calls for an extended evolutionary synthesis, based in part upon growing evidence for non-genetic mechanisms of inheritance, i.e., similarities in phenotype between parents and offspring that are not due to shared genes. While there has been an impressive marshalling of evidence for diverse forms of non-genetic inheritance (epigenetic, ecological, behavioural, symbolic), there have been relatively few studies trying to integrate the different forms of inheritance into a common conceptual structure, a development that would be important to formalizing elements of the extended evolutionary synthesis. Here, we propose a framework for an extended view of inheritance and introduce some conceptual distinctions that we believe are important to this issue. In this framework, the phenotype is conceived of as a dynamic entity, its state at any point in time resulting from intertwined effects of previous phenotypic state, and of hereditary materials (DNA and otherwise) and environment. We contrast our framework with the standard gene-based view of inheritance, and also discuss our framework in the specific context of recent attempts to accommodate non-genetic inheritance within the framework of classical quantitative genetics and the Price equation. In particular, we believe that the extended view of inheritance and effects on the phenotype developed here is particularly well-suited to individual-based simulation studies of evolutionary dynamics. The results of such simulations, in turn, could be useful for assessing how well extended models based on quantitative genetics or the Price equation perform at capturing complex evolutionary dynamics."
10.1101/013136,"Human epilepsies encompass a wide variety of clinical, behavioral and electrical manifestations. Correspondingly, studies of this disease in nonhuman animals have brought forward an equally wide array of animal models, i.e. species and acute or chronic seizure induction protocols. Epilepsy research has a long history of comparative anatomical and physiological studies on a range of mostly mammalian species. Nonetheless, a relatively limited number of rodent models emerged as the primary choices for most epilepsy-related investigations. In many cases these animal models are selected based on convenience or tradition, though technical or experimental rationale does, and should, factor into these decisions. More complex mammalian brains and, especially, genetic model organisms including zebrafish have been studied less but offer significant advantages that are being widely recognized."
10.1101/013417,"Species geographic ranges vary enormously, and even closest relatives may differ in range size by several orders of magnitude. With data from hundreds of species spanning 20 genera in 15 families, we show that plant species that autonomously reproduce via self-pollination consistently have larger geographic ranges than their close relatives that generally require two parents for reproduction. Further analyses strongly implicate autonomous self-fertilization in causing this relationship, as it is not driven by traits such as polyploidy or annual life history whose evolution is sometimes correlated with autonomous self-fertilization. Furthermore, we find that selfers occur at higher maximum latitudes and that disparity in range size between selfers and outcrossers increases with time since their separation. Together, these results show that autonomous reproduction -- a critical biological trait that eliminates mate limitation and thus potentially increases the probability of establishment -- increases range size."
10.1101/013490,"Monitoring the progress of DNA molecules through a membrane pore has been postulated as a method for sequencing DNA for several decades. Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available that we used for sequencing the S. cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr (https://github.com/jgurtowski/nanocorr) specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, as existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5-50kbp) at such high error rate (between [~]5 and 40% error). With this new method we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: the contig N50 length is more than ten-times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678kb versus 59.9kbp), and has greater than 99.88% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.\n\nReviewer link to datahttp://schatzlab.cshl.edu/data/nanocorr/"
10.1101/013482,"Introgression is the transfer of genes or genomic regions from one species into another via hybridization and back-crosses. We have introgressed four translocations (EB4, IBj5, UK14-1, and B362i) from Neurospora crassa into N. tetrasperma. This enabled us to construct heterokaryotic [T + N] and [Dp + Df] strains in which the mat-A and mat-a nuclei have different genotypes. Self-crosses of the heterokaryons again produced [T + N] and [Dp + Df] progeny. From conidia (vegetative spores) produced by the heterokaryotic mycelia we obtained self-fertile (heterokaryotic) and self-sterile (homokaryotic) derivative strains. [T + N] heterokaryons produced homokaryotic derivatives of both mating types, but [Dp + Df] heterokaryons produced viable homokaryons of only the mating type of the Dp nucleus. All the four [T + N] heterokaryons, and three [Dp + Df] heterokaryons, produced both self-sterile and self-fertile conidial derivatives, but the [Dp(B362i) + Df(B362i)] heterokaryons produced only self-sterile ones. Conceivably, the Df(B362i) nuclei may be deleted for a nucleus-limited gene required for efficient mitosis or nuclear division, and whose deficit is not complemented by the neighboring Dp(B362i) nuclei. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) was shown to occur in a Dp-heterozygous cross, therefore RIP-alteration of a translocated segment would depend on relative numbers of self-crosses undergone in [Dp + Df] versus [T + N] ancestors."
10.1101/013474,"Geographic patterns of genetic variation within modern populations, produced by complex histories of migration, can be difficult to infer and visually summarize. A general consequence of geographically limited dispersal is that samples from nearby locations tend to be more closely related than samples from distant locations, and so genetic covariance often recapitulates geographic proximity. We use genome-wide polymorphism data to build \""geogenetic maps,\"" which, when applied to stationary populations, produces a map of the geographic positions of the populations, but with distances distorted to reflect historical rates of gene flow. In the underlying model, allele frequency covariance is a decreasing function of geogenetic distance, and nonlocal gene flow such as admixture can be identified as anomalously strong covariance over long distances. This admixture is explicitly co-estimated and depicted as arrows, from the source of admixture to the recipient, on the geogenetic map. We demonstrate the utility of this method on a circum-Tibetan sampling of the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides), in which we find evidence for gene flow between the adjacent, terminal populations of the ring species. We also analyze a global sampling of human populations, for which we largely recover the geography of the sampling, with support for significant histories of admixture in many samples. This new tool for understanding and visualizing patterns of population structure is implemented in a Bayesian framework in the program SpaceMix.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this paper, we introduce a statistical method for inferring, for a set of sequenced samples, a map in which the distances between population locations reflect genetic, rather than geographic, proximity. Two populations that are sampled at distant locations but that are genetically similar (perhaps one was recently founded by a colonization event from the other) may have inferred locations that are nearby, while two populations that are sampled close together, but that are genetically dissimilar (e.g., are separated by a barrier), may have inferred locations that are farther apart. The result is a \""geogenetic\"" map in which the distances between populations are effective distances, indicative of the way that populations perceive the distances between themselves: the \""organisms-eye view\"" of the world. Added to this, \""admixture\"" can be thought of as the outcome of unusually long-distance gene flow; it results in relatedness between populations that is anomalously high given the distance that separates them. We depict the effect of admixture using arrows, from a source of admixture to its target, on the inferred map. The inferred geogenetic map is an intuitive and information-rich visual summary of patterns of population structure."
10.1101/013532,"Integrated -omics approaches are quickly spreading across microbiology research labs, leading to i) the possibility of detecting previously hidden features of microbial cells like multi-scale spatial organisation and ii) tracing molecular components across multiple cellular functional states. This promises to reduce the knowledge gap between genotype and phenotype and poses new challenges for computational microbiologists. We underline how the capability to unravel the complexity of microbial life will strongly depend on the integration of the huge and diverse amount of information that can be derived today from - omics experiments. In this work, we present opportunities and challenges of multi -omics data integration in current systems biology pipelines. We here discuss which layers of biological information are important for biotechnological and clinical purposes, with a special focus on bacterial metabolism and modelling procedures. A general review of the most recent computational tools for performing large-scale datasets integration is also presented, together with a possible framework to guide the design of systems biology experiments by microbiologists."
10.1101/013508,"The function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) depends on their location within the cell. While most studies to date have concentrated on their nuclear roles in transcriptional regulation, evidence is mounting that lncRNA also have cytoplasmic roles. Here we comprehensively map the cytoplasmic and ribosomal lncRNA population in a human cell. Three-quarters (74%) of lncRNAs are detected in the cytoplasm, the majority of which (62%) preferentially cofractionate with polyribosomes. Ribosomal lncRNA are highly expressed across tissues, under purifying evolutionary selection, and have cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios comparable to mRNAs and consistent across cell types. LncRNAs may be classified into three groups by their ribosomal interaction: non-ribosomal cytoplasmic lncRNAs, and those associated with either heavy or light polysomes. A number of mRNA-like features destin lncRNA for light polysomes, including capping and 5UTR length, but not cryptic open reading frames or polyadenylation. Surprisingly, exonic retroviral sequences antagonise recruitment. In contrast, it appears that lncRNAs are recruited to heavy polysomes through basepairing to mRNAs. Finally, we show that the translation machinery actively degrades lncRNA. We propose that light polysomal lncRNAs are translationally engaged, while heavy polysomal lncRNAs are recruited indirectly. These findings point to extensive and reciprocal regulatory interactions between lncRNA and the translation machinery."
10.1101/013516,"To study olfaction, first we should know which physical or chemical properties of odorant molecules determine the response of olfactory receptor neurons, and then we should study the effect of those properties on the combinatorial encoding in olfactory system.\n\nIn this work we show that the response of an olfactory receptor neuron in Drosophila depends on molecular volume of an odorant; The molecular volume determines the upper limits of the neural response, while the actual neural response may depend on other properties of the molecules. Each olfactory receptor prefers a particular volume, with some degree of flexibility. These two parameters predict the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket of the olfactory receptors, which are the targets of structural biology studies.\n\nAt the end we argue that the molecular volume can affects the quality of perceived smell of an odorant via the combinatorial encoding, molecular volume may mask other underlying relations between properties of molecules and neural responses and we suggest a way to improve the selection of odorants in further experimental studies."
10.1101/013573,"Distantly related clades that occupy similar environments may differ due to the lasting imprint of their ancestors - historical contingency. The New World warblers (Parulidae) and Old World warblers (Phylloscopidae) are ecologically similar clades that differ strikingly in plumage coloration. We studied genetic and functional evolution of the short-wavelength sensitive visual pigments (SWS2 and SWS1) to ask if altered color perception could contribute to the plumage color differences between clades. We show SWS2 is short-wavelength shifted in birds that occupy open environments, such as finches, compared to those in closed environments, including warblers. Sequencing of opsin genes and phylogenetic reconstructions indicate New World warblers were derived from a finch-like form that colonized from the Old World 15-20Ma. During this process the SWS2 gene accumulated 6 substitutions in branches leading to New World warblers, inviting the hypothesis that passage through a finch-like ancestor resulted in SWS2 evolution. In fact, we show spectral tuning remained similar across warblers as well as the finch ancestor. Results reject the hypothesis of historical contingency based on opsin spectral tuning, but point to evolution of other aspects of visual pigment function. Using the approach outlined here, historical contingency becomes a generally testable theory in systems where genotype and phenotype can be connected."
10.1101/013607,"Convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar traits in different species or lineages of the same species; this often is a result of adaptation to similar environments, a process referred to as convergent adaptation. We investigate here the molecular basis of convergent adaptation in maize to highland climates in Mesoamerica and South America using genome-wide SNP data. Taking advantage of archaeological data on the arrival of maize to the highlands, we infer demographic models for both populations, identifying evidence of a strong bottleneck and rapid expansion in South America. We use these models to then identify loci showing an excess of differentiation as a means of identifying putative targets of natural selection, and compare our results to expectations from recently developed theory on convergent adaptation. Consistent with predictions across a wide parameter space, we see limited evidence for convergent evolution at the nucleotide level in spite of strong similarities in overall phenotypes. Instead, we show that selection appears to have predominantly acted on standing genetic variation, and that introgression from wild teosinte populations appears to have played a role in highland adaptation in Mexican maize."
10.1101/013615,"Semantic Web technologies have been widely applied in Life Sciences, for example by data providers like OpenLifeData and Web Services frameworks like SADI. The recent OpenLifeData2SADI project offers access to the OpenLifeData data store through SADI services. This paper shows how to merge data from OpenLifeData with other extant SADI services in the Galaxy bioinformatics analysis platform, making semantic data amenable to complex analyses, as a worked example demonstrates. The whole setting is reproducible through a Docker image that includes a pre-configured Galaxy server with data and workflows that constitute the worked example."
10.1101/013623,"BackgroundDeep mutational scanning is a technique to estimate the impacts of mutations on a gene by using deep sequencing to count mutations in a library of variants before and after imposing a functional selection. The impacts of mutations must be inferred from changes in their counts after selection.\n\nResultsI describe a software package, dms_tools, to infer the impacts of mutations from deep mutational scanning data using a likelihood-based treatment of the mutation counts. I show that dms_tools yields more accurate inferences on simulated data than simply calculating ratios of counts pre-and post-selection. Using dms_tools, one can infer the preference of each site for each amino acid given a single selection pressure, or assess the extent to which these preferences change under different selection pressures. The preferences and their changes can be intuitively visualized with sequence-logo-style plots created using an extension to weblogo.\n\nConclusionsdms_tools implements a statistically principled approach for the analysis and subsequent visualization of deep mutational scanning data."
10.1101/013441,"1Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure, and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental , and demographic stochasticity, evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development."
10.1101/013649,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a key role in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover less than 2% of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified over 2,000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data."
10.1101/013664,"Putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) have long been implicated in regulation of DNA replication and transcription, though their actual roles are unknown. To gain insight into potential PQS transcriptional function, we map and analyze PQS motifs in promoters of genes differentially-expressed in Bloom Syndrome (BS) and Werner Syndrome (WS), two human genetic disorders resulting in loss of PQS-interacting RecQ helicases. Non-B-DNA structures at PQS might be stabilized in these syndromes. For BS and WS we demonstrate that PQS promoter abundance is generally higher in down-regulated genes and lower in up-regulated genes, and show that these effects are position-dependent. To interpret these correlations we determined genome-wide PQS correlations with transcription using epigenetic information to predict gene expression. We report that 33% and 35% of analyzed PQS positions in promoter antisense and sense strands, respectively, displayed statistically-significant correlation with gene expression. Of these statistically-significant positions, 100% and 84% on antisense and sense strands, respectively, were correlated with reduced expression. This suggests that promoter PQS repress transcription. Finally, we report neural network clustering analysis of PQS motifs to demonstrate that genes differentially-expressed in BS and WS are significantly biased in their PQS motifs, suggesting an unappreciated biological relationship between PQS, RecQ helicases, and transcription.\n\nREVIEWER LINKS TO DEPOSITED DATAftp://www.jsmes.net/PQS_Genomics"
10.1101/013631,"Renewable in vitro cell cultures, such as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), have facilitated studies that contributed to our understanding of genetic influence on human traits. However, the degree to which cell lines faithfully maintain differences in donor-specific phenotypes is still debated. We have previously reported that standard cell line maintenance practice results in a loss of donor-specific gene expression signatures in LCLs. An alternative to the LCL model is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system, which carries the potential to model tissue-specific physiology through the use of differentiation protocols. Still, existing LCL banks represent an important source of starting material for iPSC generation, and it is possible that the disruptions in gene regulation associated with long-term LCL maintenance could persist through the reprogramming process. To address this concern, we studied the effect of reprogramming mature LCLs to iPSCs on the ensuing gene expression patterns within and between six unrelated donor individuals. We show that the reprogramming process results in a recovery of donor-specific gene regulatory signatures. Since environmental contributions are unlikely to be a source of individual variation in our system of highly passaged cultured cell lines, our observations suggest that the effect of genotype on gene regulation is more pronounced in the iPSCs than in the LCL precursors. Our findings indicate that iPSCs can be a powerful model system for studies of phenotypic variation across individuals in general, and the genetic association with variation in gene regulation in particular. We further conclude that LCLs are an appropriate starting material for iPSC generation."
10.1101/013680,"1A capacity to predict the spread rate of populations is critical for understanding the impacts of climate change and invasive species. Despite sophisticated theory describing how populations spread, the prediction of spread rate remains a formidable challenge. As well as the inherent stochasticity in the spread process, spreading populations are subject to strong evolutionary forces (operating on dispersal and reproductive rates) that can cause accelerating spread. Despite these strong evolutionary forces, serial founder events and drift on the expanding range edge mean that evolutionary trajectories in the invasion vanguard may be highly stochastic. Here I develop a model of spatial spread in continuous space that incorporates evolution of continuous traits under a quantitative genetic model of inheritance. I use this model to investigate the potential role of evolution on the variation in spread rate between replicate model realisations. Models incorporating evolution exhibited more than four times the variance in spread rate across replicate invasions compared with nonevolving scenarios. Results suggest that the majority of this increase in variation is driven by evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front rather than initial founder events: in many cases evolutionary stochasticity on the invasion front contributed more than 90% of the variance in spread rate over 30 generations. Our uncertainty around predicted spread rates - whether for invasive species or those shifting under climate change - may be much larger than we expect when the spreading population contains heritable variation in rates of dispersal and reproduction."
10.1101/013540,"Maize offers an ideal system through which to demonstrate the potential of ancient population genomic techniques for reconstructing the evolution and spread of domesticates. The diffusion of maize from Mexico into the North American Southwest (SW) remains contentious with the available evidence being restricted to morphological studies of ancient maize plant material. We captured 1 Mb of nuclear DNA from 32 archaeological maize samples spanning 6000 years and compared them with modern landraces including those from the Mexican West coast and highlands. We found that the initial diffusion of domesticated maize into the SW is likely to have occurred through a highland route. However, by 2000 years ago a Pacific coastal corridor was also being used. Furthermore, we could distinguish between genes that were selected for early during domestication (such as zagl1 involved in shattering) from genes that changed in the SW context (e.g. related to sugar content and adaptation to drought) likely as a response to the local arid environment and new cultural uses of maize."
10.1101/013656,"Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, or distal arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A), is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in MYH3 and characterized by multiple congenital contractures of the face and limbs and normal cognitive development. We identified a subset of five simplex cases putatively diagnosed with \""DA2A with severe neurological abnormalities\"" in which the proband had Congenital Contractures of the LImbs and FAce, Hypotonia, and global Developmental Delay often resulting in early death, a unique condition that we now refer to as CLIFAHDD syndrome. Exome sequencing identified missense mutations in sodium leak channel, nonselective (NALCN) in four families with CLIFAHDD syndrome. Using molecular inversion probes to screen NALCN in a cohort of 202 DA cases as well as concurrent exome sequencing of six other DA cases revealed NALCN mutations in ten additional families with \""atypical\"" forms of DA. All fourteen mutations were missense variants predicted to alter amino acid residues in or near the S5 and S6 pore-forming segments of NALCN, highlighting the functional importance of these segments. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that mutant NALCN nearly abolished the expression of wildtype NALCN, suggesting that mutations that cause CLIFAHDD syndrome have a dominant negative effect. In contrast, homozygosity for mutations in other regions of NALCN has been reported in three families with an autosomal recessive condition characterized mainly by hypotonia and severe intellectual disability. Accordingly, mutations in NALCN can cause either a recessive or dominant condition with varied though overlapping phenotypic features perhaps depending on the type of mutation and affected protein domain(s)."
10.1101/013458,"Translational neuroscience in the field of spinal cord injuries (SCI) faces a strong disproportion between immense preclinical research efforts and a lack of therapeutic approaches successful in human patients: Currently, preclinical research on SCI yields more than 3,000 new publications per year (8,000 when including the whole central nervous system, growing at an exponential rate), whereas none of the resulting therapeutic concepts has led to functional recovery of neural tissue in humans.

Many tumor types are hierarchically organized and driven by a sub-population of cells often called cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are uniquely capable of recapitulating the tumor and can be highly resistant to radio-and chemotherapy treatment. We investigate tumor growth patterns from a theoretical standpoint and show how significant changes in pre-and post-therapy tumor dynamics are tied to the dynamics of cancer stem cells. We identify two characteristic growth regimes of a tumor population that can be leveraged to estimate cancer stem cell fractions in vivo using simple linear regression. Our method is a mathematically exact result, parameter free and does not require any microscopic knowledge of the tumor properties. A more accurate quantification of the direct link between the sub-population driving tumor growth and treatment response promises new ways to individualize treatment strategies.\n\nSignificance StatementUnder the cancer stem cell hypothesis a tumor population is driven by a fraction of self-renewing cancer stem cells. Absolute and relative size of this population in human cancers at any stage of the disease remains unknown. We formulate a mathematical model that describes the tumor cell populations growth dynamics and response to therapy. This allows to estimate cancer stem cell fraction from longitudinal measurements of tumor size (often available from imaging). Such estimates are critical because treatment outcome and risk of relapse depend on the tumors capacity to self-renew. Ideally, by tailoring patient treatment strategies based on the relative abundance of cancer stem cells could lead to radically different therapeutic regime and to the successful eradication of the disease."
10.1101/013599,"The human T cell repertoire is complex and is generated by the rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments on the T cell receptor (TCR) loci. The T cell repertoire demonstrates selfsimilarity in terms clonal frequencies when defined by V, D and J gene segment usage; therefore to determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR loci contributes to the observed clonal frequencies, the TCR loci were examined for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of gene segment organization. Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V and J gene segments for both T cell receptor  (TRA) and {beta} (TRB) loci were arranged in a selfsimilar manner when the spacing between the adjacent segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene segment, with an average fractal dimension of 1.5. The ratio of genomic distance between either the J (in TRA) or D (in TRB) segments and successive V segments on these loci declined logarithmically with a slope of similar magnitude. Accounting for the gene segments occurring on helical DNA molecules in a logarithmic distribution, sine and cosine functions of the log transformed angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene segments showed an ordered progression from the 5 to the 3 end of the locus, supporting a log-periodic organization. T cell clonal frequencies, based on V and J segment usage, from three normal stem cell donors were plotted against the V and J segment on TRB locus and demonstrated a periodic distribution. We hypothesize that this quasi-periodic variation in gene-segment representation in the T cell clonal repertoire may be influenced by the location of the gene segments on the periodic-logarithmically scaled TCR loci. Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double helix may influence the probability of gene segment usage by means of either constructive or destructive interference resulting from the superposition of the two helices."
10.1101/013714,"Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are powerful tools for genome engineering. These synthetic nucleases are assembled with programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and a non-specific FokI cleavage domain. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism is associated with cardiovascular outcomes, including ischaemic stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD). So the objective of this study is to create mutations of AopE gene by ZFNs and TALENs technology. Here, we used the Context-dependent assembly (CoDA) method to design and screen ZFNs specifically targeting with ApoE gene. The targeted cleavage capacity of these ZFNs was validated in yeast system and HEK 293T cells. Meanwhile, an efficient assembled TALENs to target ApoE gene in HEK 293T cells was as a control. The results showed that both ZFNs and TALENs worked on ApoE gene with similar high-efficiency cleavage capability. The result would provide efficient methods for genome editing, so as to get disease model for gene therapy for the further study."
10.1101/013755,"We present three linkage-disequilibrium (LD)-based recombination maps generated using whole-genome sequencing data of 10 Nigerian chimpanzees, 13 bonobos, and 15 western gorillas, collected as part of the Great Ape Genome Project (Prado-Martinez et al. 2013). Using species-specific PRDM9 sequences to predict potential binding sites, we identified an important role for PRDM9 in predicting recombination rate variation broadly across great apes. Our results are contrary to previous research that PRDM9 is not associated with recombination in western chimpanzees (Auton et al. 2012). Additionally, we show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time-scale of complete hotspot turnover. We quantified the variation in the biased distribution of recombination rates towards recombination hotspots across great apes. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10-15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected. Finally, based on multiple linear regression analysis, we found that various correlates of recombination rate persist throughout primates including repeats, diversity, divergence and local effective population size (Ne). Our study is the first to analyze within-and between-species genome-wide recombination rate variation in several close relatives."
10.1101/013722,"The P-element is one of the best understood eukaryotic transposable elements. It invaded Drosophila melanogaster populations within a few decades, but was thought to be absent from close relatives, including D. simulans. Five decades after the spread in D. melanogaster, we provide evidence that the P-element has also invaded D. simulans. P-elements in D. simulans appears to have been acquired recently from D. melanogaster probably via a single horizontal transfer event. Expression data indicate that the P-element is processed in the germline of D. simulans, and genomic data show an enrichment of P-element insertions in putative origins of replication, similar to that seen in D. melanogaster. This ongoing spread of the P-element in natural populations provides an unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of transposable element spreads and the associated piRNA defense mechanisms."
10.1101/013706,"Aerobic exercise capacity can influence many complex traits including obesity and type 2 diabetes. We established two rat lines by divergent selection of intrinsic aerobic capacity. The high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR) differed by ~9-fold in aerobic capacity after 32 generations, and diverged in body fat, blood glucose, and other health indicators. To study the interplay among genetic differentiation, age, and strenuous exercise, we performed microarray-based gene expression analyses in skeletal muscle with a 2x2x2 design to compare HCR and LCR, old and young animals, and between rest and exhaustion, for a total of eight groups (n=6 each). Transcripts for mitochondrial function are expressed higher in HCR than LCR at both rest and exhaustion, for both age groups. Extracellular matrix components decrease with age in both lines and both rest and exhaustion. Interestingly, age-effects in many pathways are more pronounced in LCR, suggesting that HCRs higher innate aerobic capacity underlies both increased lifespan and heathspan."
10.1101/013805,"The deluge of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and expanding database poses higher requirements for protein similarity search. State-of-the-art tools such as BLAST are not fast enough to cope with these requirements. Because of that it is necessary to create new algorithms that will be faster while keeping similar sensitivity levels. The majority of protein similarity search methods are based on a seed-and-extend approach which uses standard dynamic programming algorithms in the extend phase. In this paper we present a SW#db tool and library for exact similarity search. Although its running times, as standalone tool, are comparable to running times of BLAST it is primarily designed for the extend phase where there are reduced number of candidates in the database. It uses both GPU and CPU parallelization and when we measured multiple queries on Swiss-prot and Uniref90 databases SW#db was 4 time faster than SSEARCH, 6-10 times faster than CUDASW++ and more than 20 times faster than SSW."
10.1101/013789,"The generalization of the second Chargaff rule to values of k larger than 1, states that the frequency of any k-mer on a single strand almost equals that of its inverse (reverse-complement). We demonstrate the validity of the generalized rule up to k=10 for all human chromosomes. Moreover, this Inversion Symmetry holds for many species, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, for ranges of k which may vary from 7 to 10 as chromosomal lengths vary from 2Mbp up to 200 Mbp. We demonstrate that the statistical distributions of inverted pairs of k-mers are very different from other natral pairings of k-mers, implying that inversion symmetry is a basic principle of chromosomal structure. We suggest that it came into being because genomic evolution employed many rearrangements which conisted of inversions of chromosomal sections; on length scales down to order 1-10Kbp. Model simulations substantiate this claim.Low-scale inversions during chromosomal evolution imply that IS may exist for short sections of human chromosomes. This is indeed the case: we find that chromosome sections of length 5Kbp satisfy IS for k=1 and k=2. The largest value of k for which IS holds,which we call the k-limit of IS, increases logarithmically as the section length increases. The logarithmic dependence of the k-limit on the length of the chromosome is a universal characteristic, observed throughout the tree of life."
10.1101/013797,"Intracellular protein copy numbers show significant cell-to-cell variability within an isogenic population due to the random nature of biological reactions. Here we show how the variability in copy number can be controlled by perturbing gene expression. Depending on the genetic network and host, different perturbations can be applied to control variability. To understand more fully how noise propagates and behaves in biochemical networks we developed stochastic control analysis (SCA) which is a sensitivity-based analysis framework for the study of noise control. Here we apply SCA to synthetic gene expression systems encoded on plasmids that are transformed into Escherichia coli. We show that (1) dual control of transcription and translation efficiencies provides the most efficient way of noise-vs.-mean control. (2) The expressed proteins follow the gamma distribution function as found in chromosomal proteins. (3) One of the major sources of noise, leading to the cell-to-cell variability in protein copy numbers, is related to bursty translation. (4) By taking into account stochastic fluctuations in autofluorescence, the correct scaling relationship between the noise and mean levels of the protein copy numbers was recovered for the case of weak fluorescence signals."
10.1101/013870,"It is believed that metastasis through the cardiovascular system is primarily caused by circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We report an approach to eliminate circulating tumor cells from the blood stream by flowing the blood though an extracorporeal tube and applying photodynamic therapy (PDT). Chlorin e6 (Ce6), a photosensizer, was conjugated to antibody CD44 in order to target PC-3, a prostate cancer cell line. PC-3 cells were successfully stained by the Ce6-CD44 antibody conjugate. PDT was performed on whole blood spiked with stained PC-3 cells. As the blood circulated through a transparent medical tube, it was exposed to light of a specific wavelength generated by an LED array. A 2 minute exposure was sufficient to achieve selective cancer cell necrosis. Control studies showed no cell death."
10.1101/013862,"1 MotivationPhylogenetic estimates from published studies can be archived using general platforms like Dryad (Vision, 2010) or TreeBASE (Sanderson et al., 1994). Such services fulfill a crucial role in ensuring transparency and reproducibility in phylogenetic research. However, digital tree data files often require some editing (e.g. rerooting) to improve the accuracy and reusability of the phylogenetic statements. Furthermore, establishing the mapping between tip labels used in a tree and taxa in a single common taxonomy dramatically improves the ability of other researchers to reuse phylogenetic estimates. Because the process of curating a published phylogenetic estimate is not error-free, retaining a full record of the provenance of edits to a tree is crucial for openness, allowing editors to receive credit for their work, and making errors introduced during curation easier to correct.\n\n2 ResultsHere we report the development of software infrastructure to support the open curation of phylogenetic data by the community of biologists. The backend of the system provides an interface for the standard database operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting records by making commits to a git repository. The record of the history of edits to a tree is preserved by gits version control features. Hosting this data store on GitHub (2014) provides open access to the data store using tools familiar to many developers. We have deployed a server running the \""phylesystem-api\"", which wraps the interactions with git and GitHub. The Open Tree of Life project has also developed and deployed a JavaScript application that uses the phylesystem-api and other web services to enable input and curation of published phylogenetic statements.\n\n3 AvailabilitySource code for the web service layer is available at https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/phylesystem-api.

10.1101/013771,"Whole-genome sequencing has become an indispensible tool of modern biology. However, the cost of sample preparation relative to the cost of sequencing remains high, especially for small genomes where the former is dominant. Here we present a protocol for the rapid and inexpensive preparation of hundreds of multiplexed genomic libraries for Illumina sequencing. By carrying out the Nextera tagmentation reaction in small volumes, replacing costly reagents with cheaper equivalents, and omitting unnecessary steps, we achieve a cost of library preparation of $8 per sample, approximately 6 times cheaper than the widely-used Nextera XT protocol. Furthermore, our procedure takes less than 5 hours for 96 samples and uses nanograms of genomic DNA. Many hundreds of samples can then be pooled on the same HiSeq lane via custom barcodes. Our method is especially useful for re-sequencing of large numbers of full microbial or viral genomes, including those from evolution experiments, genetic screens, and environmental samples."
10.1101/013854,"RNA-seq is a powerful tool for gene expression profiling and differential expression analysis. Its power depends on sequencing depth which limits its high-throughput potential, with 10-15 million reads considered as optimal balance between quality of differential expression calling and cost per sample. We observed, however, that some statistical features of the data, e.g. gene count distribution, are preserved well below 10-15M reads, and found that they improve differential expression analysis at low sequencing depths when distribution statistics is estimated by pooling individual samples to a combined higher-depth library. Using a novel gene-by-gene scaling technique, based on the fact that gene counts obey Pareto-like distribution1, we re-normalize samples towards bigger sequencing depth and show that this leads to significant improvement in differential expression calling, with only a marginal increase in false positive calls. This makes differential expression calling from 3-4M reads comparable to 10-15M reads, improving high-throughput of RNA-sequencing 3-4 fold."
10.1101/013813,"1Biological soil crusts (BSC) are key components of ecosystem productivity in arid lands and they cover a substantial fraction of the terrestrial surface. In particular, BSC N2-fixation contributes significantly to the nitrogen (N) budget of arid land ecosystems. In mature crusts, N2-fixation is largely attributed to heterocystous cyanobacteria, however, early successional crusts possess few N2-fixing cyanobacteria and this suggests that microorganisms other than cyanobacteria mediate N2-fixation during the critical early stages of BSC development. DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with 15N2 revealed that Clostridiaceae and Proteobacteria are the most common microorganisms that assimilate 15N2 in early successional crusts. The Clostridiaceae identified are divergent from previously characterized isolates, though N2fixation has previously been observed in this family. The Proteobacteria identified share >98.5 %SSU rRNA gene sequence identity with isolates from genera known to possess diazotrophs (e.g. Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Shigella, and Ideonella). The low abundance of these heterotrophic diazotrophs in BSC may explain why they have not been characterized previously. Diazotrophs play a critical role in BSC formation and characterization of these organisms represents a crucial step towards understanding how anthropogenic change will affect the formation and ecological function of BSC in arid ecosystems."
10.1101/013763,"BackgroundClone libraries provide researchers with a powerful resource with which to study nucleic acid from diverse sources. Metagenomic clone libraries in particular have aided in studies of microbial biodiversity and function, as well as allowed the mining of novel enzymes for specific functions of interest. These libraries are often constructed by cloning large-inserts ([~]30 kb) into a cosmid or fosmid vector. Recently, there have been reports of GC bias in fosmid metagenomic clone libraries, and it was speculated that the bias may be a result of fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences during the cloning process. However, evidence in the literature suggests that transcriptional activity or gene product toxicity may play a role in library bias.\n\nResultsTo explore the possible mechanisms responsible for sequence bias in clone libraries, and in particular whether fragmentation is involved, we constructed a cosmid clone library from a human microbiome sample, and sequenced DNA from three different steps of the library construction process: crude extract DNA, size-selected DNA, and cosmid library DNA. We confirmed a GC bias in the final constructed cosmid library, and we provide strong evidence that the sequence bias is not due to fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences but is likely occurring after the DNA is introduced into E. coli. To investigate the influence of strong constitutive transcription, we searched the sequence data for consensus promoters and found that rpoD/{sigma}70 promoter sequences were underrepresented in the cosmid library. Furthermore, when we examined the reference genomes of taxa that were differentially abundant in the cosmid library relative to the original sample, we found that the bias appears to be more closely correlated with the number of rpoD/{sigma}70 consensus sequences in the genome than with simple GC content.\n\nConclusionsThe GC bias of metagenomic clone libraries does not appear to be due to DNA fragmentation. Rather, analysis of promoter consensus sequences provides support for the hypothesis that strong constitutive transcription from sequences recognized as rpoD/{sigma}70 consensus-like in E. coli may lead to plasmid instability or loss of insert DNA. Our results suggest that despite widespread use of E. coli to propagate foreign DNA, the effects of in vivo transcriptional activity may be under-appreciated. Further work is required to tease apart the effects of transcription from those of gene product toxicity."
10.1101/013821,"IAA plays a critical role in regulating numerous aspects of plant growth and development. While there is much genetic support for tryptophan-dependent (Trp-D) IAA synthesis pathways, there is little genetic evidence for tryptophan-independent (Trp-I) IAA synthesis pathways. Using Arabidopsis, we identified two mutant alleles of ISS1 (Indole Severe Sensitive) that display indole-dependent IAA overproduction phenotypes including leaf epinasty and adventitious rooting. Stable isotope labeling showed that iss1, but not WT, uses primarily Trp-I IAA synthesis when grown on indolesupplemented medium. In contrast, both iss1 and WT use primarily Trp-D IAA synthesis when grown on unsupplemented medium. iss1 seedlings produce 8-fold higher levels of IAA when grown on indole and surprisingly have a 174-fold increase in Trp. These findings indicate that the iss1 mutants increase in Trp-I IAA synthesis is due to a loss of Trp catabolism. ISS1 was identified as At1g80360, a predicted aromatic aminotransferase, and in vitro and in vivo analysis confirmed this activity. At1g80360 was previously shown to primarily carry out the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid to Trp as an IAA homeostatic mechanism in young seedlings. Our results suggest that in addition to this activity, in more mature plants ISS1 has a role in Trp catabolism and possibly in the metabolism of other aromatic amino acids. We postulate that this loss of Trp catabolism impacts the use of Trp-D and/or Trp-I IAA synthesis pathways."
10.1101/013839,"High-throughput experiments such as microarrays and deep sequencing provide large scale information on the pattern of gene expression, which undergoes extensive remodeling as the cell dynamically responds to varying environmental cues or has its function disrupted under pathological conditions. An important initial step in the systematic analysis and interpretation of genome-scale expression alteration involves identification of a set of perturbed transcriptional regulators whose differential activity can provide a proximate hypothesis to account for these transcriptomic changes. In the present work, we propose an unbiased and logically natural approach to transcription factor enrichment. It involves overlaying a list of experimentally determined differentially expressed genes on a background regulatory network coming from e.g. literature curation or computational motif scanning, and identifying that subset of regulators whose aggregated target set best discriminates between the altered and the unaffected genes. In other words, our methodology entails testing of all possible regulatory subnetworks, rather than just the target sets of individual regulators as is followed in most standard approaches. We have proposed an iterative search method to efficiently find such a combination, and benchmarked it on E. coli microarray and regulatory network data available in the public domain. Comparative analysis carried out on simulated differential expression profiles, as well as empirical factor overexpression data for M. tuberculosis, shows that our methodology provides marked improvement in accuracy of regulatory inference relative to the standard method that involves evaluating factor enrichment in an individual manner."
10.1101/013581,"Copper is essential for life but toxic, therefore all organisms control tightly its intracellular abundance. Bacteria have indeed whole operons devoted to copper resistance, with genes that code for efflux pumps, oxidases, etc. Recently, the CopM protein of the CopMRS operon was described as a novel important element for copper tolerance in Synechocystis. This protein consists of a domain of unknown function, and was proposed to act as a periplasmic/extracellular copper binder. This work describes a bioinformatic study of CopM including structural models based on homology modeling and on residue coevolution, to help expand on its recent biochemical characterization. The protein is predicted to be periplasmic but membrane-anchored, not secreted. Two disordered regions are predicted, both possibly involved in protein-protein interactions. The 3D models disclose a 4-helix bundle with several potential copper-binding sites, most of them largely buried inside the bundle lumen. Some of the predicted copper-binding sites involve residues from the disordered regions, suggesting they could gain structure upon copper binding and thus possibly modulate the interactions they mediate.

10.1101/013953,"BackgroundThe tetrapod limb is a highly diverse structure, and reduction of the limbs accounts for much of the phenotypes observed within species. Squamate reptiles represent one of the many lineages in which the limbs have been greatly modified from the pentadactyl generalized pattern; within the group, limb-reduced morphologies can vary from minor reductions in size of elements to complete limblessness, with several intermediate forms in between. Even though limb reduction is widespread, it is not clear what are the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms involved in the formation of reduced limb morphologies.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we present an overview of limb morphology within the microteiid lizard group Gymnophthalmidae, focusing on digit number.\n\nResultsWe show that there are two major groups of limb-reduced gymnophthalmids. The first group is formed by lizard-like - and frequently pentadactyl - species, in which minor reductions (such as the loss of 1-2 phalanges mainly in digits I and V) are the rule; these morphologies generally correspond to those seen in other squamates. The second group is formed by species showing more drastic losses, which can include the absence of an externally distinct limb in adults. We also show the expression patterns of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the greatly reduced fore and hindlimb of a serpentiform gymnophthalmid.\n\nConclusionsOur discussion focus on identifying shared patterns of limb reduction among tetrapods, and explaining these patterns and the morphological variation within the gymnophthalmids based on the current knowledge of the molecular signaling pathways that coordinate limb development."
10.1101/013938,"The influence of resource availability on planktonic and biofilm microbial community membership is poorly understood. Heterotrophic bacteria derive some to all of their organic carbon (C) from photoautotrophs while simultaneously competing with photoautotrophs for inorganic nutrients such as phosphorus (P) or nitrogen (N). Therefore, C inputs have the potential to shift the competitive balance of aquatic microbial communities by increasing the resource space available to heterotrophs (more C) while decreasing the resource space available to photoautotrophs (less mineral nutrients due to increased competition from heterotrophs). To test how resource dynamics affect membership of planktonic communities and assembly of biofilm communities we amended a series of flow-through mesocosms with C to alter the availability of C among treatments. Each mesocosm was fed with unfiltered seawater and incubated with sterilized microscope slides as surfaces for biofilm formation. The highest C treatment had the highest planktonic heterotroph abundance, lowest planktonic photoautotroph abundance, and highest biofilm biomass. We surveyed bacterial 16S rRNA genes and plastid 23S rRNA genes to characterize biofilm and planktonic community membership and structure. Regardless of resource additions, biofilm communities had higher alpha diversity than planktonic communities in all mesocosms. Heterotrophic plankton communities were distinct from heterotrophic biofilm communities in all but the highest C treatment where heterotrophic plankton and biofilm communities resembled each other after 17 days. Unlike the heterotrophs, photoautotrophic plankton communities were different than photoautotrophic biofilm communities in composition in all treatments including the highest C treatment. Our results suggest that although resource amendments affect community membership and structure, microbial lifestyle (biofilm versus planktonic) has a stronger influence on community composition."
10.1101/013946,"Transcriptome-enabled phylogenetic analyses have dramatically improved our understanding of metazoan phylogeny in recent years, although several important questions remain. The branching order near the base of the tree is one such outstanding issue. To address this question we assemble a novel data set comprised of 1,080 orthologous loci derived from 36 publicly available genomes and dissect the phylogenetic signal present in each individual partition. The size of this data set allows for a closer look at the potential biases and sources of non-phylogenetic signal. We assessed a range of measures for each data partition including information content, saturation, rate of evolution, long-branch score, and taxon occupancy and explored how each of these characteristics impacts phylogeny estimation. We then used these data to prepare a reduced set of partitions that fit an optimal set of criteria and are amenable to the most appropriate and computationally intensive analyses using site-heterogeneous models of sequence evolution. We also employed several strategies to examine the potential for long-branch attraction to bias our inferences. All of our analyses support Ctenophora as the sister lineage to other Metazoa, although support for this relationship varies among analyses. We find no support for the traditional view uniting the ctenophores and Cnidaria (jellies, anemones, corals, and kin). We also examine phylogenetic placement of myriapods (centipedes and millipedes) and find it more sensitive to the type of analysis and data used.

10.1101/013912,"Cytoplasmic degradation of endogenous RNAs is an integral part of RNA quality control (RQC) and often relies on the removal of the 5' cap structure and their subsequent 5 to 3 degradation in cytoplasmic processing (P-)bodies. In parallel, many eukaryotes degrade exogenous and selected endogenous RNAs through post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). In plants, PTGS depends on small interfering (si)RNAs produced after the conversion of single-stranded RNAs to double-stranded RNAs by the cellular RNA DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) in cytoplasmic siRNA-bodies. PTGS and RQC compete for transgene-derived RNAs, but it is unknown whether this competition also occurs for endogenous transcripts. We show that the lethality of decapping mutants is suppressed by impairing RDR6 activity. We establish that upon decapping impairment hundreds of endogenous mRNAs give rise to a new class of rqc-siRNAs, that over-accumulate when RQC processes are impaired, a subset of which depending on RDR6 for their production. We observe that P- and siRNA-bodies often are dynamically juxtaposed, potentially allowing for crosstalk of the two machineries. Our results suggest that the decapping of endogenous RNA limits their entry into the PTGS pathway. We anticipate that the rqc-siRNAs identified in decapping mutants represent a subset of a larger ensemble of endogenous siRNAs."

10.1101/013995,"BackgroundSearching for similar compounds in a database is the most important process for in-silico drug screening. Since a query compound is an important starting point for the new drug, a query holder, who is afraid of the query being monitored by the database server, usually downloads all the records in the database and uses them in a closed network. However, a serious dilemma arises when the database holder also wants to output no information except for the search results, and such a dilemma prevents the use of many important data resources.\n\nResultsIn order to overcome this dilemma, we developed a novel cryptographic protocol that enables database searching while keeping both the query holders privacy and database holders privacy. Generally, the application of cryptographic techniques to practical problems is difficult because versatile techniques are computationally expensive while computationally inexpensive techniques can perform only trivial computation tasks. In this study, our protocol is successfully built only from an additive-homomorphic cryptosystem, which allows only addition performed on encrypted values but is computationally efficient compared with versatile techniques such as general purpose multi-party computation. In an experiment searching ChEMBL, which consists of more than 1,200,000 compounds, the proposed method was 36,900 times faster in CPU time and 12,000 times as efficient in communication size compared with general purpose multi-party computation.\n\nConclusionWe proposed a novel privacy-preserving protocol for searching chemical compound databases. The proposed method, easily scaling for large-scale databases, may help to accelerate drug discovery research by making full use of unused but valuable data that includes sensitive information."
10.1101/014027,"Many phytophagous insect species are ecologic specialists that have adapted to utilize a single host plant. Drosophila sechellia is a specialist that utilizes the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia, which is toxic to its sibling species, D. simulans. Here we apply multiplexed shotgun genotyping and QTL analysis to examine the genetic basis of resistance to M. citrifolia fruit toxin in interspecific hybrids. We find that at least four dominant and four recessive loci interact additively to confer resistance to the M. citrifolia fruit toxin. These QTL include a dominant locus of large effect on the third chromosome (QTL-IIIsima) that was not detected in previous analyses. The small-effect loci that we identify overlap with regions that were identified in selection experiments with D. simulans on octanoic acid and in QTL analyses of adult resistance to octanoic acid. Our high-resolution analysis sheds new light upon the complexity of M. citrifolia resistance, and suggests that partial resistance to lower levels of M. citrifolia toxin could be passed through introgression from D. sechellia to D. simulans in nature. The identification of a locus of major effect, QTL-IIIsima, is an important step towards identifying the molecular basis of host plant specialization by D. sechellia."
10.1101/013987,"Reasons why chromosomal rearrangements spread to fixation and frequently distinguish related taxa remain poorly understood. We used cytological descriptions of karyotype to identify large pericentric inversions between species of Estrildid finches (family Estrildidae) and a time-dated phylogeny to assess the genomic, geographic, and phylogenetic context of karyotype evolution in this group. Inversions between finch species fixed at an average rate of one every 2.26 My. Inversions were twice as likely to fix on the sex chromosomes compared to the autosomes, possibly a result of their repeat density, and inversion fixation rate for all chromosomes scales with range size. Alternative mutagenic input explanations are not supported, as the number of inversions on a chromosome does not correlate with its length or map size. Inversions have fixed 3.3x faster in three continental clades than in two island chain clades, and fixation rate correlates with both range size and the number of sympatric species pairs. These results point to adaptation as the dominant mechanism driving fixation and suggest a role for gene flow in karyotype divergence. A review shows that the rapid karyotype evolution observed in the Estrildid finches appears to be more general across birds, and by implication other understudied taxa."
10.1101/013888,"The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)1 revolutionized Human Genetics by allowing us to generate pluripotent cells from easily accessible somatic tissues. This technology can have immense implications for regenerative medicine, but iPSCs also represent a paradigm shift in the study of complex human phenotypes, including gene regulation and disease2-5. Yet, an unresolved caveat of the iPSC model system is the extent to which reprogrammed iPSCs retain residual phenotypes from their precursor somatic cells. To directly address this issue, we used an effective study design to compare regulatory phenotypes between iPSCs derived from two types of commonly used somatic precursor cells. We show that the cell type of origin only minimally affects gene expression levels and DNA methylation in iPSCs. Instead, genetic variation is the main driver of regulatory differences between iPSCs of different donors."
10.1101/013979,"Transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq has emerged as a high-throughput, cost-effective means to evaluate the expression pattern of genes in organisms. Unlike other methods, such as microarrays or quantitative PCR, RNA-seq is a target free method that permits analysis of essentially any RNA that can be amplified from a cell or tissue. At its most basic, RNA-seq can determine individual gene expression levels by counting the number of times a particular transcript was found in the sequence data. Transcript levels can be compared across multiple samples to identify differentially expressed genes and infer differences in biological states between the samples. We have used this approach to examine gene expression patterns in chicken and human cells, with particular interest in determining response to heat stress."
10.1101/014035,"The marker-assisted selection exploits anonymous genetic markers that have been associated with measurable differences on complex traits; because it is based on the Linkage Disequilibrium between the polymorphic markers and the polymorphisms which code for the trait, its success is limited to the population in which the association has been assessed. The identification of the gene with effect on the target and the detection of the functional mutations will allow selection in independent populations, while encouraging studies on gene expression. The results of a genome-wide scan performed with the Illumina Ovine SNP50K Beadchip, on 100 sheep, 50 of which positive at paratuberculosis serological assessment, identified two candidate genes of immunity response, the PCP4 and the CD109, located in proximity of the markers with different allele frequency in positive and negative sheep. The coding region of the two genes was directly sequenced: three missense mutations were detected: two in the PCP4 gene and one in the second exon of the CD109 gene. The PCP4 mutations had a very low frequency (.12 and .07) so making hazardous to hypothesize their direct effect on immune response. On the contrary, the mutation detected in the CD109 gene showed a strong linkage disequilibrium with the anonymous marker. Direct sequencing of the DNA of sheep of different populations showed that disequilibrium was maintained. Allele frequency at the hypothesized marker associated to immune response, calculated for other breeds of sheep, showed that the marker allele potentially associated to disease resistance is more frequent in the local breeds and in breeds that have not been submitted to selection programs."
10.1101/014068,"High-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled expansion of the scope of genetic screens to identify mutations that underlie quantitative phenotypes, such as fitness improvements that occur during the course of experimental evolution. This new capability has allowed us to describe the relationship between fitness and genotype at a level never possible before, and ask deeper questions, such as how genome structure, available mutation spectrum, and other factors drive evolution. Here we combined functional genomics and experimental evolution to first map on a genome scale the distribution of potential beneficial mutations available as a first step to an evolving population and then compare these to the mutations actually observed in order to define the constraints acting upon evolution. We first constructed a single-step fitness landscape for the yeast genome by using barcoded gene deletion and overexpression collections, competitive growth in continuous culture, and barcode sequencing. By quantifying the relative fitness effects of thousands of single-gene amplifications or deletions simultaneously we revealed the presence of hundreds of accessible evolutionary paths. To determine the actual mutation spectrum used in evolution, we built a catalog of >1000 mutations selected during experimental evolution. By combining both datasets, we were able to ask how and why evolution is constrained. We identified adaptive mutations in laboratory evolved populations, derived mutational signatures in a variety of conditions and ploidy states, and determined that half of the mutations accumulated positively affect cellular fitness. We also uncovered hundreds of potential beneficial mutations never observed in the mutational spectrum derived from the experimental evolution catalog and found that those adaptive mutations become accessible in the absence of the dominant adaptive solution. This comprehensive functional screen explored the set of potential adaptive mutations on one genetic background, and allows us for the first time at this scale to compare the mutational path with the actual, spontaneously derived spectrum of mutations.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhole genome sequencing of thousands of cancer genomes has been conducted to characterize variants including point mutations and structural changes, providing a large catalogue of critical polymorphisms associated with tumorigenesis. Despite the high prevalence of mutations in cancer and technological advances in their genotyping, cancer genetics still presents many open questions regarding the prediction of selection and the functional impact of mutations on cellular fitness. Long term experimental evolution using model organisms has allowed the selection for strains bearing recurrent and rare mutations, mimicking the genetic aberrations acquired by tumor cells. Here, we evaluate the functional impact of thousands of single gene losses and amplifications on the cellular fitness of yeast. Our results show that hundreds of beneficial mutations are possible during adaptation but not all of them have been selected in evolution experiments so far performed. Together, our results provide evidence that 50% of the mutations found in experimentally evolved populations are advantageous, and that alternative mutations with improved fitness could be selected in the absence of the main adaptive mutations with higher fitness.\n\nBLURBA combined view of potential adaptive mutations, generated by a systematic screening approach, coupled with the mutational spectrum derived from experimentally evolved yeast reveals the usage of accessible evolutionary solutions."
10.1101/014050,"We describe the discovery of a new genetic syndrome, RykDax syndrome, driven by a whole genome sequencing (WGS) study of one family from Utah with two affected male brothers, presenting with severe intellectual disability (ID), a characteristic intergluteal crease, and very distinctive facial features including a broad, upturned nose, sagging cheeks, downward sloping palpebral fissures, prominent periorbital ridges, deep-set eyes, relative hypertelorism, thin upper lip, a high-arched palate, prominent ears with thickened helices, and a pointed chin. This Caucasian family was recruited from Utah, USA. Illumina-based WGS was performed on 10 members of this family, with additional Complete Genomics-based WGS performed on the nuclear portion of the family (mother, father and the two affected males). Using WGS datasets from 10 members of this family, we can increase the reliability of the biological inferences with an integrative bioinformatic pipeline. In combination with insights from clinical evaluations and medical diagnostic analyses, these DNA sequencing data were used in the study of three plausible genetic disease models that might uncover genetic contribution to the syndrome. We found a 2 to 5-fold difference in the number of variants detected as being relevant for various disease models when using different sets of sequencing data and analysis pipelines. We de-rived greater accuracy when more pipelines were used in conjunction with data encompassing a larger portion of the family, with the number of putative de-novo mutations being reduced by 80%, due to false negative calls in the parents. The boys carry a maternally inherited mis-sense variant in a X-chromosomal gene TAF1, which we consider as disease relevant. TAF1 is the largest subunit of the general transcription factor IID (TFIID) multi-protein complex, and our results implicate mutations in TAF1 as playing a critical role in the development of this new intellectual disability syndrome."
10.1101/014076,"Insight, Innovation and IntegrationDoxycycline, a derivative of tetracycline, induces gene expression via reversible transcriptional activation. Levels of /3-catenin and other intra/extracellular genetic factors have been influenced in colorectal cancer cell lines, which make doxycycline a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy. With the aim to build better computational models that show good prediction on test datasets, doxycycline treated cell lines might provide best training samples. This work tests the reproducibility of parameter learning and predictions based on the estimated parameters, using the Naive Bayesian Networks for Wnt pathway in case of missing observations for different nodes. The in silico experiments show the efficacy of causal models as one of the emerging diagnostic tools in development of targeted cancer therapy.\n\nRecent efforts in predicting Wnt signaling activation via inference methods have helped in developing diagnostic models for therapeutic drug targeting. In this manuscript the reproducibility of parameter learning with missing observations in a Bayesian Network and its effect on prediction results for Wnt signaling activation is tested, while training the networks on doxycycline treated LS174T cell lines as well as normal and adenomas samples. This is done in order to check the effectiveness of using Bayesian Network as a tool for modeling Wnt pathway when certain observations are missing. Experimental analysis suggest that prediction results are reproducible with negligible deviations. Anomalies in estimated parameters are accounted for due to the Bayesian Network model. Also, an interesting case regarding usage of hypothesis testing came up while proving the statistical significance of different design setups of the BN model which was trained on the same data. It was found that hypothesis testing may not be the correct way to check the significance between design setups for the aforementioned case, especially when the structure of the model is same. Finally, in comparison to the biologically inspired models, the naive bayesian model may give accurate results but this accuracy comes at the cost of loss of crucial biological knowledge which might help reveal hidden relations among intra/extracellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway."
10.1101/014126,"With the advent of RNA-sequencing technology we now have the power to detect different types of alternative splicing and how DNA variation affects splicing. However, given the short read lengths used in most population based RNA-sequencing experiments, quantifying transcripts accurately remains a challenge. Here we present a novel method, Altrans, for discovery of alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (asQTLs). To assess the performance of Altrans we compared it to Cufflinks, a well-established transcript quantification method. Simulations show that in the presence of transcripts absent from the annotation, Altrans performs better in quantifications than Cufflinks. We have applied Altrans and Cufflinks to the Geuvadis dataset, which comprises samples from European and African populations, and discovered (FDR = 1%) 1806 and 243 asQTLs with Altrans, and 1596 and 288 asQTLs with Cufflinks for Europeans and Africans, respectively. Although Cufflinks results replicated better across the two populations, this likely due to the increased sensitivity of Altrans in detecting harder to detect associations. We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (94% and 98% replication in Altrans and Cufflinks, respectively). We find that method specific asQTLs are largely due to different types of alternative splicing events detected by each method. We overlapped the asQTLs with biochemically active regions of the genome and observed significant enrichments for many functional marks and variants in splicing regions, highlighting the biological relevance of the asQTLs identified. All together, we present a novel approach for discovering asQTLs that is a more direct assessment of splicing compared to other methods and is complementary to other transcript quantification methods."

10.1101/014183,"We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of human influenza A H3 hemagglutinin evolution, considering three distinct predictors of evolutionary variation at individual sites: solvent accessibility (as a proxy for protein fold stability and/or conservation), experimental epitope sites (as a proxy for host immune bias), and proximity to the receptor-binding region (as a proxy for protein function). We found that these three predictors individually explain approximately 15% of the variation in site-wise dN/dS. The solvent accessibility and proximity predictors were largely independent of each other, while the epitope sites were not. In combination, solvent accessibility and proximity explained 32% of the variation in dN/dS. Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model added only an additional 2 percentage points. We also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s, showed only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data. Finally, sites with dN/dS > 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, and not host immune bias, seems to be the primary determinant of H3 evolution.\n\nAuthor summaryThe influenza virus is one of the most rapidly evolving human viruses. Every year, it accumulates mutations that allow it to evade the host immune response of previously infected individuals. Which sites in the virus genome allow this immune escape and the manner of escape is not entirely understood, but conventional wisdom states that specific \""immune epitope sites\"" in the protein hemagglutinin are preferentially attacked by host antibodies and that these sites mutate to directly avoid host recognition; as a result, these sites are commonly targeted by vaccine development efforts. Here, we combine influenza hemagglutinin sequence data, protein structural information, experimental immune epitope data, and historical epitopes to demonstrate that neither the historical epitope groups nor epitopes based on experimental data are crucial for predicting the rate of influenza evolution. Instead, we find that a simple geometrical model works best: sites that are closest to the location where the virus binds the human receptor are the primary driver of hemagglutinin evolution. There are two possible explanations for this result. First, the existing historical and experimental epitope sites may not be the real antigenic sites in hemagglutinin. Second, alternatively, hemagglutinin antigenicity may not the primary driver of influenza evolution."
10.1101/014001,"During the last decade genome-wide association studies have proven to be a powerful approach to identifying disease-causing variants. However, for admixed populations, most current methods for performing association testing are based on the assumption that the effect of a genetic variant is the same regardless of its ancestry. This is a reasonable assumption for a causal variant, but may not hold for the genetic variants that are tested in genome-wide association studies, which are usually not causal. The effects of non-causal genetic variants depend on how strongly their presence correlate with the presence of the causal variant, which may vary between ancestral populations because of different linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies.\n\nMotivated by this, we here introduce a new statistical method for association testing in recently admixed populations, where the effect size is allowed to depend on the ancestry of a given allele. Our method does not rely on accurate inference of local ancestry, yet using simulations we show that in some scenarios it gives a dramatic increase in statistical power to detect associations. In addition, the method allows for testing for difference in effect size between ancestral populations, which can be used to help determine if a SNP is causal. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on data from the Greenlandic population."
10.1101/014100,"Genomic selection, enabled by whole genome prediction (WGP) methods, is revolutionizing plant breeding. Existing WGP methods have been shown to deliver accurate predictions in the most common settings, such as prediction of across environment performance for traits with additive gene effects. However, prediction of traits with non-additive gene effects and prediction of genotype by environment interaction (GxE), continues to be challenging. Previous attempts to increase prediction accuracy for these particularly difficult tasks employed prediction methods that are purely statistical in nature. Augmenting the statistical methods with biological knowledge has been largely overlooked thus far. Crop growth models (CGMs) attempt to represent the impact of functional relationships between plant physiology and the environment in the formation of yield and similar output traits of interest. Thus, they can explain the impact of GxE and certain types of non-additive gene effects on the expressed phenotype. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a novel and powerful computational procedure, allows the incorporation of CGMs directly into the estimation of whole genome marker effects in WGP. Here we provide a proof of concept study for this novel approach and demonstrate its use with synthetic data sets. We show that this novel approach can be considerably more accurate than the benchmark WGP method GBLUP in predicting performance in environments represented in the estimation set as well as in previously unobserved environments for traits determined by non-additive gene effects. We conclude that this proof of concept demonstrates that using ABC for incorporating biological knowledge in the form of CGMs into WGP is a very promising and novel approach to improving prediction accuracy for some of the most challenging scenarios in plant breeding and applied genetics."
10.1101/014118,"Strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide, is caused by Streptococcus equi. Despite its prevalence, the global diversity and mechanisms underlying the evolution of S. equi as a host-restricted pathogen remain poorly understood. Here we define the global population structure of this important pathogen and reveal a population replacement in the late 19th or early 20th century, contemporaneous with a spate of global conflicts. Our data reveal a dynamic genome that continues to mutate and decay, but also to amplify and acquire genes despite the organism having lost its natural competence and become host-restricted.\n\nThe lifestyle of S. equi within the horse is defined by short-term acute disease, strangles, followed by long-term carriage. Population analysis reveals evidence of convergent evolution in isolates from post-acute disease samples, as a result of niche adaptation to persistent carriage within a host. Mutations that lead to metabolic streamlining and the loss of virulence determinants are more frequently found in carriage isolates, suggesting that the pathogenic potential of S. equi reduces as a consequence of long term residency within the horse post acute disease. An example of this is the deletion of the equibactin siderophore locus that is associated with iron acquisition, which occurs exclusively in carrier isolates, and renders S. equi significantly less able to cause acute disease in the natural host. We identify several loci that may similarly be required for the full virulence of S. equi, directing future research towards the development of new vaccines against this host-restricted pathogen."
10.1101/014167,"The folding of most integral membrane proteins follows a two-step process: Initially, individual transmembrane helices are inserted into the membrane by the Sec translocon. Thereafter, these helices fold to shape the final conformation of the protein. However, for some proteins, including Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), the folding appears to follow a more complicated path. AQP1 has been reported to first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helix 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane. In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the orientation of the third helix is inverted. Here, we propose a mechanism for how this reorientation could be initiated: First, helix 3 slides out from the membrane core resulting in that the preceding loop enters the membrane. The final conformation could then be formed as helix 2, 3 and 4 are inserted into the membrane and the reentrant regions come together. We find support for the first step in this process by showing that the loop preceding helix 3 can insert into the membrane. Further, hydrophobicity curves, experimentally measured insertion efficiencies and MD-simulations suggest that the barrier between these two hydrophobic regions is relatively low, supporting the idea that helix 3 can slide out of the membrane core, initiating the rearrangement process"
10.1101/014175,"The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix, i.e. the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows; the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted, i.e. the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism can obviously not aid C-terminal helices and consequently we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices."
10.1101/014092,"Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is ongoing debate about the neurophysiological implementation of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Specifically, oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (< 30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms (EEG) while human participants were engaged in a visual-tactile pattern matching paradigm. Employing the same physical stimulation, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visual-tactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics within the two tasks related to crossmodal congruence involved effects in the theta-(2-7 Hz), alpha-(813 Hz) and beta-band (13-25 Hz). Contrasting neuronal activity between the two tasks revealed differences in pre-stimulus alpha- and beta-band power, as well as differences in post-stimulus theta-band activity. Source reconstruction for these effects showed prominent involvement of superior temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices - regions commonly implicated in multisensory integration. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are well suited for studying integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visual-tactile pattern matching in the current study. Additionally, neuronal activity at theta-, alpha- and beta-frequencies might subserve distinct processes relevant for multisensory integration, such as multisensory gating and crossmodal perceptual decision making."
10.1101/014134,"Databases of structural connections of the mammalian brain, such as CoCoMac (cocomac.g-node.org) or BAMS (brancusi.usc.edu), are valuable resources for the analysis of brain connectivity and the modeling of brain dynamics in species such as the non-human primate or the rodent, and have also contributed to the computational modeling of the human brain. Another model species that is widely used in electrophysiological or developmental studies is the ferret; however, no systematic compilation of brain connectivity is currently available for this species. Thus, we have started developing a database of anatomical connections and architectonic features of the ferret brain (the Ferretome, www.ferretome.org). The main goals of this database project are: (1) to assemble structural information on the ferret brain that is currently widely distributed in the literature or in different in-house laboratory databases into a single resource which is open to the scientific community; (2) to try and build an extendable community resource that is beneficial to researchers in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, as well as to neuroanatomists, by adding value to their data through algorithms for efficient data representation, analysis and visualization; (3) to create techniques for the representation of quantitative and raw data; and (4) to expand existing database ontologies in order to accommodate further neuroarchitectural information for identifying essential relations between brain structure and connections.\n\nThe Ferretome database has adapted essential features of the CoCoMac methodology and legacy. In particular, its data model is derived from CoCoMac. It also uses a semantic parcellation of ferret brain regions as well as a logical brain maps transformation algorithm (objective relational transformation, ORT). The database is being developed in MySQL and has been populated with literature reports on tract tracing observations in the ferret brain using a custom-designed web interface that allows efficient and validated simultaneous input and proofreading by multiple curators. The database is also equipped with a web interface for generating output data that was designed with non-computer science specialist users in mind. This interface can be extended to produce connectivity matrices in several formats including a graphical representation superimposed on established ferret brain maps. An important feature of the Ferretome database is the possibility to trace back entries in connectivity matrices to the original studies archived in the system.\n\nCurrently, the Ferretome contains 50 reports on connections comprising 20 injection reports with more than 150 labeled source and target areas, the majority reflecting connectivity of subcortical nuclei. We hope that the Ferretome database will become a useful resource for neuroinformatics and neural modeling, and will support studies of the ferret brain as well as facilitate advances in comparative studies of mesoscopic brain connectivity."
10.1101/014159,"The capacity of the human brain to interpret and respond to multiple temporal scales in its surroundings suggests that its internal interactions must also be able to operate over a broad temporal range. In this paper, we utilise a recently introduced method for characterising the rate of change of the phase difference between MEG signals and use it to study the temporal structure of the phase interactions between MEG recordings from the left and right motor cortices during rest and during a finger-tapping task. We use the Hilbert transform to estimate moment-to-moment fluctuations of the phase difference between signals. After confirming the presence of scale-invariance we estimate the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). An exponent of >0.5 is indicative of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the signal. We find that LRTCs are present in the / and {beta} frequency bands of resting state MEG data. We demonstrate that finger movement disrupts LRTCs correlations, producing a phase relationship with a structure similar to that of Gaussian white noise. The results are validated by applying the same analysis to data with Gaussian white noise phase difference, recordings from an empty scanner and phase-shuffled time series. We interpret the findings through comparison of the results with those we obtained from an earlier study during which we adopted this method to characterise phase relationships within a Kuramoto model of oscillators in its sub-critical, critical and super-critical synchronisation states. We find that the resting state MEG from left and right motor cortices shows moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase difference with a similar temporal structure to that of a system of Kuramoto oscillators just prior to its critical level of coupling, and that finger tapping moves the system away from this pre-critical state towards a more random state."
10.1101/014142,"Starting with Savageaus pioneering work from 1970s, here, we choose the simplest transcription network and ask: How does the cell choose a regulatory topology from the different available possibilities? We study the natural distribution of topologies at genome, systems, and micro-level in E. coli and perform stochastic simulations to help explain the differences in natural distributions. Analyzing regulation of amino acid biosynthesis and carbon utilization in E. coli and B. subtilis, we observe many deviations from the demand rules, and observe an alternate pattern emerging. Overall, our results indicate that choice of topology is drawn randomly from a pool of all networks which satisfy the kinetic requirements of the cell, as dictated by physiology. In short, simply, the cell picks \""whatever works\""."
10.1101/014274,"Annotators of text corpora and biomedical databases carry out the same labor-intensive task to manually extract structured data from unstructured text. Tasks are needlessly repeated because text corpora are widely scattered. We envision that a linked annotation resource unifying many corpora could be a game changer. Such an open forum will help focus on novel annotations and on optimally benefiting from the energy of many experts. As proof-of-concept, we annotated protein subcellular localization in 100 abstracts cited by UniProtKB. The detailed comparison between our new corpus and the original UniProtKB annotations revealed sustained novel annotations for 42% of the entries (proteins). In a unified linked annotation resource these could immediately extend the utility of text corpora beyond the text-mining community. Our example motivates the central idea that linked annotations from text corpora can complement database annotations."

A key task in analyzing complex nanopore data is discovering the boundaries between these steps, which has traditionally been done in research labs by hand. We present an automated method of analyzing nanopore data, by detecting regions of ionic current corresponding to the translocation of a biomolecule, and then segmenting the region. The segmenter uses a divide-and-conquer method to recursively discover boundary points, with an implementation that works several times faster than real time and that can handle low-pass filtered signals."
10.1101/014233,"BackgroundAnalysing tumour architecture for metastatic potential usually focuses on phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific genetic mutations, but often ignore the cells position within the heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure is common in mathematical models.\n\nMethodsWe view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game.\n\nResultsWe show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary - such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane - we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow.\n\nInterpretationPathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells. We expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game models where interaction neighborhoods change at fixed system boundaries."
10.1101/014225,"Identifying accurately species is critical for our understanding of patterns of diversity and speciation. However, for many organisms with simple and variable morphological traits, the characters traditionally used by taxonomists to identify species might lead to a considerable under appreciation of their diversity. Recent advances in molecular-data based computational methods have considerably improved our ability to identify and test species limits. Here, we use an integrative approach to delineate species in a complex of sea cucumbers. We used a three-step approach to show that \""Holothuria impatiens\"", a common, shallow-water species, occurring across the Indo-Pacific, the Western Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, targeted locally by fisheries, is a complex of at least 13 species. (1) We used the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model to identify putative species without a priori hypotheses. In the process, we also show that the number of putative species estimated with GMYC can be affected considerably by the priors used to build the input tree. (2) We assessed based on coloration patterns and distributional information, the most relevant hypothesis. This approach allowed us to identify unambiguously 9 species. However, some of the lineages consistently assigned to belong to different species using GMYC, are occurring in sympatry and are not differentiated morphologically. (3) We used Bayes factors to compare competing models of species assignment using the multispecies coalescent as implemented in *BEAST. This approach allowed us to validate that the species identified using GMYC were likely reproductively isolated. Estimates of the timing of diversification also showed that these species diverged less than 2 Ma, which is the fastest case of closely related species occurring in sympatry for a marine metazoan. Our study demonstrates how clarifying species limits contribute to refining our understanding of speciation."
10.1101/014308,"AbstractFleas (order Siphonaptera) are highly-specialized, diverse blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals and birds with an enigmatic evolutionary history and obscure origin. We here present a molecular phylogenetic study based on a comprehensive taxon sampling of 259 flea taxa, representing 16 of the 18 extant families of this order. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree with strong nodal support was recovered, consisting of seven sequentially derived lineages with Macropsyllidae as the earliest divergence, followed by Stephanocircidae. Divergence times of flea lineages were estimated based on fossil records and host specific associations to bats (Chiroptera), suggesting that the common ancestor of extant Siphonaptera diversified during the Cretaceous. However, most of the intraordinal divergence into extant lineages took place after the K-Pg boundary. Ancestral states of host association and biogeographical distribution were reconstructed, suggesting with high likelihood that fleas originated in the southern continents (Gondwana) and migrated from South America to their extant distributions in a relatively short time frame. Theria (placental mammals and marsupials) represent the most likely ancestral host group of extant Siphonaptera, with marsupials occupying a more important role than previously assumed. Major extant flea families evolved in connection to post K-Pg diversification of Placentalia. The association of fleas with monotremes and birds is likely due to later secondary host association. These results suggest caution in casually interpreting recently discovered Mesozoic fossil \""dinosaur fleas\"" of Northeast Asia as part of what we currently consider Siphonaptera."
10.1101/014282,"Estimates for the number of species in the sea vary by orders of magnitude. Molecular taxonomy can greatly speed up screening for diversity and evaluating species boundaries, while gaining insights into the biology of the species. DNA barcoding with a region of cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) is now widely used as a first pass for molecular evaluation of diversity, as it has good potential for identifying cryptic species and improving our understanding of marine biodiversity. We present the results of a large scale barcoding effort for holothuroids (sea cucumbers). We sequenced 3048 individuals from numerous localities spanning the diversity of habitats in which the group occurs, with a particular focus in the shallow tropics (Indo-Pacific and Caribbean) and the Antarctic region. The number of cryptic species is much higher than currently recognized. The vast majority of sister species have allopatric distributions, with species showing genetic differentiation between ocean basins, and some are even differentiated among archipelagos. However, many closely related and sympatric forms, that exhibit distinct color patterns and/or ecology, show little differentiation in, and cannotbe separatedby, COI sequence data. This pattern is much more common among echinoderms than among molluscs or arthropods, and suggests that echinoderms acquire reproductive isolation at a much faster pace than other marine phyla. Understanding the causes behind such patterns will refine our understanding of diversification and biodiversity in the sea."
10.1101/014241,"Recent work has demonstrated that some functional categories of the genome contribute disproportionately to the heritability of complex diseases. Here, we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell-type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits spanning a total of 1.3 million phenotype measurements. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while controlling for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes, and leverages genome-wide information. Our results include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits; a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers; and many cell-type-specific enrichments including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment, and smoking behavior. These results demonstrate that GWAS can aid in understanding the biological basis of disease and provide direction for functional follow-up."
10.1101/014290,"Individuals within a species vary in their responses to a wide range of stimuli, partly as a result of differences in their genetic makeup. Relatively little is known about the genetic and neuronal mechanisms contributing to diversity of behavior in natural populations. By studying animal-to-animal variation in innate avoidance behavior to thermal stimuli in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered genetic principles of how different components of a behavioral response can be altered in nature to generate behavioral diversity. Using a thermal pulse assay, we uncovered heritable variation in responses to a transient temperature increase. Quantitative trait locus mapping revealed that separate components of this response were controlled by distinct genomic loci. The loci we identified contributed to variation in components of thermal pulse avoidance behavior in an additive fashion. Our results show that the escape behavior induced by thermal stimuli is composed of simpler behavioral components that are influenced by at least six distinct genetic loci. The loci that decouple components of the escape behavior reveal a genetic system that allows independent modification of behavioral parameters. Our work sets the foundation for future studies of evolution of innate behaviors at the molecular and neuronal level."
10.1101/014316,"Influencing choice behavior is key to achieving behavioral change. Traditional means to influence choice behavior rely on effortful self control, which is known to be fragile under several circumstances, rendering these methods ineffectual in maintaining any change in behavior over time. Behavioral maintenance efforts are likely more effective over the long term if they target more automatic processes such as attention or memory. Memories are not set in stone and are vulnerable to change and updating under certain circumstances when retrieved. It is possible to target specific memories for updating. In two studies, we sought to update the memory for an appetitive choice by way of reversal learning following retrieval of the targeted choice behavior. We found that targeting memories of a choice behavior for updating shortly after a reminder did not significantly attenuate the renewal of the targeted choice under extinction conditions. Possible explanations and suggested future directions are discussed."
10.1101/014217,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health emergency. Increasingly drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) continue to emerge and spread, highlighting adaptability of this pathogen. Most studies of M.tb evolution have relied on  between-host samples, in which each person with TB is represented by a single M.tb isolate. However, individuals with TB commonly harbor populations of M.tb numbering in the billions. Here, we use analyses of M.tb genomic data from within and between hosts to gain insight into influences shaping genetic diversity of this pathogen. We find that the amount of M.tb genetic diversity harbored by individuals with TB can vary dramatically, likely as a function of disease severity. Surprisingly, we did not find an appreciable impact of TB treatment on M.tb diversity. In examining genomic data from M.tb samples within and between hosts with TB, we find that genes involved in the regulation, synthesis, and transportation of immunomodulatory cell envelope lipids appear repeatedly in the extremes of various statistical measures of diversity. Many of these genes have been identified as possible targets of selection in other studies employing different methods and data sets. Taken together, these observations suggest that M.tb cell envelope lipids are targets of selection within hosts. Many of these lipids are specific to pathogenic mycobacteria and, in some cases, human-pathogenic mycobacteria. We speculate that rapid adaptation of cell envelope lipids is facilitated by functional redundancy, flexibility in their metabolism, and their roles mediating interactions with the host."
10.1101/014340,"BackgroundStudies of diversification and trait evolution increasingly rely on combining molecular sequences and fossil dates to infer time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. Available calibration software provides many options for the shape of the prior probability distribution of ages at a node to be calibrated, but the question of how to assign a Bayesian prior from limited fossil data remains open.\n\nResultsWe introduce two new methods for generating priors based upon (1) the interval between the two oldest fossils in a clade, i.e., the penultimate gap (PenG), and (2) the ghost lineage length (GLin), defined as the difference between the oldest fossils for each of two sister lineages. We show that PenG and GLin/2 are point estimates of the interval between the oldest fossil and the true age for the node. Furthermore, given either of these quantities, we derive a principled prior distribution for the true age. This prior is log-logistic, and can be implemented approximately in existing software. Using simulated data, we test these new methods against some other approaches.\n\nConclusionsWhen implemented as approaches for assigning Bayesian priors, the PenG and GLin methods increase the accuracy of inferred divergence times, showing considerably more precision than the other methods tested, without significantly greater bias. When implemented as approaches to post-hoc scaling of a tree by linear regression, the PenG and GLin methods exhibit less bias than other methods tested. The new methods are simple to use and can be applied to a variety of studies that call for calibrated trees."
10.1101/014357,"In the Evolve and Resequence method (E&R), experimental evolution and genomics are combined to investigate evolutionary dynamics and the genotype-phenotype link. This approach requires many replicates with large population sizes, which imposes severe restrictions on the analysis of behavioral phenotypes. Aiming to use E&R for investigating the evolution of behavior in Drosophila, we have developed a simple and effective method to assess spontaneous olfactory preferences and learning in large samples of fruit flies using a T-maze. We tested this procedure on (a) a large wild-caught population and (b) 11 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Compared to previous methods, this procedure reduces the environmental noise and allows for the analysis of large population samples. Consistent with previous results, we show that flies have a spontaneous preference for orange vs. apple odor. With our procedure wild-derived flies exhibit olfactory learning in the absence of previous laboratory selection. Furthermore, we find genetic differences in the olfactory learning with relatively high heritability. We propose this large-scale method as an effective tool for E&R and genome-wide association studies on olfactory preferences and learning."
10.1101/014399,"While most current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies generate short reads with low error rates, emerging sequencing technologies generate long reads with high error rates. A basic question of interest is the tradeoff between read length and error rate in terms of the information needed for the perfect assembly of the genome. Using an adversarial erasure error model, we make progress on this problem by establishing a critical read length, as a function of the genome and the error rate, above which perfect assembly is guaranteed. For several real genomes, including those from the GAGE dataset, we verify that this critical read length is not significantly greater than the read length required for perfect assembly from reads without errors."
10.1101/014381,"Transcription factors (TFs) play multiple roles in different cells and stages of development. Given this multitude of functional roles it has been assumed that TFs are evolutionarily highly constrained. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms for the origin of a derived functional interaction between two TFs that play a key role in mammalian pregnancy, HOXA11 and FOXO1. We have previously shown that the regulatory role of HOXA11 in mammalian endometrial stromal cells requires an interaction with FOXO1, and that the physical interaction between these proteins evolved long before their functional cooperativity. Through a combination of functional, biochemical, and structural approaches, we demonstrate that the derived functional cooperativity between HOXA11 and FOXO1 is due to derived allosteric regulation of HOXA11 by FOXO1. This study shows that TF function can evolve through changes affecting the functional output of a pre-existing protein complex."
10.1101/014415,"Feral livestock may harbor genetic variation of commercial, scientific, historical or esthetic value. Origins and uniqueness of feral cattle on Chirikof Island, Alaska are uncertain. The island is now part of the Alaska Maritime Wildlife Refuge and Federal wildlife managers want grazing to cease, presumably leading to demise of the cattle. Here we characterize the Chirikof Island cattle relative to extant breeds and discern their origins. Our analyses support the inference that Russian cattle arrived first on Chirikof Island, then approximately 120 years ago the first European taurine cattle were introduced to the island, and finally a large wave of Hereford cattle were introduced on average 40 years ago. While clearly Bos taurus taurus, the Chirikof Island cattle appear at least as distinct as other recognized breeds. Further, this mixture of European and East-Asian cattle is unique compared to other North American breeds and we find evidence that natural selection in the relatively harsh environment of Chirikof Island has further impacted their genetic architecture. These results provide an objective basis for decisions regarding conservation of the Chirikof Island cattle."
10.1101/014407,"During the last two decades ferrets (Mustela putorius) have been established as a highly efficient animal model in different fields in neuroscience. Here we asked whether ferrets integrate sensory information according to the same principles established for other species. Since only few methods and protocols are available for behaving ferrets we developed a head-free, body-restrained approach allowing a standardized stimulation position and the utilization of the ferrets natural response behavior. We established a behavioral paradigm to test audiovisual integration in the ferret. Animals had to detect a brief auditory and/or visual stimulus presented either left or right from their midline. We first determined detection thresholds for auditory amplitude and visual contrast. In a second step, we combined both modalities and compared psychometric fits and the reaction times between all conditions. We employed Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to model bimodal psychometric curves and to investigate whether ferrets integrate modalities in an optimal manner. Furthermore, to test for a redundant signal effect we pooled the reaction times of all animals to calculate a race model. We observed that bimodal detection thresholds were reduced and reaction times were faster in the bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. The race model and MLE modeling showed that ferrets integrate modalities in a statistically optimal fashion. Taken together, the data indicate that principles of multisensory integration previously demonstrated in other species also apply to crossmodal processing in the ferret."
10.1101/014373,"In the absence of sensory stimulation or motor output, the brain exhibits complex spatiotemporal patterns of intrinsically generated neural activity. However, little is known about how such patterns of activity are correlated between cortical and subcortical brain areas. Here, we investigate the large-scale correlation structure of ongoing cortical and superior colliculus (SC) activity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Cortico-tectal interaction was characterized by correlated fluctuations in the amplitude of delta, spindle, low gamma and high frequency oscillations (> 100 Hz). Of these identified coupling modes, topographical patterns of high frequency coupling were the most consistent with anatomical connectivity, and reflected synchronized spiking in cortico-tectal networks. Ongoing high frequency cortico-tectal coupling was temporally governed by the phase of slow cortical oscillations. Collectively, our findings show that cortico-tectal networks can be resolved through the correlation structure of ongoing neural activity, and demonstrate the rich information conveyed by high frequency electrocorticographic signals."

The pivotal role of the efferent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in controlling inflammation has been described in adults, but its importance in the fetus is unknown. Moreover, it is unknown whether CAP may also exert anti-inflammatory effects on the brain via CAPs afferent component of the vagus nerve. Based on multiple clinical studies in adults and our own work in fetal autonomic nervous system, we gauged the degree of CAP activity in vivo using heart rate variability measures reflecting fluctuations in vagus nerve activity. Measuring microglial activation in the ovine fetal brain near-term, we show in vivo that afferent fetal CAP may translate increased vagal cholinergic signaling into suppression of cerebral inflammation in response to near-term hypoxic acidemia as might occur during labour. Our findings suggest a new control mechanism of fetal neuroinflammation via the vagus nerve, providing novel possibilities for its non-invasive monitoring in utero and for targeted treatment."
10.1101/014365,"BackgroundVisualization and analysis of molecular profiling data together with biological networks are able to provide new mechanistical insights into biological functions. Currently, high-throughput data are usually visualized on top of predefined network layouts which are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. We developed a Cytoscape app which allows to construct biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of nodes attributes.\n\nResultsDeDaL is a Cytoscape 3.0 app which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. Combining these possibilities facilitates creating insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and the correlation patterns in multivariate data.\n\nConclusionsDeDaL is the first method allowing to construct biological network layouts from high-throughput data.

10.1101/014472,"SummaryCell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general framework composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. Sincell functionalities are illustrated in a real case study where its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies is demonstrated.\n\nAvailability and implementationSincell is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.1/bioc/html/sincell.html.

10.1101/014449,"We present a population density and moment-based description of the stochastic dynamics of domain Ca2+-mediated inactivation of L-type Ca2+ channels. Our approach accounts for the effect of heterogeneity of local Ca2+ signals on whole cell Ca2+ currents; however, in contrast with prior work, e.g., Sherman et al. (1990), we do not assume that Ca2+ domain formation and collapse are fast compared to channel gating. We demonstrate the population density and moment-based modeling approaches using a 12-state Markov chain model of an L-type Ca2+ channel introduced by Greenstein and Winslow (2002). Simulated whole cell voltage clamp responses yield an inactivation function for the whole cell Ca2+ current that agrees with the traditional approach when domain dynamics are fast. We analyze the voltage-dependence of Ca2+ inactivation that may occur via slow heterogeneous domains. Next, we find that when channel permeability is held constant, Ca2+-mediated inactivation of L-type channel increases as the domain time constant increases, because a slow domain collapse rate leads to increased mean domain [Ca2+] near open channels; conversely, when the maximum domain [Ca2+] is held constant, inactivation decreases as the domain time constant increases. Comparison of simulation results using population densities and moment equations confirms the computational efficiency of the moment-based approach, and enables the validation of two distinct methods of truncating and closing the open system of moment equations. In general, a slow domain time constant requires higher order moment truncation for agreement between moment-based and population density simulations."
10.1101/014431,"Through theoretical analysis of the statistics of stochastic calcium (Ca2+) release (i.e., the amplitude, duration and inter-event interval of simulated Ca2+ puffs and sparks), we show that a Langevin description of the collective gating of Ca2+ channels may be a good approximation to the corresponding Markov chain model when the number of Ca2+ channels per Ca2+ release unit (CaRU) is in the physiological range. The Langevin description of stochastic Ca2+ release facilitates our investigation of correlations between successive puff/spark amplitudes, durations and inter-spark intervals, and how such puff/spark statistics depend on the number of channels per release site and the kinetics of Ca2+-mediated inactivation of open channels. When Ca2+ inactivation/de-inactivation rates are intermediate--i.e., the termination of Ca2+ puff/sparks is caused by the recruitment of inactivated channels--the correlation between successive puff/spark amplitudes is negative, while the correlations between puff/spark amplitudes and the duration of the preceding or subsequent inter-spark interval are positive. These correlations are significantly reduced when inactivation/deinactivation rates are extreme (slow or fast) and puff/sparks terminate via stochastic attrition."
10.1101/014456,"Little is known about the role of immigration in shaping bacterial communities or the factors that may dictate success or failure of colonization by bacteria from regional species pools. To address these knowledge gaps, the influence of bacterial colonization into an ecosystem (activated sludge bioreactor) was measured through a disturbance gradient (successive decreases in the parameter solids retention time) relative to stable operational conditions. Through a DNA sequencing approach, we show that the most abundant bacteria within the immigrant community have a greater probability of colonizing the receiving ecosystem, but mostly as low abundance community members. Only during the disturbance do some of these bacterial populations significantly increase in abundance beyond background levels and in few cases become dominant community members post-disturbance. Two mechanisms facilitate the enhanced enrichment of immigrant populations during disturbance: 1) the availability of resources left unconsumed by established species and 2) the increased availability of niche space for colonizers to establish and displace resident populations. Thus, as a disturbance decreases local diversity, recruitment sites become available to promote colonization. This work advances our understanding of microbial resource management and diversity maintenance in complex ecosystems."
10.1101/014480,"The Ebola epidemic is having a devastating impact in West Africa. Sequencing of Ebola viruses from infected individuals has revealed extensive genetic variation, leading to speculation that the virus may be adapting to the human host and accounting for the scale of the 2014 outbreak. We show that so far there is no evidence for adaptation of EBOV to humans. We analyze the putatively functional changes associated with the current and previous Ebola outbreaks, and find no significant molecular changes. Observed amino acid replacements have minimal effect on protein structure, being neither stabilizing nor destabilizing. Replacements are not found in regions of the proteins associated with known functions and tend to occur in disordered regions. This observation indicates that the difference between the current and previous outbreaks is not due to the observed evolutionary change of the virus. Instead, epidemiological factors must be responsible for the unprecedented spread of EBOV."
10.1101/014464,"The genetic basis of species differences remains understudied. Studies in insects have contributed significantly to our understanding of morphological evolution. Pigmentation traits in particular have received a great deal of attention and several genes in the insect pigmentation pathway have been implicated in inter- and intraspecific differences. Nonetheless, much remains unknown about many of the genes in this pathway and their potential role in understudied taxa. Here we genetically analyze the puparium color difference between members of the Virilis group of Drosophila. The puparium of Drosophila virilis is black, while those of D. americana, D. novamexicana, and D. lummei are brown. We used a series of backcross hybrid populations between D. americana and D. virilis to map the genomic interval responsible for the difference between this species pair. First, we show that the pupal case color difference is caused by a single Mendelizing factor, which we ultimately map to an ~11kb region on chromosome 5. The mapped interval includes only the first exon and regulatory region(s) of the dopamine N-acetyltransferase gene (Dat). This gene encodes an enzyme that is known to play a part in the insect pigmentation pathway. Second, we show that this gene is highly expressed at the onset of pupation in light-brown taxa (D. americana and D. novamexicana) relative to D. virilis, but not in the dark-brown D. lummei. Finally, we examine the role of Dat in adult pigmentation between D. americana (heavily melanized) and D. novamexicana (lightly melanized) and find no discernible effect of this gene in adults. Our results demonstrate that a single gene is entirely or almost entirely responsible for a morphological difference between species."
10.1101/014498,"Identifying genetic correlations between complex traits and diseases can provide useful etiological insights and help prioritize likely causal relationships. The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use our method to estimate 300 genetic correlations among 25 traits, totaling more than 1.5 million unique phenotype measurements. Our results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity and associations between educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, since there currently are no genome-wide significant SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment."
10.1101/014514,"BackgroundHigh frequency oscillations in the gamma range are known to be involved in early stages of auditory information processing in terms of synchronization of brain regions, e.g., in cognitive functions. It has been shown using EEG source localisation, as well as simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI, that the auditory evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) is modulated by attention. In addition to auditory cortex activity a dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) generator could be involved. In the present study we investigated aeGBR magnetic fields using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We aimed to localize the aeGBR sources and its connectivity features in relation to mental effort.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the aeGBR magnetic fields in 13 healthy participants using a 275-channel CTF-MEG system. The experimental paradigms were two auditory choice reaction tasks with different difficulties and demands for mental effort. We performed source localization with eLORETA and calculated the aeGBR lagged phase synchronization between bilateral auditory cortices and frontal midline structures.\n\nResultsThe eLORETA analysis revealed sources of the aeGBR within bilateral auditory cortices and in frontal midline structures of the brain including the dACC. Compared to the control condition the dACC source activity was found to be significantly stronger during the performance of the cognitively demanding task. Moreover, this task involved a significantly stronger functional connectivity between auditory cortices and dACC.\n\nConclusionIn accordance with previous EEG and EEG-fMRI investigations, our study confirms an aeGBR generator in the dACC by means of MEG and suggests its involvement in the effortful processing of auditory stimuli."
10.1101/014423,"The integration of sensory signals from different modalities requires flexible interaction of remote brain areas. One candidate mechanism to establish communication in the brain is transient synchronization of oscillatory neural signals. Although there is abundant evidence for the involvement of cortical oscillations in brain functions based on the analysis of local power, assessment of the phase dynamics among spatially distributed neuronal populations and their relevance for behavior is still sparse. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between remote brain areas by analyzing high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained from human participants engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching task. We deployed an approach for purely data-driven clustering of neuronal phase coupling in source space, which allowed imaging of large-scale functional networks in space, time and frequency without defining a priori constraints. Based on the phase coupling results, we further explored how brain areas interacted across frequencies by computing phase-amplitude coupling. Several networks of interacting sources were identified with our approach, synchronizing their activity within and across the theta (~5 Hz), alpha (~10 Hz), and beta (~ 20 Hz) frequency bands and involving multiple brain areas that have previously been associated with attention and motor control. We demonstrate the functional relevance of these networks by showing that phase delays - in contrast to spectral power - were predictive of task performance. The data-driven analysis approach employed in the current study allowed an unbiased examination of functional brain networks based on EEG source level connectivity data. Showcased for multisensory processing, our results provide evidence that large-scale neuronal coupling is vital to long-range communication in the human brain and relevant for the behavioral outcome in a cognitive task."
10.1101/014324,"1AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWN-terminal acetylation (NTA) is one of the most abundant protein modifications known, and the N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) machinery is conserved throughout all Eukarya. Over the past 50 years, the function of NTA has begun to be slowly elucidated, and this includes the modulation of protein-protein interaction, protein-stability, protein function, and protein targeting to specific cellular compartments. Many of these functions have been studied in the context of Naa10/NatA; however, we are only starting to really understand the full complexity of this picture. Roughly, about 40 % of all human proteins are substrates of Naa10 and the impact of this modification has only been studied for a few of them. Besides acting as a NAT in the NatA complex, recently other functions have been linked to Naa10, including post-translational NTA, lysine acetylation, and NAT/KAT-independent functions. Also, recent publications have linked mutations in Naa10 to various diseases, emphasizing the importance of Naa10 research in humans. The recent design and synthesis of the first bisubstrate inhibitors that potently and selectively inhibit the NatA/Naa10 complex, monomeric Naa10, and hNaa50 further increases the toolset to analyze Naa10 function."
10.1101/014530,"Epidemiological observations and molecular-level experiments have indicated that brain disorders in the realm of psychiatry may be influenced by immune dysregulation. However, the degree of genetic overlap between immune disorders and psychiatric disorders has not been well established. We investigated this issue by integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 18 complex human traits/diseases (five psychiatric disorders, seven autoimmune disorders, and others) and multiple genomewide annotation resources (Central nervous system genes, immune-related expressionquantitative trait loci (eQTL) and DNase I hypertensive sites from 98 cell-lines). We detected pleiotropy in 24 of the 35 psychiatric-autoimmune disorder pairs, with statistical significance as strong as p=3.9e-285 (schizophrenia-rheumatoid arthritis). Strong enrichment (>1.4 fold) of immune-related eQTL was observed in four psychiatric disorders. Genomic regions responsible for pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and autoimmune disorders were detected. The MHC region on chromosome 6 appears to be the most important (and it was indeed previously noted (1-3) as a confluence between schizophrenia and immune disorder risk regions), with many other regions, such as cytoband 1p13.2. We also found that most alleles shared between schizophrenia and Crohns disease have the same effect direction, with similar trend found for other disorder pairs, such as bipolar-Crohns disease. Our results offer a novel birds-eye view of the genetic relationship and demonstrate strong evidence for mediated pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and autoimmune disorders. Our findings might open new routes for prevention and treatment strategies for these disorders based on a new appreciation of the importance of immunological mechanisms in mediating risk."
10.1101/014522,"Piwi-interacting piRNAs are a major and essential class of small RNAs in the animal germ cells with a prominent role in transposon control. Efficient piRNA biogenesis and function require a cohort of proteins conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Here we studied Maelstrom (MAEL), which is essential for piRNA biogenesis and germ cell differentiation in flies and mice. MAEL contains a high mobility group (HMG)-box domain and a Maelstrom-specific domain with a presumptive RNase H-fold. We employed a combination of sequence analyses, structural and biochemical approaches to evaluate and compare nucleic acid binding of mouse MAEL HMG-box to that of canonical HMG-box domain proteins (SRY and HMGB1a). MAEL HMG-box failed to bind double-stranded (ds)DNA but bound to structured RNA. We also identified important roles of a novel cluster of arginine residues in MAEL HMG-box in these interactions. Cumulatively, our results suggest that the MAEL HMG-box domain may contribute to MAEL function in selective processing of retrotransposon RNA into piRNAs. In this regard, a cellular role of MAEL HMG-box domain is reminiscent of that of HMGB1 as a sentinel of immunogenic nucleic acids in the innate immune response."
10.1101/014548,"A large amount of studies of the last decades revealed an association between human behaviour and oscillatory activity in the human brain. Alike, abnormalities of oscillatory activity were related with pathological behaviour in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as in Parkinsons disease (PD) or in schizophrenia (SCZ). As a therapeutic tool, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has demonstrated the potential to improve behavioural performance in patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. Since evidence accumulates that NIBS might be able to modulate oscillatory activity and related behaviour in a scientific setting, this review focuses on discussing potential interventional strategies to target abnormalities in oscillatory activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we will review oscillatory changes described in patients after stroke, with PD or suffering from SCZ. Potential ways of targeting interventionally the underlying pathological oscillations to improve related pathological behaviour will be further discussed."
10.1101/014589,"Cancer poses danger because of its unregulated growth, development of resistant subclones, and metastatic spread to vital organs. Although the major transitions in cancer development are increasingly well understood, we lack quantitative theory for how preventive measures and post-excision (reactive) treatments are predicted to affect risks of obtaining a life threatening cancer or relapse, respectively. We employ analytical and numerical models to evaluate how continuous measures such as life style changes, and certain non-targeted and targeted treatments affect both neoplastic growth and the frequency of resistant clones. We find that preventive measures can have a negligible impact on pre-cancerous lesions and yet achieve considerable reductions in risk of invasive cancer. Importantly, our model, based on realistic parameter estimates, predicts that daily cancer cell arrest levels of 0.2-0.3% produce optimal outcomes for prevention, whereas for reaction the level is 0.3-0.4%. For similar cancer cell populations, prevention outcomes are, on average, always better than reactive ones. This is because reactive measures are more likely to select for faster growing subclones with higher probabilities of resistance, highlighting the difficulty in countering relapse regardless of therapeutic impact on cancer cell populations. We discuss these results and other important mitigating factors that need to be taken into consideration in a comparative understanding of preventive versus reactive treatments."
10.1101/014571,"This article discusses problems with and solutions to performing valid permutation tests for quantitative trait loci in the presence of polygenic effects. Although permutation testing is a popular approach for determining statistical significance of a test statistic with an unknown distribution-for instance, the maximum of multiple correlated statistics or some omnibus test statistic for a gene, gene-set or pathway-naive application of permutations may result in an invalid test. The risk of performing an invalid permutation test is particularly acute in complex trait mapping where polygenicity may combine with a structured population resulting from the presence of families, cryptic relatedness, admixture or population stratification. I give both analytical derivations and a conceptual understanding of why typical permutation procedures fail and suggest an alternative permutation based algorithm, MVNpermute, that succeeds. In particular, I examine the case where a linear mixed model is used to analyze a quantitative trait and show that both phenotype and genotype permutations may result in an invalid permutation test. I provide a formula that predicts the amount of inflation of the type 1 error rate depending on the degree of misspecification of the covariance structure of the polygenic effect and the heritability of the trait. I validate this formula by doing simulations, showing that the permutation distribution matches the theoretical expectation, and that my suggested permutation based test obtains the correct null distribution. Finally, I discuss situations where naive permutations of the phenotype or genotype are valid and the applicability of the results to other test statistics."
10.1101/014563,"Schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive and autistic disorders are traditionally considered as three separate psychiatric conditions each with specific symptoms and pattern of brain alterations. This view can be challenged since these three conditions have the same neurobiological origin, stemming from a common root of a unique neurodevelopmental tree.\n\nThe aim of this meta-analytic study was to determine, from a neuroimaging perspective, whether i) white matter and gray matter alterations are specific for the three different spectrum disorders, and the nosographical differentiation of three spectra is supported by different patterns of brain alterations. ii) it might be possible to define new spectra starting from specific brain damage. iii) it is possible to detect a \""brain damage network\"" (a connecting link between the damaged areas that relates areas constantly involved in the disorder).\n\nThree main findings emerged from our meta-analysis: O_LIThe three psychiatric spectra do not appear to have their own specific damage.\nC_LIO_LIIt is possible to define two new damage clusters. The first includes substantial parts of the salience network, and the second is more closely linked to the auditory-visual, auditory and visual somatic areas.\nC_LIO_LIIt is possible to define a \""Damage Network\"" and to infer a hierarchy of brain substrates in the pattern of propagation of the damage.\nC_LI\n\nThese results suggest the presence of a common pattern of damage in the three pathologies plus a series of variable alterations that, rather than support the sub-division into three spectra, highlight a two-cluster parcellation with an input-output and more cognitive clusters."
10.1101/014605,"An enduring challenge in ecology is to understand how diverse plant species coexist when competing for the same basic resources1-4. Two candidate frameworks for meeting this challenge currently exist in forest ecology. Niche-based approaches succeed in describing successional dynamics in response to recurrent disturbances5-9. Approaches based on Hubbells neutral theory describe abundance patterns in highly diverse communities10. Yet both theories are unsuccessful where their competitor is strong, highlighting an enduring need for reconciliation11-13. In fact, the perception that niche and neutral processes are incompatible may have arisen because both types of models have lacked some critical features of real forests. Here we report a productive reconciliation that arises from extending niche models to include three ubiquitous features of vegetation: (1) plant growth under light competition, (2) multiple trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function, and (3) evolutionary community assembly. We show that fitness equivalence - which neutral theory controversially takes as an assumption4,1213-14 - naturally arises as a mechanistic outcome of niche differentiation, but only within a specific region of trait space, corresponding to shade-tolerant later-successional strategies. In this way, niche diversification can lead, via evolved neutrality, to a proliferation of shade-tolerant strategies, one of the phenomena that motivated the development of neutral theory12. Earlier niche models focussed on a single growth-mortality trait and found no evolved neutrality. In contrast, the model introduced here includes a second trait, height at maturation, in addition to a growth-mortality trait in the form of leaf-construction cost. We show that fitness equivalence only emerges when diversifications include this second trait. We also demonstrate that our extended niche model generates markedly different forest types under different environmental conditions, recovering known biogeographic patterns15-18. By evolving forests from first principles, our study constructively resolves the protracted debate about niche versus neutral dynamics for forest communities, and provides a platform for a synthetic theory of forest structure and diversity."
10.1101/014613,"AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPWe present an exon-capture system for an entire class of marine invertebrates, the Ophiuroidea, built upon a phylogenetically diverse transcriptome foundation. The system captures ~90 percent of the 1552 exon target, across all major lineages of the quarter-billion year old extant crown group. Key features of our system are: 1) basing the target on an alignment of orthologous genes determined from 52 transcriptomes spanning the phylogenetic diversity and trimmed to remove anything difficult to capture, map or align, 2) use of multiple artificial representatives based on ancestral states rather than exemplars to improve capture and mapping of the target, 3) mapping reads to a multi-reference alignment, and 4) using patterns of site polymorphism to distinguish among paralogy, polyploidy, allelic differences and sample contamination. The resulting data gives a well-resolved tree (currently standing at 417 samples, 275,352 bp, 91% data-complete) that will transform our understanding of ophiuroid evolution and biogeography."
10.1101/013730,"Sleep and circadian rhythms are ancient, related phenomena controlled by distinct circuitry, whose appropriate regulation is critical to health. The regulatory machinery underlying sleep homeostasis is ill-defined, but biological clock mechanisms are better understood: from  clock gene oscillations to rest/activity cycles. Age- and neurodegeneration-related deterioration in sleep/wake timing was first described in humans decades ago, and has recently been recapitulated in model organisms. To delineate causal relationships between aging, sleep, neuronal function and the molecular clockwork, we developed FLYGLOW, a bioluminescence-based system which allows rest/activity, sleep consolidation and molecular rhythms to be quantified simultaneously in many individual flies over days/weeks. FLYGLOW outperforms existing methods, and allows multiparameter correlational analyses within and between flies. We also show unambiguously that peripheral tissue rhythms free-run independently of the central pacemakers driving behavioural cycles. Using an Alzheimers fly model we observe a profound disorganization of sleep/wake cycles, phenocopying the human disease."
10.1101/014662,"Analysis of High-throughput sequencing (HTS) data is a difficult problem, especially in the context of non-model organisms where comparison of homologous sequences may be hindered by the lack of a close reference genome. Current mapping-based methods rely on the availability of a highly similar reference sequence, whereas de novo assemblies produce anonymous (unannotated) contigs that are not easily compared across samples. Here, we present Assembly by Reduced Complexity (ARC) a hybrid mapping and assembly approach for targeted assembly of homologous sequences. ARC is an open-source project (http://ibest.github.io/ARC/) implemented in the Python language and consists of the following stages: 1) align sequence reads to reference targets, 2) use alignment results to distribute reads into target specific bins, 3) perform assemblies for each bin (target) to produce contigs, and 4) replace previous reference targets with assembled contigs and iterate. We show that ARC is able to assemble high quality, unbiased mitochondrial genomes seeded from 11 progressively divergent references, and is able to assemble full mitochondrial genomes starting from short, poor quality ancient DNA reads. We also show ARC compares favorably to de novo assembly of a large exome capture dataset for CPU and memory requirements; assembling 7,627 individual targets across 55 samples, completing over 1.3 million assemblies in less than 78 hours, while using under 32 Gb of system memory. ARC breaks the assembly problem down into many smaller problems, solving the anonymous contig and poor scaling inherent in some de novo assembly methods and reference bias inherent in traditional read mapping."
10.1101/014654,"MotivationProtein database search is one of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. For decades, it has been explored and solved using different exact and heuristic approaches. However, exponential growth of data in size in recent years has brought significant challenges in improving already existing algorithms. BLASTP has been the most successful tool for protein database search, but is also becoming a bottleneck in many applications. Due to that, many different approaches have been developed to comple-ment or replace BLASTP. In this paper, we present SWORD, an efficient protein database search implementation that runs 3-4 faster than BLASTP in the sensitive mode and up to 18 faster in the fast and less accurate mode and also provides guaranteed optimal alignments for candidate sequences. SWORD is designed to be used in nearly all database search environments, but is especially suitable for large databases. Its sensitivity exceeds that of BLASTP for majority of input datasets.\n\nAvailabilitySword is freely available for download from https://github.com/rvaser/sword\n\nContactrobert.vaser@fer.hr, mile.sikic@fer.hr"
10.1101/014704,"Transport of cells and biochemical molecules often takes place in crowded, heterogeneous environments. As such, it is important we understand how to quantify crowded transport phenomena, and the possibilities of extracting transport coefficients from limited observations. We employ a volume-excluding random walk model on a square lattice where different fractions of lattice sites are filled with inert, immobile obstacles to investigate whether it is possible to estimate parameters associated with transport when crowding is present. By collecting and analysing data obtained on multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that commonly used models of motility within crowded environments can be used to reliably predict our random walk data. However, infeasibly large amounts of data are needed to estimate transport parameters, and quantitative estimates may differ depending on the spatial scale on which they are collected. We also demonstrate that in models of crowded environments there is a relatively large region of the parameter space within which it is difficult to distinguish between the \""best fit\"" parameter values. This suggests commonly used descriptions of transport within crowded systems may not be appropriate, and that we should be careful in choosing models to represent the effects of crowding upon motility within biochemical systems."
10.1101/014688,"We modelled the resilience and transient dynamics of terrestrial paleocommunities from the Karoo Basin, South Africa, around the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. Using recently refined biostratigraphic data that suggest two pulses of extinction leading up to the Permian-Triassic boundary, we show that during times of low extinction, paleocommunities were no more stable than randomly assembled communities, but they became stable during the mass extinction. Modelled food webs before and after the mass extinction have lower resilience and less stable transient dynamics compared to random food webs lacking in functional structure but of equal species richness. They are, however, more stable than random food webs of equal richness but with randomized functional structure. In contrast, models become increasingly more resilient and have more stable transient dynamics, relative to the random models, as the mass extinction progressed. The increased stability of the community that resulted from the first pulse of extinction was driven by significant selective extinction against small-bodied amniotes, and significantly greater probabilities of survival of large-bodied amniotes. These results point to a positive relationship between evolved patterns of functional diversity and emergent community dynamics, with observed patterns being more stable than alternative possibilities.\n\nSignificanceAnthropogenic impacts on modern ecosystems have no precedents in human history. The fossil record does contain episodes of severe biodiversity crises, but incomplete preservation and low temporal resolution make it difficult to equate fossil data to modern ecological processes. We examined terrestrial paleocommunities from Earths most severe mass extinction, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME), and modelled their dynamic stabilities. We show that during times of low extinction, paleocommunities were no more stable than randomly assembled communities, but they became more stable during the mass extinction. Increased stability resulted mostly from selective extinction and survival based on vertebrate body size. Whether modern communities will behave similarly depends on the similarity between human drivers and those of the PTME."
10.1101/014639,"Advances in empirical population genetics have made apparent the need for models that simultaneously account for selection and demography. To address this need, we here study the Wright-Fisher diffusion under selection and variable effective population size. In the case of genic selection and piecewise-constant effective population sizes, we obtain the transition density function by extending a recently developed method for computing an accurate spectral representation for a constant population size. Utilizing this extension, we show how to compute the sample frequency spectrum (SFS) in the presence of genic selection and an arbitrary number of instantaneous changes in the effective population size. We also develop an alternate, efficient algorithm for computing the SFS using a method of moments. We apply these methods to answer the following questions: If neutrality is incorrectly assumed when there is selection, what effects does it have on demographic parameter estimation? Can the impact of negative selection be observed in populations that undergo strong exponential growth?"
10.1101/014738,"Advances in electron cryomicroscopy allow for the building of de novo atomic models into high resolution Coulomb potential maps. While established validation metrics independently assess map quality and model geometry, methods to assess the precise fitting of an atomic model into the map and to validate the interpretation of high resolution features are less well developed. Here, we present EMRinger, which tests model-to-map agreement using side-chain dihedral-directed map density measurements. These measurements reveal local map density peaks and show that peaks located at rotameric angles are a sensitive marker of whether the backbone is correctly positioned. The EMRinger Score can be improved by model refinement, suggesting its utility as an effective model-to-map validation metric. Additionally, EMRinger sampling identifies how radiation damage alters scattering from negatively charged amino acids during data collection. EMRinger will be useful in assessing how advances in cryo-EM increase the ability to resolve and model high-resolution features."

10.1101/014779,"SummaryWe have previously examined the impact of neonicotinoid pesticides, dinotefuran and clothianidin, on honeybee Apis mellifera colonies in long-term field experiments when they were simultaneously administered through both vehicles of sugar syrup and pollen paste (Yamada et al., 2012). The independent effect of a pesticide through two vehicles has not been studied in our previous work. In this paper, we investigated the independent impact of dinotefuran through each of the two vehicles. We confirmed that dinotefuran intake per bee until colony extinction due to administration through pollen paste (DF-TIPP) was roughly one-fifth as much as that through sugar syrup (DF-TISS). The intake was largely independent of dinotefuran concentration. We considered the possibility of DF-TIPP per bee as an indicator to assess the impact of persistent pesticide on a honeybee colony in a practical apiary.\n\nThis work has replicated the finding that a honeybee colony has dwindled away to nothing after assuming an aspect of a colony collapse disorder (CCD) by administration of the neonicotinoids dinotefuran and clothianidin in our previous work, regardless of the vehicles. In addition, a failure in wintering was observed in case of administration of dinotefuran with the lowest concentration in this work even if the colony appeared vigorous before winter.\n\nWe can infer that a CCD and a failure in wintering may have the same roots of chronic toxicity of neonicotinoids under conditions of low concentrations due to the persistency and high toxicity which are characteristic of them."
10.1101/014795,"SummaryNeonicotinoides are persistent and highly toxic pesticides that have become popular instead of organophosphates, being suspected to be a trigger of massive disappearance of bees that raises concern in the world. The evaluation of the long-term influence for a whole colony in the natural environment is, however, not established yet. In this paper, we conducted a long-term field experiment and found different impacts on honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera) in an apiary between the neonicotinoid dinotefuran and the organophosphate fenitrothion even though whose concentrations in sugar syrup provided for bees were adjusted to have nearly equal short-term effects on a honeybee based on the median lethal dose (LD50) as well as the insecticidal activity to exterminate stinkbugs.\n\nThe colony with administration of dinotefran (dinotefuran colony) became extinct in 26 days, while the colony with administration of fenitrothion (fenitrothion colony) survived the administration for the same period. Furthermore, the fenitrothion colony succeeded to be alive for more than 293 days after administration, and also succeeded an overwintering, which indicates that colonies exposed to fenitrothion can recover after the exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, the dinotefuran colony became extinct even though the intake of dinotefuran was estimated to be comparable with that of fenitrothion in terms of the LD50 of a honeybee. Moreover, the colonies in our previous long-term experiments where dinotefuran with higher concentration were administered only for first few days (Yamada et al., 2012) became extinct in 104 days and 162 days, respectively. From these results, we speculate that colonies exposed to dinotefuran hardly recover from the damage because dinotefuran is much more persistent than fenitrothion and toxic foods stored in cells can affect a colony in a long period."
10.1101/014811,"Island endemics are likely to experience population bottlenecks; they also have restricted ranges. Therefore we expect island species to have small effective population sizes (Ne) and reduced genetic diversity compared to their mainland counterparts. As a consequence, island species may have inefficient selection and reduced adaptive potential. We used both polymorphisms and substitutions to address these predictions, improving on the approach of recent studies that only used substitution data. This allowed us to directly test the assumption that island species have small values of Ne. We found that island species had significantly less genetic diversity than mainland species; however, this pattern could be attributed to a subset of island species that had undergone a recent population bottleneck. When these species were excluded from the analysis, island and mainland species had similar levels of genetic diversity, despite island species occupying considerably smaller areas than their mainland counterparts. We also found no overall difference between island and mainland species in terms of effectiveness of selection or mutation rate. Our evidence suggests that island colonisation has no lasting impact on molecular evolution. This surprising result highlights gaps in our knowledge of the relationship between census and effective population size."
10.1101/014845,"Degradation of mRNA contributes to variation in transcript abundance. Studies of individual mRNAs show that cis and trans factors control mRNA degradation rates. However, transcriptome-wide studies have failed to identify global relationships between transcript properties and mRNA degradation. We investigated the contribution of cis and trans factors to transcriptome-wide degradation rate variation in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using multiple regression analysis. We find that multiple transcript properties are associated with mRNA degradation rates and that a model incorporating these factors explains [~]50% of the genome-wide variance. Predictors of mRNA degradation rates include transcript length, abundance, ribosome density, codon adaptation index (CAI) and GC content of the third position in codons. To validate these factors we studied individual transcripts expressed from identical promoters. We find that decreasing ribosome density by mutating the translational start site of the GAP1 transcript increases its degradation rate. Using variants of GFP that differ at synonymous sites, we show that increased GC content of the third position of codons results in decreased mRNA degradation rate. Thus, in steady-state conditions, a large fraction of genome-wide variation in mRNA degradation rates is determined by inherent properties of transcripts related to protein translation rather than specific regulatory mechanisms."
10.1101/014787,"Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually, interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins are faced by all living cells and construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modelling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine."
10.1101/014852,"Increased dispersal propensity often evolves on expanding range edges due to the Olympic Village effect, which involves the fastest and fittest finding themselves together in the same place at the same time, mating, and giving rise to like individuals. But what happens after the ranges leading edge has passed and the games are over? Although empirical studies indicate that dispersal propensity attenuates following range expansion, hypotheses about the mechanisms driving this attenuation have not been clearly articulated or tested. Here we use a simple model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of two phenotypes, one fast and the other slow, to propose that dispersal attenuation beyond pre-expansion levels is only possible in the presence of trade-offs between dispersal and life-history traits. The Olympic Village effect ensures that fast dispersers pre-empt locations far from the ranges previous limits. When trade-offs are absent, this pre-emptive spatial advantage has a lasting impact, with highly dispersive individuals attaining equilibrium frequencies that are strictly higher than their introduction frequencies. When trade-offs are present, dispersal propensity decays rapidly at all locations. Our models results about the post-colonization trajectory of dispersal evolution are clear and, in principle, should be observable in field studies. We conclude that empirical observations of post-colonization dispersal attenuation offer a novel way to detect the existence of otherwise elusive trade-offs between dispersal and life-history traits."
10.1101/014829,Epistasis is a key concept in the theory of adaptation. Indicators of epistasis are of interest for large system where systematic fitness measurements may not be possible. Some recent approaches depend on information theory. We show that considering shared entropy for pairs of loci can be misleading. The reason is that shared entropy does not imply epistasis for the pair. This observation holds true also in the absence of higher order epistasis. We discuss a refined approach for identifying pairwise interactions using entropy.
10.1101/014837,"North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster are thought to derive from both European and African source populations, but despite their importance for genetic research, patterns of admixture along their genomes are essentially undocumented. Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20% for the DGRP and 9% for the reference genome. Based on the size of admixture tracts and the approximate timing of admixture, I estimate that the DGRP population underwent roughly 13.9 generations per year. Notably, ancestry levels varied strikingly among genomic regions, with significantly less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes such as circadian rhythm. An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by a genome-wide signal of ancestry disequilibrium, in that many between-chromosome pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa-Europe allele combinations. These results support the hypothesis that admixture between partially genetically isolated Drosophila populations led to natural selection against incompatible genetic variants, and that this process is ongoing. The ancestry blocks inferred here may be relevant for the performance of reference alignment in this species, and may bolster the design and interpretation of many population genetic and association mapping studies."
10.1101/014647,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA common belief among human life history researchers is that \""harsher\"" environments - i.e., those with higher mortality rates and resource stress - select for \""fast\"" life histories, i.e. earlier reproduction and faster senescence. I show that these \""harsh environments, fast life histories\"" - or HEFLH - hypotheses are poorly supported by evolutionary theory. First, I use a simple model to show that effects of environmental harshness on life history evolution are incredibly diverse. In particular, small changes in basic but poorly understood variables - e.g., whether and how population density affects vital rates - can cause selection to favor very different life histories. Furthermore, I show that almost all life history theory used to justify HEFLH hypotheses is misapplied in the first place. The reason is that HEFLH hypotheses usually treat plastic responses to heterogeneous environmental conditions within a population, whereas the theory used to justify such hypotheses treat genetic responses to environmental changes across an entire population. Counter-intuitively, the predictions of the former do not generally apply to the latter: the optimal response to a harsh environment within a large heterogeneous environment is not necessarily the optimal strategy of a population uniformly inhabiting the same harsh environment. I discuss these theoretical results in light of the current state of empirical research."
10.1101/014886,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many traits and diseases. However, at existing sample sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated heritability [1]. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes may improve detection without the need for larger datasets [2].\n\nThe Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) [3] constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds. Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and has several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis. However, existing methods require distinct control samples between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability. Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs.\n\nWe apply our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls, enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease associations across five diseases not previously declared.\n\nOur technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and establishes robust limits on the expected FDR. This approach can improve SNP detection in GWAS, and give insight into shared aetiology between phenotypically related conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany diseases have a significant hereditary component, only part of which has been explained by analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Shared aetiology, treatment protocols, and overlapping results from existing GWAS suggest similarities in genetic susceptibility between related diseases, which may be exploited to detect more disease-associated SNPs without the need for further data.\n\nWe extend an existing method for detecting SNPs associated with a given disease by conditioning on association with another disease. Our extension allows GWAS for the two conditions to share control samples, enabling larger overall control groups and application to the common case when GWAS for related diseases pool control samples. We demonstrate that our technique limits the expected overall false discovery rate at a threshold dependent on the two diseases.\n\nWe apply our technique to genotype data from ten immune mediated diseases. Overall pleiotropy between phenotypes is demonstrated graphically. We are able to declare several SNPs significant at a genome-wide level whilst controlling at a lower false-discovery rate than would be possible using a conventional approach, identifying eight previously unknown disease associations.\n\nThis technique can improve SNP detection in GWAS by re-analysing existing data, and gives insight into the shared genetic bases of autoimmune diseases."
10.1101/014720,"For decades, neurophysiologists have characterized the biophysical properties of a rich diversity of neuron types. However, identifying common features and computational roles shared across neuron types is made more difficult by inconsistent conventions for collecting and reporting biophysical data. Here, we leverage NeuroElectro, a literature-based database of electrophysiological properties (www.neuroelectro.org), to better understand neuronal diversity - both within and across neuron types - and the confounding influences of methodological variability. We show that experimental conditions (e.g., electrode types, recording temperatures, or animal age) can explain a substantial degree of the literature-reported biophysical variability observed within a neuron type. Critically, accounting for experimental metadata enables massive cross-study data normalization and reveals that electrophysiological data are far more reproducible across labs than previously appreciated. Using this normalized dataset, we find that neuron types throughout the brain cluster by biophysical properties into 6-9 super-classes. These classes include intuitive clusters, such as fast-spiking basket cells, as well as previously unrecognized clusters, including a novel class of cortical and olfactory bulb interneurons that exhibit persistent activity at theta-band frequencies."
10.1101/014803,"Super-enhancers are the clusters of transcriptional enhancers that can drive cell-type-specific gene expression and also crucial in cell identity. Many disease-associated sequence variations are enriched in super-enhancer regions of disease-relevant cell types. Thus, super-enhancers can be used as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Current studies have identified super-enhancers in more than 100 cell types and demonstrated their functional importance. However, no centralized resource to integrate all these findings is available yet. We developed dbSUPER (http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/), the first integrated and interactive database of super-enhancers, with the primary goal of providing a resource for assistance in further studies related to transcriptional control of cell identity and disease. dbSUPER provides a responsive and user-friendly web interface to facilitate efficient and comprehensive search and browsing. The data can be easily sent to Galaxy instances, GREAT and Cistrome web servers for downstream analysis, and can be visualized in UCSC genome browser while custom tracks added automatically. The data can be downloaded and exported in variety of formats. Further, dbSUPER lists genes associated with the super-enhancers and links to various other databases such as GeneCards, UniProt and Entrez. dbSUPER also provides an overlap analysis tool, to annotate user defined regions. We believe dbSUPER is a valuable resource for the biologists and genetic research communities."
10.1101/014902,"When biomolecules physically interact, natural selection operates on them jointly. Contacting positions in protein and RNA structures exhibit correlated patterns of sequence evolution due to constraints imposed by the interaction, and molecular arms races can develop between interacting proteins in pathogens and their hosts. To evaluate how well methods developed to detect coevolving residues within proteins can be adapted for cross-species, inter-protein analysis, we used statistical criteria to quantify the performance of these methods in detecting inter-protein residues within 8 angstroms of each other in the co-crystal structures of 33 bacterial protein interactions. We also evaluated their performance for detecting known residues at the interface of a host-virus protein complex with a partially solved structure. Our quantitative benchmarking showed that all coevolutionary methods clearly benefit from alignments with many sequences. Methods that aim to detect direct correlations generally outperform other approaches. However, faster mutual information based methods are occasionally competitive in small alignments and with relaxed false positive rates. All commonly used null distributions are anti-conservative and have high false positive rates in some scenarios, although the empirical distribution of scores performs reasonably well with deep alignments. We conclude that coevolutionary analysis of cross-species protein interactions holds great promise but requires sequencing many more species pairs."
10.1101/014910,"The high regulatory complexity of vertebrates has been related to two closely spaced whole genome duplications (2R-WGD) that occurred before the divergence of the major vertebrate groups. Following these events, many developmental transcription factors (TFs) were retained in multiple copies and subsequently specialized in diverse functions, whereas others reverted to their singleton state. TFs are known to be generally rich in amino acid repeats or low-complexity regions (LCRs), such as polyalanine or polyglutamine runs, which can evolve rapidly and potentially influence the transcriptional activity of the protein. Here we test the hypothesis that LCRs have played a major role in the diversification of TF gene duplicates. We find that nearly half of the TF gene families (107 out of 237) originated during the 2R-WGD contain LCRs, compared to only a small percentage of the non-duplicated TF genes used as a control (15 out of 115). At the individual gene level, we observe that twice as many duplicated TFs have gained LCRs as non-duplicated TFs. In addition, duplicated TFs preferentially accumulate certain LCR types, the most prominent of which are alanine repeats. We experimentally test the role of alanine-rich LCRs in two different TF gene families, PHOX2A/PHOX2B and LHX2/LHX9. In both cases, the presence of the alanine-rich LCR in one of the copies (PHOX2B and LHX2) significantly increases the capacity of the TF to activate transcription. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that LCRs are important driving forces of evolutionary change in duplicated genes."
10.1101/014936,"We calculated the linkage disequilibrium between all pairs of variants in the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel, and make available the list of all highly correlated SNPs for use in association studies. Seventy-three percent of variant SNPs are correlated at r2>0.5 with at least one other SNP, and the mean number of correlated SNPs per variant over the whole genome is 64.9. Disequilibrium between distant SNPs is also common when minor allele frequency (MAF) is low: 24% of SNPs with MAF<0.1 are highly correlated with SNPs more than 100kb distant. While SNPs within regions with polymorphic inversions are highly correlated with somewhat larger numbers of SNPs, and these correlated SNPs are on average farther away, the probability that a SNP in such regions is highly correlated with at least one other SNP is very similar to SNPs outside inversions. Previous karyotyping of the DGRP lines has been inconsistent, and we used LD and genotype to investigate these discrepancies. When previous studies agreed on inversion karyotype, our analysis was almost perfectly concordant with those assignments. In discordant cases, and for inversion heterozygotes, our results suggest errors in two previous analyses, or discordance between genotype and karyotype. Heterozygosities of chromosome arms are in many cases surprisingly highly correlated, suggesting strong epsistatic selection during the inbreeding and maintenance of the DGRP lines."
10.1101/014985,"Poor DNA preservation is the most limiting factor in ancient genomic research. In the vast majority of ancient bones and teeth, endogenous DNA molecules only represent a minor fraction of the whole DNA extract, rendering traditional shot-gun sequencing approaches cost-ineffective for whole-genome characterization. Based on ancient human bone samples from temperate and tropical environments, we show that an initial EDTA-based enzymatic  pre-digestion of powdered bone increases the proportion of endogenous DNA several fold. By performing the pre-digestion step between 30 min and 6 hours on five bones, we identify the optimal pre-digestion time and document an average increase of 2.7 times in the endogenous DNA fraction after 1 hour of pre-digestion. With longer pre-digestion times, the increase is asymptotic while molecular complexity decreases. We repeated the experiment with n=21 and t=15-30, and document a significant increase in endogenous DNA content (one-sided paired t-test: p=0.009). We advocate the implementation of a short pre-digestion step as a standard procedure in ancient DNA extractions from bone material. Finally, we demonstrate on 14 ancient teeth that crushed cementum of the roots contains up to 14 times more endogenous DNA than the dentine. Our presented methodological guidelines considerably advance the ability to characterize ancient genomes."
10.1101/014977,"Alu insertions have contributed to >11% of the human genome and ~30-35 Alu subfamilies remain actively mobile, yet the characterization of polymorphic Alu insertions from short-read data remains a challenge. We build on existing computational methods to combine Alu detection and de novo assembly of WGS data as a means to reconstruct the full sequence of insertion events from Illumina paired end reads. Comparison with published calls obtained using PacBio long-reads indicates a false discovery rate below 5%, at the cost of reduced sensitivity due to the colocation of reference and non-reference repeats. We generate a highly accurate call set of 1,614 completely assembled Alu variants from 53 samples from the Human Genome Diversity Project panel. We utilize the reconstructed alternative insertion haplotypes to genotype 1,010 fully assembled insertions, obtaining >99% agreement with genotypes obtained by PCR. In our assembled sequences, we find evidence of premature insertion mechanisms and observe 5 truncation in 16% of AluYa5 and AluYb8 insertions. The sites of truncation coincide with stem-loop structures and SRP9/14 binding sites in the Alu RNA, implicating L1 ORF2p pausing in the generation of 5 truncations. Additionally, we identified variable AluJ and AluS elements that likely arose due to non-retrotransposition mechanisms."
10.1101/014928,"SPS catalyzes the synthesis of selenophosphate, the selenium donor for the synthesis of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), incorporated in selenoproteins in response to the UGA codon. SPS is unique among proteins of the selenoprotein biosynthesis machinery in that it is, in many species, a selenoprotein itself, although, as in all selenoproteins, Sec is often replaced by cysteine (Cys). In metazoan genomes we found, however, SPS genes with lineage specific substitutions other than Sec or Cys. Our results show that these non-Sec, non-Cys SPS genes originated through a number of independent gene duplications of diverse molecular origin from an ancestral selenoprotein SPS gene. Although of independent origin, complementation assays in fly mutants show that these genes share a common function, which most likely emerged in the ancestral metazoan gene. This function appears to be unrelated to selenophosphate synthesis, since all genomes encoding selenoproteins contain Sec or Cys SPS genes (SPS2), but those containing only non-Sec, non-Cys SPS genes (SPS1) do not encode selenoproteins. Thus, in SPS genes, through parallel duplications and subsequent convergent subfunctionalization, two functions initially carried by a single gene are recurrently segregated at two different loci. RNA structures enhancing the readthrough of the Sec-UGA codon in SPS genes, which may be traced back to prokaryotes, played a key role in this process. The SPS evolutionary history in metazoans constitute a remarkable example of the emergence and evolution of gene function. We have been able to trace this history with unusual detail thanks to the singular feature of SPS genes, wherein the amino acid at a single site determines protein function, and, ultimately, the evolutionary fate of an entire class of genes."
10.1101/014209,"Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSDMs) are a potentially valuable new tool for linking genotype to phenotype in functional studies. However, at a genome-wide level these cells have remained largely uncharacterised. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of naive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and IPSDMs using RNA-Seq. The IPSDM and MDM transcriptomes were broadly similar and exhibited a highly conserved response to LPS. However, there were also significant differences in the expression of genes associated with antigen presentation and tissue remodelling. Furthermore, genes coding for multiple chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment were more highly expressed in IPSDMs upon LPS stimulation. Additionally, analysing individual transcript expression identified hundreds of genes undergoing alternative promoter and 3' untranslated region usage following LPS treatment representing a previously under-appreciated level of regulation in the LPS response."
10.1101/014951,"We present an electronic format for exchanging data for HLA and KIR genotyping with extensions for next-generation sequencing (NGS). This format addresses NGS data exchange by refining the Histoimmunogenetics Markup Language (HML) to conform to the proposed Minimum Information for Reporting Immunogenomic NGS Genotyping (MIRING) reporting guidelines (miring.immunogenomics.org). Our refinements of HML include two major additions. First, NGS is supported by new XML structures to capture additional NGS data and metadata required to produce a genotyping result, including analysis-dependent (dynamic) and method-dependent (static) components. A full genotype, consensus sequence, and the surrounding metadata are included directly, while the raw sequence reads and platform documentation are externally referenced. Second, genotype ambiguity is fully represented by integrating Genotype List Strings, which use a hierarchical set of delimiters to represent allele and genotype ambiguity in a complete and accurate fashion. HML also continues to enable the transmission of legacy methods (e.g. site-specific oligonucleotide, sequence-specific priming, and sequence based typing (SBT)), adding features such as allowing multiple group-specific sequencing primers, and fully leveraging techniques that combine multiple methods to obtain a single result, such as SBT integrated with NGS.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/014944,"The giant deer Megaloceros giganteus is among the most fascinating Late Pleistocene Eurasian megafauna that became extinct at the end of the last ice age. Important questions persist regarding its phylogenetic relationship to contemporary taxa and the reasons for its extinction. We analyzed two large ancient cervid bone fragments recovered from cave sites in the Swabian Jura (Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) dated to 12,000 years ago. Using hybridization capture in combination with next generation sequencing, we were able to reconstruct nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from both specimens. Both mtDNAs cluster phylogenetically with fallow deer and show high similarity to previously studied partial Megaloceros giganteus DNA from Kamyshlov in western Siberia and Killavullen in Ireland. The unexpected presence of Megaloceros giganteus in Southern Germany after the Ice Age suggests a later survival in Central Europe than previously proposed. The complete mtDNAs provide strong phylogenetic support for a Dama-Megaloceros clade. Furthermore, isotope analyses support an increasing competition between giant deer, red deer, and reindeer after the Last Glacial Maximum, which might have contributed to the extinction of Megaloceros in Central Europe."

10.1101/015008,"All cancers arise as a result of the acquisition of somatic mutations that drive the disease progression. A number of computational tools have been developed to identify driver genes for a specific cancer from a group of cancer samples. However, it remains a challenge to identify driver mutations/genes for an individual patient and design drug therapies. We developed iCAGES, a novel statistical framework to rapidly analyze patient-specific cancer genomic data, prioritize personalized cancer driver events and predict personalized therapies. iCAGES includes three consecutive layers: the first layer integrates contributions from coding, non-coding and structural variations to infer driver variants. For coding mutations, we developed a radial support vector machine using manually curated mutations to predict their driver potential. The second layer identifies driver genes, by using information from the first layer and integrating prior biological knowledge on gene-gene and gene-phenotype networks. The third layer prioritizes personalized drug treatment, by classifying potential driver genes into different categories and querying drug-gene databases. Compared to currently available tools, iCAGES achieves better performance by correctly classifying point coding driver mutations (AUC=0.97, 95% CI: 0.97-0.97, significantly better than the second best tool with P=0.01) and genes (AUC=0.93, 95% CI: 0.93-0.94, significantly better than MutSigCV with P<1x10-15). We also illustrated two examples where iCAGES correctly nominated two targeted drugs for two advanced cancer patients with exceptional response, based on their somatic mutation profiles. iCAGES leverages personal genomic information and prior biological knowledge, effectively identifies cancer driver genes and predicts treatment strategies. iCAGES is available at http://icages.usc.edu."
10.1101/015032,"We engineered a transdermal neuromodulation approach that targets peripheral (cranial and spinal) nerves and utilizes their afferent pathways as signaling conduits to influence brain function. We investigated the effects of this transdermal electrical neurosignaling (TEN) method on sympathetic physiology in human volunteers under different experimental conditions. In all cases, the TEN involved delivering high-frequency pulsed electrical currents to ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the right trigeminal nerve (V1/V2) and cervical spinal nerve afferents (C2/C3). Under resting conditions when subjects were not challenged or presented with environmental stimuli, TEN significantly suppressed basal sympathetic tone compared to sham as indicated by functional infrared thermography of facial temperatures. In a different experiment conducted under similar resting conditions, subjects treated with TEN reported significantly lower levels of tension and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States scale compared to sham. In a third experiment when subjects were experimentally stressed by a classical fear conditioning paradigm and a series of time-constrained cognitive tasks, TEN produced a significant suppression of heart rate variability, galvanic skin conductance, and salivary -amylase levels compared to sham. Collectively these observations demonstrate TEN can dampen basal sympathetic tone and attenuate sympathetic activity in response to acute stress induction. Our physiological and biochemical observations are consistent with the hypothesis that TEN modulates noradrenergic signaling to suppress sympathetic activity. We conclude that dampening sympathetic activity in such a manner represents a promising approach to managing daily stress."
10.1101/014993,"Humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. The homologous pairs are almost identical pairs of chromosomes. For the most part, differences in homologous chromosome occur at certain documented positions called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A haplotype of an individual is the pair of sequences of SNPs on the two homologous chromosomes. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring haplotypes of individuals from mate-pair reads of their genome. We give a simple formula for the coverage needed for haplotype assembly, under a generative model. The analysis here leverages connections of this problem with decoding convolutional codes."
10.1101/015040,"The only way we can interact with the world is through movements, and our primary interactions are via the hands, thus any loss of hand function has immediate impact on our quality of life. However, to date it has not been systematically assessed how coordination in the hands joints affects every day actions. This is important for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, to understand the representations and computations underlying motor control \""in-the-wild\"" situations, and secondly to develop smarter controllers for prosthetic hands that have the same functionality as natural limbs. In this work we exploit the correlation structure of our hand and finger movements in daily-life. The novelty of our idea is that instead of averaging variability out, we take the view that the structure of variability may contain valuable information about the task being performed. We asked seven subjects to interact in 17 daily-life situations, and quantified behaviour in a principled manner using CyberGlove body sensor networks that, after accurate calibration, track all major joints of the hand. Our key findings are: 1. We confirmed that hand control in daily-life tasks is very low-dimensional, with four to five dimensions being sufficient to explain 80-90% of the variability in the natural movement data. 2. We established a universally applicable measure of manipulative complexity that allowed us to measure and compare limb movements across tasks. We used Bayesian latent variable models to model the low-dimensional structure of finger joint angles in natural actions. 3. This allowed us to build a naive classifier that within the first 1000ms of action initiation (from a flat hand start configuration) predicted which of the 17 actions was going to be executed - enabling us to reliably predict the action intention from very short-time-scale initial data, further revealing the foreseeable nature of hand movements for control of neuroprosthetics and tele operation purposes. 4. Using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on our latent variable model permitted us to reconstruct with high accuracy (<5{degrees}-6{degrees} MAE) the movement trajectory of missing fingers by simply tracking the remaining fingers. Overall, our results suggest the hypothesis that specific hand actions are orchestrated by the brain in such a way that in the natural tasks of daily-life there is sufficient redundancy and predictability to be directly exploitable for neuroprosthetics."
10.1101/015057,"The grid cells discovered in the rodent medial entorhinal cortex have been proposed to provide a metric for Euclidean space, possibly even hardwired in the embryo. Yet one class of models describing the formation of grid unit selectivity is entirely based on developmental self-organization, and as such it predicts that the metric it expresses should reflect the environment to which the animal has adapted. We show that, according to self-organizing models, if raised in a non-Euclidean hyperbolic cage rats should be able to form hyperbolic grids. For a given range of grid spacing relative to the radius of negative curvature of the hyperbolic surface, such grids are predicted to appear as multi-peaked firing maps, in which each peak has seven neighbours instead of the Euclidean six, a prediction that can be tested in experiments. We thus demonstrate that a useful universal neuronal metric, in the sense of a multi-scale ruler and compass that remain unaltered when changing environments, can be extended to other than the standard Euclidean plane.\n\nAbbreviation"

10.1101/015107,"BackgroundGenome-scale \""-omics\"" measurements are challenging to benchmark due to the enormous variety of unique biological molecules involved. Mixtures of previously-characterized samples can be used to benchmark repeatability and reproducibility using component proportions as truth for the measurement. We describe and evaluate experiments characterizing the performance of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) measurements, and discuss cases where mixtures can serve as effective process controls.\n\nResultsWe apply a linear model to total RNA mixture samples in RNA-seq experiments. This model provides a context for performance benchmarking. The parameters of the model fit to experimental results can be evaluated to assess bias and variability of the measurement of a mixture. A linear model describes the behavior of mixture expression measures and provides a context for performance benchmarking. Residuals from fitting the model to experimental data can be used as a metric for evaluating the effect that an individual step in an experimental process has on the linear response function and precision of the underlying measurement while identifying signals affected by interference from other sources. Effective benchmarking requires well-defined mixtures, which for RNA-Seq requires knowledge of the messenger RNA (mRNA) content of the individual total RNA components. We demonstrate and evaluate an experimental method suitable for use in genome-scale process control and lay out a method utilizing spike-in controls to determine mRNA content of total RNA in samples.\n\nConclusionsGenome-scale process controls can be derived from mixtures. These controls relate prior knowledge of individual components to a complex mixture, allowing assessment of measurement performance. The mRNA fraction accounts for differential enrichment of mRNA from varying total RNA samples. Spike-in controls can be utilized to measure this relationship between mRNA content and input total RNA. Our mixture analysis method also enables estimation of the proportions of an unknown mixture, even when component-specific markers are not previously known, whenever pure components are measured alongside the mixture."
10.1101/015149,"This paper deals with an abstraction of a unified problem of drug discovery and pathogen identification. Here, the \""lead compounds\"" are abstracted as inhibitors, pathogenic proteins as defectives, and the mixture of \""ineffective\"" chemical compounds and non-pathogenic proteins as normal items. A defective could be immune to the presence of an inhibitor in a test. So, a test containing a defective is positive iff it does not contain its \""associated\"" inhibitor. The goal of this paper is to identify the defectives, inhibitors, and their \""associations\"" with high probability, or in other words, learn the Immune Defectives Graph (IDG). We propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design, a probabilistic two-stage adaptive pooling design and decoding algorithms for learning the IDG. For the two-stage adaptive-pooling design, we show that the sample complexity of the number of tests required to guarantee recovery of the inhibitors, defectives and their associations with high probability, i.e., the upper bound, exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of items. For the non-adaptive pooling design, in the large inhibitor regime, we show that the upper bound exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of inhibitors."
10.1101/015123,"E-Cadherin (CDH1) genetic variations may be involved in invasion and metastasis of various cancers by altering gene transcriptional activity of epithelial cells. However, published studies on the association of CDH1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer (PCA)risk remain contradictory, owing to differences in living habits and genetic backgrounds. To derive a more better and comprehensive conclusion, the present meta-analysis was performed. Electronic searches of several databases were conducted for all publications on the association between the CDH1 -160 C/A polymorphism and prostate cancer before Oct 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for statistical analysis. A total of 7 eligible studies including 1294 cases and 1782 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis indicated that the -160A allele carriers (AA, CA, AA+CA and A allele) had an increased risk of PCA compared with the homozygotes (CC). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, a positive association was found in Asians with A allele, AA, CA, AA+CA genotype and Caucasian descendants with AA genotype, dominant and recessive models. On the contrary, a decreased prostate cancer risk was found in Africans with heterozygous, dominant and allele models. Taken together, this meta-analysis showed that the CDH1 -160A allele might be a risk factor for prostate cancer in Asians and Caucasians. However, this result should be verified by additional population-based studies with large sample sizes."
10.1101/013433,"We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost four hundred thousand polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies1-8 and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of western and far eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6. By ~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin9 of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe."
10.1101/015065,"Imaging genetics is an emerging field in which the association between genes and neuroimaging-based quantitative phenotypes are used to explore the functional role of genes in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology in the context of healthy function and neuropsychiatric disorders. The main obstacle for researchers in the field is the high dimensionality of the data in both the imaging phenotypes and the genetic variants commonly typed. In this article, we develop a novel method that utilizes Gene Ontology, an online database, to select and prioritize certain genes, employing a stratified false discovery rate (sFDR) approach to investigate their associations with imaging phenotypes. sFDR has the potential to increase power in genome wide association studies (GWAS), and is quickly gaining traction as a method for multiple testing correction. Our novel approach addresses both the pressing need in genetic research to move beyond candidate gene studies, while not being overburdened with a loss of power due to multiple testing. As an example of our methodology, we perform a GWAS of hippocampal volume using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample."
10.1101/014894,"Despite extraordinary efforts to profile cancer genomes on a large scale, interpreting the vast amount of genomic data in the light of cancer evolution and in a clinically relevant manner remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that cancer next-generation sequencing data is dominated by the signature of growth governed by a power-law distribution of mutant allele frequencies. The power-law signature is common to multiple tumor types and is a consequence of the effectively-neutral evolutionary dynamics that underpin the evolution of a large proportion of cancers, giving rise to the abundance of mutations responsible for intra-tumor heterogeneity. Importantly, the law allows the measurement, in each individual cancer, of the in vivo mutation rate and the timing of mutations with remarkable precision. This result provides a new way to interpret cancer genomic data by considering the physics of tumor growth in a way that is both patient-specific and clinically relevant."
10.1101/015099,"Because the rice genome has been sequenced entirely, search to find specific features at genome-wide scale is of high importance. Palindromic sequences are important DNA motifs involved in the regulation of different cellular processes and are a potential source of genetic instability. In order to search and study the long palindromic regions in the rice genome \""R\"" statistical programming language was used. All palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats with spacer DNA, could be analyzed and sorted according to their frequency, size, GC content, compact index etc. The results showed that the overall palindrome frequency was high in rice genome (nearly 51000 palindromes), with highest and lowest number of palindromes, respectively belongs to chromosome 1 and 12. Palindrome numbers could well explain the rice chromosome expansion (R2>92%). Average GC content of the palindromic sequences is 42.1%, indicating AT-richness and hence, the low-complexity of palindromic sequences. The results also showed different compact indices of palindromes in different chromosomes (43.2 per cM in chromosome 8 and 34.5 per cM in chromosome 3, as highest and lowest, respectively). The possible application of palindrome identification can be the use in the development of a molecular marker system facilitating some genetic studies such as evaluation of genetic variation and gene mapping and also serving as a useful tool in population structure analysis and genome evolution studies. Based on these results it can be concluded that the rice genome is rich in long palindromic sequences that triggered most variation during evolution.\n\nAvailability: The R scripts used to construct the palindrome sequence library are available upon request."

Our analysis captures the statistical properties of the naive repertoire, first after its initial generation via VDJ recombination and then after selection for functionality. We also infer statistical properties of the somatic hypermutation machinery (exclusive of subsequent effects of selection). Our main results are the following: the B-cell repertoire is substantially more diverse than T-cell repertoires, due to longer junctional insertions; sequences that pass initial selection are distinguished by having a higher probability of being generated in a VDJ recombination event; somatic hypermutations have a non-uniform distribution along the V gene that is well explained by an independent site model for the sequence context around the hypermutation site."
10.1101/015156,"MotivationThere are many different forms of genomic structural variation that can be broadly classified into two groups as copy number variation (CNV) and balanced rearrangements. Although many algorithms are now available in the literature that aim to characterize CNVs, discovery of balanced rearrangements (inversions and translocations) remains an open problem. This is mainly because the breakpoints of such events typically lie within segmental duplications and common repeats, which reduce the mappability of short reads. The 1000 Genomes Project spearheaded the development of several methods to identify inversions, however, they are limited to relatively short inversions, and there are currently no available algorithms to discover large inversions using high throughput sequencing technologies (HTS).\n\nResultsHere we propose to use a sequencing method (Kitzman et al., 2011) originally developed to improve haplotype phasing to characterize large genomic inversions. This method, called pooled clone sequencing, merges the advantages of clone based sequencing approaches with the speed and cost efficiency of HTS technologies. Using data generated with pooled clone sequencing method, we developed a novel algorithm, dipSeq, to discover large inversions (>500 Kbp). We show the power of dipSeq first on simulated data, and then apply it to the genome of a HapMap individual (NA12878). We were able to accurately discover all previously known and experimentally validated large inversions in the same genome. We also identified a novel inversion, and confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization.\n\nAvailabilityImplementation of the dipSeq algorithm is available at https://github.com/BilkentCompGen/dipseq\n\nContactcalkan@cs.bilkent.edu.tr, francesca.antonacci@uniba.it"
10.1101/015172,"A long-standing idea is that the macroevolutionary adaptive landscape - a  map of phenotype to fitness - constrains evolution because certain phenotypes are fit, while others are universally unfit. Such constraints should be evident in traits that, across many species, cluster around particular modal values, with few intermediates between modes. Here, I compile a new global database of 599 species from 94 plant families showing that stomatal ratio, an important functional trait affecting photosynthesis, is multimodal, hinting at distinct peaks in the adaptive landscape. The dataset confirms that most plants have all their stomata on the lower leaf surface (hypostomy), but shows for the first time that species with roughly half their stomata on each leaf surface (amphistomy) form a distinct mode in the trait distribution. Based on a new evolutionary process model, this multimodal pattern is unlikely without constraint. Further, multimodality has evolved repeatedly across disparate families, evincing long-term constraint on the adaptive landscape. A simple cost-benefit model of stomatal ratio demonstrates that selection alone is sufficient to generate an adaptive landscape with multiple peaks. Finally, phylogenetic comparative methods indicate that life history evolution drives shifts between peaks. This implies that the adaptive benefit conferred by amphistomy - increased photosynthesis - is most important in plants with fast life histories, challenging existing ideas that amphistomy is an adaptation to thick leaves and open habitats. I conclude that peaks in the adaptive landscape have been constrained by selection over much of land plant evolution, leading to predictable, repeatable patterns of evolution."
10.1101/015164,"Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data to highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) associations in the IL-2RA (CD25) gene region. For T1D, both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four T1D association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for MS, the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using stepwise analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major T1D associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate LD between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (r2 [~=] 0.3) and our two SNP model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for MS affect CD25 expression on distinct subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for T1D and MS. Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data."
10.1101/015180,"Most proteins show changes in level across growth conditions. Many of these changes seem to be coordinated with the specific growth rate rather than the growth environment or the protein function. Although cellular growth rates, gene expression levels and gene regulation have been at the center of biological research for decades, there are only a few models giving a base line prediction of the dependence of the proteome fraction occupied by a gene with the specific growth rate.\n\nWe present a simple model that predicts a widely coordinated increase in the fraction of many proteins out of the proteome, proportionally with the growth rate. The model reveals how passive redistribution of resources, due to active regulation of only a few proteins, can have proteome wide effects that are quantitatively predictable. Our model provides a potential explanation for why and how such a coordinated response of a large fraction of the proteome to the specific growth rate arises under different environmental conditions. The simplicity of our model can also be useful by serving as a baseline null hypothesis in the search for active regulation. We exemplify the usage of the model by analyzing the relationship between growth rate and proteome composition for the model microorganism E.coli as reflected in two recent proteomics data sets spanning various growth conditions. We find that the fraction out of the proteome of a large number of proteins, and from different cellular processes, increases proportionally with the growth rate. Notably, ribosomal proteins, which have been previously reported to increase in fraction with growth rate, are only a small part of this group of proteins. We suggest that, although the fractions of many proteins change with the growth rate, such changes could be part of a global effect, not requiring specific cellular control mechanisms."
10.1101/015222,"HLA genotyping via next generation sequencing (NGS) poses challenges for the use of HLA allele names to analyze and discuss sequence polymorphism. NGS will identify many new synonymous and non-coding HLA sequence variants. Allele names identify the types of nucleotide polymorphism that define an allele (non-synonymous, synonymous and non-coding changes), but do not describe how polymorphism is distributed among the individual features (the flanking untranslated regions, exons and introns) of a gene. Further, HLA alleles cannot be named in the absence of antigen-recognition domain (ARD) encoding exons. Here, a system for describing HLA polymorphism in terms of HLA gene features (GFs) is proposed. This system enumerates the unique nucleotide sequences for each GF in an HLA gene, and records these in a GF enumeration notation that allows both more granular dissection of allele-level HLA polymorphism, and the discussion and analysis of GFs in the absence of ARD-encoding exon sequences.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/015214,"Protein expression and post-translational modification levels are tightly regulated in neoplastic cells to maintain cellular processes known as  cancer hallmarks. The first Pan-Cancer initiative of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has aggregated protein expression profiles for 3,467 patient samples from 11 tumor types using the antibody based reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology. The resultant proteomic data can be utilized to computationally infer protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and to study the commonalities and differences across tumor types. In this study, we compare the performance of 13 established network inference methods in their capacity to retrieve literature-curated pathway interactions from RPPA data. We observe that no single method has the best performance in all tumor types, but a group of six methods, including diverse techniques such as correlation, mutual information, and regression, consistently rank highly among the tested methods. A consensus network from this high-performing group reveals that signal transduction events involving receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the RAS/MAPK pathway, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, as well as innate and adaptive immunity signaling, are the most significant PPIs shared across all tumor types. Our results illustrate the utility of the RPPA platform as a tool to study proteomic networks in cancer.\n\nAvailabilityPPI networks from the TCGA or user-provided data can be visualized with the ProtNet web application at http://www.sanderlab.org/protnet/."
10.1101/015230,"The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for HLA and KIR genotyping is rapidly advancing knowledge of genetic variation of these highly polymorphic loci. NGS genotyping is poised to replace older methods for clinical use, but standard methods for reporting and exchanging these new, high quality genotype data are needed. The Immunogenomic NGS Consortium, a broad collaboration of histocompatibility and immunogenetics clinicians, researchers, instrument manufacturers and software developers, has developed the Minimum Information for Reporting Immunogenomic NGS Genotyping (MIRING) reporting guidelines. MIRING is a checklist that specifies the content of NGS genotyping results as well as a set of messaging guidelines for reporting the results. A MIRING message includes five categories of structured information - message annotation, reference context, full genotype, consensus sequence and novel polymorphism - and references to three categories of accessory information - NGS platform documentation, read processing documentation and primary data. These eight categories of information ensure the long-term portability and broad application of this NGS data for all current histocompatibility and immunogenetics use cases. In addition, MIRING can be extended to allow the reporting of genotype data generated using pre-NGS technologies. Because genotyping results reported using MIRING are easily updated in accordance with reference and nomenclature databases, MIRING represents a bold departure from previous methods of reporting HLA and KIR genotyping results, which have provided static and less-portable data. More information about MIRING can be found online at miring.immunogenomics.org."
10.1101/015198,"Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of neural electrode arrays with hundreds of closely-spaced recording sites, and electrodes with thousands of sites are currently under development. These probes will in principle allow the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons. However, use of this technology requires the development of techniques for decoding the spike times of the recorded neurons, from the raw data captured from the probes. There currently exists no practical solution to this problem of \""spike sorting\"" for large, dense electrode arrays. Here, we present a set of novel tools to solve this problem, implemented in a suite of practical, user-friendly, open-source software. We validate these methods on data from rat cortex, demonstrating error rates as low as 5%."
10.1101/015297,"A nanopore-based approach to peptide sequencing without labels or immobilization is considered. It is based on a tandem cell (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 167-171) with the structure [cis1, upstream pore (UNP), trans1/cis2, downstream pore (DNP), trans2]. An amino or carboxyl exopeptidase attached to the downstream side of UNP cleaves successive leading residues in a peptide threading from cis1 through UNP. A cleaved residue translocates to and through DNP where it is identified. A Fokker-Planck model is used to compute translocation statistics for each amino acid type. Multiple discriminators, including a variant of the current blockade level and translocation times through trans1/cis2 and DNP, identify a residue. Calculations show the 20 amino acids to be grouped by charge (+, -, neutral) and ordered within each group (which makes error correction easier). The minimum cleaving interval required of the exopeptidase, the sample size (number of copies of the peptide to sequence or runs with one copy) to identify a residue with a given confidence level, and confidence levels for a given sample size are calculated. The results suggest that if the exopeptidase cleaves each and every residue and does so in a reasonable time, peptide sequencing with acceptable (and correctable) errors may be feasible. If validated experimentally the proposed device could be an alternative to mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis. Implementation-related issues are discussed."
10.1101/015339,"MotivationGenome-wide association studies have been conducted in inbred populations where the sample size is small. The ordinary association p-values and multiple testing correction therefore become questionable, as the detected genetic effect may or may not be due to chance, depending on the minor allele frequency distribution across the genome. Instead of permutation testing, marker-specific false positive rate can be analytically calculated in inbred populations without heterozygotes.\n\nResultsSolutions of exact p-values for genome-wide association studies in inbred populations were derived and implemented. An example is presented to illustrate that the marker-specific experiment-wise p-value varies as the genome-wide minor allele frequency distribution changes. A simulation using real Arabidopsis thaliana genome indicates that the use of exact p-values improves detection power and reduces inflation due to population structure. An analysis of a defense-related case-control phenotype using the exact p-values revealed the causal locus, where markers with higher MAFs had smaller p-values than the top variants with lower MAFs in ordinary genome-wide association analysis.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationProject URL: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/statomics/.

10.1101/015321,"The palmaris longus muscle is widely recognized for its notable variability in living humans. These variations include not only muscle belly reversal, distinct double muscle bellies, duplication and triplication, but also total uni-or bilateral agenesis (absence). A review of the literature and data novel to this study illustrate that different populations of humans exhibit remarkable variation in the frequency of palmaris longus agenesis, from less than 5% of Chinese to nearly 65% of Indians. Comparative dissection-derived data reveal substantial variation in palmaris longus agenesis (PLA) in populations of extant humans (H. sapiens), chimpanzees (Pan spp.), and gorillas (Gorilla spp.) - but not orangutans (Pongo spp.), which apparently always develop this muscle. From this pattern, we infer that palmaris longus is undergoing non-adaptive, stochastic evolution in the extant African Homininae, while it continues to have adaptive purpose in Pongo, likely due to the orangutans greater degree of arboreality than the African apes and humans. Clinical evidence supports this conclusion, at least as it applies to humans. This study highlights the utility of comparative soft tissue data collection and interpretation in elucidating the evolution of anatomical structures that do not fossilize."
10.1101/015289,"The movement of transposable elements from place to place in a genome requires both element-encoded and host-encoded factors. In DNA cut & paste transposition, the element-encoded transposase performs the DNA breakage and joining reactions that excise the element from the donor site and integrate it into the new insertion site. Host factors can influence many aspects of transposition. Notably, host DNA repair factors mediate the regeneration of intact duplex DNA necessary after transposase action by repairing the double strand break in the broken donor backbone, from which the transposon has excised, and repairing the single strand gaps that flank the newly inserted transposon. We have exploited the ability of the mammalian transposon piggyBat, a member of the piggyBac superfamily, to transpose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and used the yeast single gene deletion collection to screen for genes encoding host factors involved in piggyBat transposition. piggyBac transposition is distinguished by the fact that piggyBac elements insert into TTAA target sites and also that the donor backbone is restored to its pre-transposon sequence after transposon excision, that is, excision is precise. We have found that repair of the broken donor backbone requires the non-homologous end-joining repair pathway (NHEJ). By contrast, NHEJ is not required for DNA repair at the new insertion site. Thus multiple DNA repair pathways are required for piggyBac transposition."
10.1101/015305,"Perception and transduction of temperature changes result in altered growth enabling plants to adapt to increased ambient temperature. While PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) has been identified as a major ambient temperature signaling hub, its upstream regulation seems complex and is poorly understood. Here, we exploited natural variation for thermo-responsive growth in Arabidopsis thaliana using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. We identified GIRAFFE2.1, a major QTL explaining ~18% of the phenotypic variation for temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation in the Bay-0 x Sha recombinant inbred line population. Transgenic complementation demonstrated that allelic variation in the circadian clock regulator EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) is underlying this QTL. The source of variation could be allocated to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ELF3 coding region, resulting in differential expression of PIF4 and its target genes, likely causing the observed natural variation in thermo-responsive growth. In combination with other recent studies, this work establishes the role of ELF3 in the ambient temperature signaling network. Natural variation of ELF3-mediated gating of PIF4 expression during nightly growing periods seems to be affected by a coding sequence quantitative trait nucleotide that confers a selective advantage in certain environments. In addition, natural ELF3 alleles seem to differentially integrate temperature and photoperiod cues to induce architectural changes. Thus, ELF3 emerges as an essential coordinator of growth and development in response to diverse environmental cues and implicates ELF3 as an important target of adaptation."
10.1101/015396,"The Armenians are a culturally isolated population who historically inhabited a region in the Near East bounded by the Mediterranean and Black seas and the Caucasus, but remain underrepresented in genetic studies and have a complex history including a major geographic displacement during World War One. Here, we analyse genome-wide variation in 173 Armenians and compare them to 78 other worldwide populations. We find that Armenians form a distinctive cluster linking the Near East, Europe, and the Caucasus. We show that Armenian diversity can be explained by several mixtures of Eurasian populations that occurred between [~]3,000 and [~]2,000 BCE, a period characterized by major population migrations after the domestication of the horse, appearance of chariots, and the rise of advanced civilizations in the Near East. However, genetic signals of population mixture cease after [~]1,200 BCE when Bronze Age civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean world suddenly and violently collapsed. Armenians have since remained isolated and genetic structure within the population developed [~]500 years ago when Armenia was divided between the Ottomans and the Safavid Empire in Iran. Finally, we show that Armenians have higher genetic affinity to Neolithic Europeans than other present-day Near Easterners, and that 29% of the Armenian ancestry may originate from an ancestral population best represented by Neolithic Europeans."
10.1101/015404,"Intracellular transcriptional regulators and extracellular signaling pathways together regulate the allocation of cell fates during development, but how their molecular activities are integrated to establish the correct proportions of cells with particular fates is not known. Here we study this question in the context of the decision between the epiblast (Epi) and the primitive endoderm (PrE) fate that occurs in the mammalian preimplantation embryo. Using an embryonic stem (ES) cell model, we discover two successive functions of FGF/MAPK signaling in this decision. First, the pathway needs to be inhibited to make the PrE-like gene expression program accessible for activation by GATA transcription factors in ES cells. In a second step, MAPK signaling levels determine the threshold concentration of GATA factors required for PrE-like differentiation, and thereby control the proportion of cells differentiating along this lineage. Our findings can be explained by a simple mutual repression circuit modulated by FGF/MAPK signaling. This may be a general network architecture to integrate the activity of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulators, and serve to balance proportions of cell fates in several contexts."
10.1101/015412,"The study of gene essentiality in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. Technological advances in genome editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 systems have set the stage for identifying human cell line core and context-dependent essential genes. However, first generation negative selection screens using CRISPR technology demonstrate extreme variability across different cell lines. To advance the development of the catalogue of human core and context-dependent essential genes, we have developed an optimized, ultracomplex, genome-scale gRNA library of 176,500 guide RNAs targeting 17,661 genes and have applied it to negative and positive selection screens in a human cell line. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we find CRISPR-based screens yield double to triple the number of essential genes than were previously observed using systematic RNA interference, including many genes at moderate expression levels that are largely refractory to RNAi methods. We further characterized four essential genes of unknown significance and found that they all likely exist in protein complexes with other essential genes. For example, RBM48 and ARMC7 are both essential nuclear proteins, strongly interact and are commonly amplified across major cancers. Our findings suggest the CRISPR-Cas9 system fundamentally alters the landscape for systematic reverse genetics in human cells for elucidating gene function, identifying disease genes, and uncovering therapeutic targets."

10.1101/015370,"BackgroundDifferential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. We previously introduced an intermediate statistical approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base resolution without relying on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript assembly.\n\nResultsWe present the derfinder software that improves our annotation-agnostic approach to RNA-seq analysis by: (1) implementing a computationally efficient bump-hunting approach to identify DERs which permits genome-scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) introducing a flexible statistical modeling framework, including multi-group and time-course analyses and (3) introducing a new set of data visualizations for expressed region analysis. We apply this approach to public RNA-seq data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and BrainSpan project to show that derfinder permits the analysis of hundreds of samples at base resolution in R, identifies expression outside of known gene boundaries and can be used to visualize expressed regions at base-resolution. In simulations our base resolution approaches enable discovery in the presence of incomplete annotation and is nearly as powerful as feature-level methods when the annotation is complete.\n\nConclusionsderfinder analysis using expressed region-level and single base-level approaches provides a compromise between full transcript reconstruction and feature-level analysis.\n\nThe package is available from Bioconductor at www.bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder."

10.1101/015479,"Intracellular immune receptors of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR or NLR) proteins often function in pairs, with \""helper\"" proteins required for the activity of \""sensors\"" that mediate pathogen recognition. The NLR helper NRC1 (NB-LRR protein required for HR-associated cell death 1) has been described as a signalling hub required for the cell death mediated by both cell surface and intracellular immune receptors in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. However, this work predates the availability of the N. benthamiana genome and whether NRC1 is indeed required for the reported phenotypes has not been confirmed. Here, we investigated the NRC family of solanaceous plants using a combination of genome annotation, phylogenetics, gene silencing and genetic complementation experiments. We discovered that a paralog of NRC1, we termed NRC3, is required for the hypersensitive cell death triggered by the disease resistance protein Pto but not Rx and Mi-1.2. NRC3 may also contribute to the hypersensitive cell death triggered by the receptor-like protein Cf-4.

10.1101/015438,"The pursuit of circuits and metabolic pathways of increasing complexity and ro-bustness in synthetic biology will require engineering new regulatory tools. Feedback control based on relevant molecules, including toxic intermediates and environmental signals, would enable genetic circuits to react appropriately to changing conditions. In this work, variants of qacR, a tetR family repressor, were generated by computational protein design and screened in a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system for responsiveness to a new targeted effector. The modified repressors target vanillin, a growth-inhibiting small molecule found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates and other industrial processes. Promising candidates from the in vitro screen were further characterized in vitro and in vivo in a gene circuit. The screen yielded two qacR mutants that respond to vanillin both in vitro and in vivo. We believe this process, a combination of the generation of variants coupled with in vitro screening, can serve as a framework for designing new sensors for other target compounds."

10.1101/015529,"The concept of a fitness landscape, which describes the relation between genotype (or phenotype) and fitness as a surface on which the population climbs uphill towards local peaks, is a central conceptual tool in evolutionary biology. Inherent in this metaphor is the assumption that the distance between any two points can be defined in the same way as for Euclidean space. However, many of the processes which generate genetic variation, such as gene duplication and lateral gene transfer, are not symmetric by nature, but occur more readily in one direction than the other. This asymmetry is also found in phenotypes, for reasons associated with the genotype-phenotype map and developmental constraints. This article provides an overview of of these processes and suggest how existing methods can be used for incorporating these asymmetric processes when visualising fitness landscapes."

10.1101/015552,"A method for de novo assembly of data from the Oxford Nanopore MinION instrument is presented which is able to reconstruct the sequence of an entire bacterial chromosome in a single contig. Initially, overlaps between nanopore reads are detected. Reads are then subjected to one or more rounds of error correction by a multiple alignment process employing partial order graphs. After correction, reads are assembled using the Celera assembler. Finally, the assembly is polished using signal-level data from the nanopore employing a novel hidden Markov model. We show that this method is able to assemble nanopore reads from Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 into a single contig of length 4.6Mb permitting a full reconstruction of gene order. The resulting draft assembly has 98.4% nucleotide identity compared to the finished reference genome. After polishing the assembly with our signal-level HMM, the nucleotide identity is improved to 99.4%.

10.1101/015560,"The human mutation rate is an essential parameter for studying the evolution of our species, interpreting present-day genetic variation, and understanding the incidence of genetic disease. Nevertheless, our current estimates of the rate are uncertain. Most notably, recent approaches based on counting de novo mutations in family pedigrees have yielded significantly smaller values than classical methods based on sequence divergence. Here, we propose a new method that uses the fine-scale human recombination map to calibrate the rate of accumulation of mutations. By comparing local heterozygosity levels in diploid genomes to the genetic distance scale over which these levels change, we are able to estimate a long-term mutation rate averaged over hundreds or thousands of generations. We infer a rate of 1.61 {+/-} 0.13 x 10-8 mutations per base per generation, which falls in between phylogenetic and pedigree-based estimates, and we suggest possible mechanisms to reconcile our estimate with previous studies. Our results support intermediate-age divergences among human populations and between humans and other great apes."

Knockdown of sugar transporter genes, stp1 and stp2 in tomato seedlings triggers corresponding reductions of glucose and fructose, but not xylose, in collected root exudate. This corresponds directly with reduced infectivity and stylet thrusting of the promiscuous PPN Meloidogyne incognita, however we observe no impact on the infectivity or stylet thrusting of the selective Solanaceae PPN Globodera pallida.

10.1101/015511,"F-specific filamentous phage of Escherichia coli (Ff: f1, M13 or fd) are long thin filaments (860 nm x 6 nm). They have been a major workhorse in display technologies and bionanotechnology; however, some applications are limited by the high length-to-diameter ratio of Ff. Furthermore, use of functionalized Ff outside of laboratory containment is in part hampered by the fact that they are genetically modified viruses. We have now developed a system for production and purification of very short functionalized Ff-phage-derived nanorods, named Ff-nano, that are only 50 nm in length. In contrast to standard Ff-derived vectors that replicate in E. coli and contain antibiotic-resistance genes, Ff-nano are protein-DNA complexes that cannot replicate on their own and do not contain any coding sequences. These nanorods show an increased resistance to heating at 70 {degrees}C in 1 % SDS in comparison to the full-length Ff phage of the same coat composition. We demonstrate that functionalized Ff-nano particles are suitable for application as detection particles in sensitive and quantitative \""dipstick\"" lateral flow diagnostic assay for human plasma fibronectin."
10.1101/015586,"Fitness results from the optimal balance between survival, mating success and fecundity. The interactions between these three components of fitness vary importantly depending on the selective context, from positive covariation between them, to antagonistic pleiotropic relationships when fitness increases in one reduce fitness of others. Therefore, elucidating the routes through which selection shapes life history and phenotypic adaptations via these fitness components is of primary significance to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, while the fitness components mediated by natural (survival) and sexual (mating success) selection have extensively been debated from most possible perspectives, fecundity selection remains considerably less studied. Here, we review the theory, evidence and implications of fecundity selection as a driver of sex-specific adaptive evolution. Based on accumulating literature on the life-history, phenotypic and ecological aspects of fecundity, we (i) suggest that  fecundity is restricted to refer to brood size per reproductive episode, while  annual and  lifetime fecundity should not be used interchangeably with  fecundity as they represent different life history parameters; (ii) provide a generalized redefinition of fecundity selection that encompasses any traits that influence fecundity in any direction (from high to low) and in either sex; (iii) review the (macro)ecological basis of fecundity selection (e.g., ecological pressures that influence predictable spatial variation in fecundity); (iv) suggest that most ecological theories of fecundity selection should be tested in organisms other than birds; (v) argue that the longstanding fecundity selection hypothesis of female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) has gained inconsistent support, that strong fecundity selection does not necessarily drive female-biased SSD, and that this form of SSD can be driven by other selective pressures; and (vi) discuss cases in which fecundity selection operates on males."
10.1101/015602,"The ability to sequence mitochondrial genomes quickly and cheaply has led to an explosion in available mtDNA data. As a result, an expanding literature is exploring links between mtDNA features and susceptibility to, or prevalence of, a range of diseases. Unfortunately, this great technological power has not always been accompanied by great statistical responsibility. I will focus on one aspect of statistical analysis, multiple hypothesis correction, that is absolutely required, yet often absolutely ignored, for responsible interpretation of this literature. Many existing studies perform comparisons between incidences of a large number (N) of different mtDNA features and a given disease, reporting all those yielding p-values under 0.05 as significant links. But when many comparisons are performed, it is highly likely that several p-values under 0.05 will emerge, by chance, in the absence of any underlying link. A suitable correction (for example, Bonferroni correction, requiring p < 0.05/N) must therefore be employed to avoid reporting false positive results. The absence of such corrections means that there is good reason to believe that many links reported between mtDNA features and various diseases are false; a state of affairs that is profoundly negative both for fundamental biology and for public health. I will show that statistics matching those claimed to illustrate significant links can arise, with a high probability, when no such link exists, and that these claims should thus be discarded until results of suitable statistical power are provided. I also discuss some strategies for responsible analysis and interpretation of this literature."
10.1101/015594,"In the early days of neuroimaging, brain function was investigated by averaging across voxels within a region, stimuli within a category and individuals within a group. These three forms of averaging discard important neuroscientific information. Recent studies have explored analyses that combine the evidence in better-motivated ways. Multivariate pattern analyses enable researchers to reveal representations in distributed population codes, honouring the unique information contributed by different voxels (or neurons). Condition-rich designs more richly sample the stimulus space and can treat each stimulus as a unique entity. Finally, each individuals brain is unique and recent studies have found ways to model and analyse the interindividual representational variability. Here we review our fields journey towards more sophisticated analyses that honour these important idiosyncrasies of brain representations. We describe an emerging framework for investigating individually unique pattern representations of particular stimuli in the brain. The framework models stimuli, responses and individuals multivariately and relates representations by means of representational dissimilarity matrices. Important components are computational models and multivariate descriptions of brain and behavioural responses. These recent developments promise a new paradigm for studying the individually unique brain at unprecedented levels of representational detail."

In this chapter we discuss the natural variation in climate/geography, genotypic and phenotypic diversity that exists within these species. We describe utilisation of this diversity via two methods, Genome Wide Association Studies and Landscape Genomics, to examine the interaction between specific genetic variants, phenotype, and environment. The aim is to identify adaptive loci that control specific traits in specific environments and understand the contribution of background polygenetic variation shaped by demographic processes. With recent developments in high throughput phenotyping, cheaper genotyping by sequencing and higher spatial/temporal resolution of climate data, these approaches can exploit the diversity of the Brachypodium. Experiments using this toolkit will reveal alleles, genes and pathways underlying agriculturally important and environmentally sensitive traits for use in grass breeding."
10.1101/015669,"In this report we present a multimarker association tool (Flash) based on a novel algorithm to generate haplotypes from raw genotype data. It belongs to the entropy minimization class of methods [4, 7] and is composed of a two stage deterministic - heuristic part and of a optional stochastic optimization. This algorithm is able to scale up well to handle huge datasets with faster performance than the competing technologies such as BEAGLE[5] and MACH[10] while maintaining a comparable accuracy. A quality assessment of the results is carried out by comparing the switch error. Finally, the haplotypes are used to perform a haplotype-based Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS). The association results are compared with a multimarker and a single SNP association test performed with Plink [12]. Our experiments confirm that the multimarker association test can be more powerful than the single SNP one as stated in the literature. Moreover, Flash and Plink show similar results for the multimarker association test but Flash speeds up the computation time of about an order of magnitude using 5 SNP size haplotypes."

10.1101/015685,"Adaptation lies at the heart of Darwinian evolution. Accordingly, numerous studies have tried to provide a formal framework for the description of the adaptive process. Out of these, two complementary modelling approaches have emerged: While so-called adaptive-walk models consider adaptation from the successive fixation of de-novo mutations only, quantitative genetic models assume that adaptation proceeds exclusively from pre-existing standing genetic variation. The latter approach, however, has focused on short-term evolution of population means and variances rather than on the statistical properties of adaptive substitutions. Our aim is to combine these two approaches by describing the ecological and genetic factors that determine the genetic basis of adaptation from standing genetic variation in terms of the effect-size distribution of individual alleles. Specifically, we consider the evolution of a quantitative trait to a gradually changing environment. By means of analytical approximations, we derive the distribution of adaptive substitutions from standing genetic variation, that is, the distribution of the phenotypic effects of those alleles from the standing variation that become fixed during adaptation. Our results are checked against individual-based simulations. We find that, compared to adaptation from de-novo mutations, (i) adaptation from standing variation proceeds by the fixation of more alleles of small effect; (ii) populations that adapt from standing genetic variation can traverse larger distances in phenotype space and, thus, have a higher potential for adaptation if the rate of environmental change is fast rather than slow."
10.1101/015719,"In cancer genomics, frequent recurrence of mutations in independent tumor samples is a strong indication of functional impact. However, rare functional mutations can escape detection by recurrence analysis for lack of statistical power. We address this problem by extending the notion of recurrence of mutations from single genes to gene families that share homologous protein domains. In addition to lowering the threshold of detection, this sharpens the functional interpretation of the impact of mutations, as protein domains more succinctly embody function than entire genes. Mapping mutations in 22 different tumor types to equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments of protein domains, we confirm well-known functional mutation hotspots and make two types of discoveries: 1) identification and functional interpretation of uncharacterized rare variants in one gene that are equivalent to well-characterized mutations in canonical cancer genes, such as uncharacterized ERBB4 (S303F) mutations that are analogous to canonical ERRB2 (S310F) mutations in the furin-like domain, and 2) detection of previously unknown mutation hotspots with novel functional implications. With the rapid expansion of cancer genomics projects, protein domain hotspot analysis is likely to provide many more leads linking mutations in proteins to the cancer phenotype."
10.1101/015651,"AbstractCurrent strategies to improve graft outcome following kidney transplantation consider information at the HLA loci. Here, we used exome sequencing of DNA from ABO compatible kidney graft recipients and their living donors to determine recipient and donor mismatches at the amino acid level over entire exomes. We estimated the number of amino acid mismatches in transmembrane proteins, more likely to be seen as foreign by the recipients immune system, and designated this tally as the allogenomics mismatch score (AMS). The AMS can be measured prior to transplantation with DNA for potential donor and recipient pairs. We examined the degree of relationship between the AMS and post-transplantation kidney allograft function by linear regression. In a discovery cohort, we found a significant inverse correlation between the AMS and kidney graft function at 36 months post-transplantation (n=10 recipient/donor pairs; 20 exomes) (r2>=0.57, P<0.05). The predictive ability of the AMS persists when the score is restricted to regions outside of the HLA loci. This relationship was validated using an independent cohort of 24 recipient donor pairs (n=48 exomes) (r2>=0.39, P<0.005). In an additional cohort of living and mostly intra-familial recipient/donor pairs (n=19, 38 exomes), we validated the association after controlling for donor age at time of transplantation. Finally, a model that controls for donor age, HLA mismatches and time post-transplantation yields a consistent AMS effect across these three independent cohorts (P<0.05). Taken together, these results show that the AMS is a strong predictor of long-term graft function in kidney transplant recipients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPrediction of long-term kidney graft function with exome sequencing"
10.1101/015693,"Describing the process of spontaneous mutation is fundamental for understanding the genetic basis of disease, the threat posed by declining population size in conservation biology, and in much evolutionary biology. However, directly studying spontaneous mutation is difficult because of the rarity of de novo mutations. Mutation accumulation (MA) experiments overcome this by allowing mutations to build up over many generations in the near absence of natural selection. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of 85 MA lines derived from six genetically diverse wild strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We identified 6,843 spontaneous mutations, more than any other study of spontaneous mutation. We observed seven-fold variation in the mutation rate among strains and that mutator genotypes arose, increasing the mutation rate dramatically in some replicates. We also found evidence for fine-scale heterogeneity in the mutation rate, driven largely by the sequence flanking mutated sites, and by clusters of multiple mutations at closely linked sites. There was little evidence, however, for mutation rate heterogeneity between chromosomes or over large genomic regions of 200Kbp. Using logistic regression, we generated a predictive model of the mutability of sites based on their genomic properties, including local GC content, gene expression level and local sequence context. Our model accurately predicted the average mutation rate and natural levels of genetic diversity of sites across the genome. Notably, trinucleotides vary 17-fold in rate between the most mutable and least mutable sites. Our results uncover a rich heterogeneity in the process of spontaneous mutation both among individuals and across the genome."
10.1101/015677,"Ketamine produces schizophrenia-like behavioral phenotypes in healthy people. Prolonged ketamine effects and exacerbation of symptoms were observed in schizophrenia patients after administration of ketamine. More recently, ketamine has been used as a potent antidepressant to treat patients with major depression. The genes and neurons that regulate behavioral responses to ketamine, however, remain poorly understood. Our previous studies found that Sp4 hypomorphic mice displayed several behavioral phenotypes relevant to psychiatric disorders, consistent with human SP4 gene associations with schizophrenia, bipolar, and major depression. Among those behavioral phenotypes, hypersensitivity to ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion has been observed in Sp4 hypomorphic mice. Here, we report differential genetic restoration of Sp4 expression in forebrain excitatory neurons or GABAergic neurons in Sp4 hypomorphic mice and the effects of these restorations on different behavioral phenotypes. Restoration of Sp4 in forebrain excitatory neurons did not rescue deficient sensorimotor gating, fear learning, or ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Restoration of Sp4 in forebrain GABAergic neurons, however, rescued ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion, but did not rescue deficient sensorimotor gating or fear learning. Our studies suggest that the Sp4 gene in forebrain GABAergic neurons plays an essential role in regulating some behavioral responses to ketamine."
10.1101/015743,"The evolutionary forces that maintain genetic variation for quantitative traits within populations remain poorly understood. One hypothesis suggests that variation is maintained by a balance between new mutations and their removal by selection and drift. Theory predicts that this mutation-selection balance will result in an excess of low-frequency variants and a negative correlation between minor allele frequency and selection coefficients. Here, we test these predictions using the genetic loci associated with total expression variation (eQTLs) and allele-specific expression variation (aseQTLs) mapped within a single population of the plant Capsella grandiflora. In addition to finding eQTLs and aseQTLs for a large fraction of genes, we show that alleles at these loci are rarer than expected and exhibit a negative correlation between phenotypic effect size and frequency. Overall, our results show that the distribution of frequencies and effect sizes of the loci responsible for local expression variation within a single, outcrossing population are consistent with mutation-selection balance.\n\nSignificanceBiologists have long sought to explain why we see genetic variation for traits in populations despite the expectation that selection will remove most variation. We address this question by using gene expression as a model trait and identifying the genetic loci that affect gene expression in a single, large population of the plant Capsella grandiflora. Alleles at loci that affect expression were rarer than expected by chance and there was a negative correlation between phenotypic effect size and frequency of these alleles. These observations are consistent with mutation-selection balance, the hypothesis that variation is maintained by a balance between new mutations and their removal by selection and drift."
10.1101/015727,"We introduce Phen-Gen, a method which combines patients disease symptoms and sequencing data with prior domain knowledge to identify the causative gene(s) for rare disorders. Simulations reveal that the causal variant is ranked first in 88% cases when it is coding; which is 52% advantage over a genotype-only approach and outperforms existing methods by 13-58%. If disease etiology is unknown, the causal variant is assigned top-rank in 71% of simulations."
10.1101/015784,"Tandem repeats (TR) are stretches of DNA that are highly variable in length and mutate rapidly, and thus an important source of genetic variation. This variation is highly informative for population and conservation genetics, and has also been associated with several pathological conditions and with gene expression regulation. However, genome-wide surveys of TR variation have been scarce due to the technical difficulties derived from short-read technology.\n\nHere, we explored the genome-wide diversity of TRs in a panel of 83 human and nonhuman great ape genomes, and their impact on gene expression evolution. We found that populations and species diversity patterns can be efficiently captured with short TRs (repeat unit length 1-5 base pairs) with potential applications in conservation genetics. We also examined the potential evolutionary role of TRs in gene expression differences between humans and primates by using 30,275 larger TRs (repeat unit length 2-50 base pairs). About one third of the 13,035 one-to-one orthologous genes contained TRs within 5 kilobase pairs of their transcription start site, and had higher expression divergence than genes without such TRs. The same observation held for genes with repeats in their 3 untranslated region, in introns, and in exons. Using our polymorphism data for the shortest TRs, we found that genes with polymorphic repeats in their promoters showed higher expression divergence in humans and chimpanzees compared to genes with fixed or no TRs in the promoters. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of TRs to recent human evolution through gene regulation."
10.1101/015750,"ObjectiveBrain-machine interfaces (BMIs) seek to enable people with movement disabilities to directly control prosthetic systems with their neural activity. Current high performance BMIs are driven by action potentials (spikes), but access to this signal often diminishes as sensors degrade over time. Decoding local field potentials (LFPs) as an alternative or complementary BMI control signal may improve performance when there is a paucity of spike signals. To date only a small handful of LFP decoding methods have been tested online; there remains a need to test different LFP decoding approaches and improve LFP-driven performance. There has also not been a reported demonstration of a hybrid BMI that decodes kinematics from both LFP and spikes. Here we first evaluate a BMI driven by the local motor potential (LMP), a low-pass filtered time-domain LFP amplitude feature. We then combine decoding of both LMP and spikes to implement a hybrid BMI.\n\nApproachSpikes and LFP were recorded from two macaques implanted with multielectrode arrays in primary and premotor cortex while they performed a reaching task. We then evaluated closed-loop BMI control using biomimetic decoders driven by LMP, spikes, or both signals together.\n\nMain ResultsLMP decoding enabled quick and accurate cursor control which surpassed previously reported LFP BMI performance. Hybrid decoding of both spikes and LMP improved performance when spikes signal quality was mediocre to poor.\n\nSignificanceThese findings show that LMP is an effective BMI control signal which requires minimal power to extract and can substitute for or augment impoverished spikes signals. Use of this signal may lengthen the useful lifespan of BMIs and is therefore an important step towards clinically viable BMIs.\n\nSuggested PACS 87.19.L-Neuroscience\n87.19.lu motor systems\n87.19.rs Movement\n87.19.R-Mechanical and electrical properties of tissues and organs\n87.85.E-Neural Prosthetics\n87.85.Wc Neural engineering\n87.85.dd brain-machine interface\n87.85.Ng Biological signal processing\n\n\nIOP Subjects Medical Physics, Biological Physics"
10.1101/015792,"The molecular reaction networks that coordinate the response of an organism to changing environmental conditions are central for survival and reproduction. Escherchia coli employs an accurate and flexible signalling system that is capable of processing ambient nitrogen availability rapidly and with high accuracy. Carefully orchestrated post-translational modifications of PII and the glutamine synthetase allow E. coli to trace nitrogen availability in a continuous, decidedly non-digital fashion. We measure the dynamic proteomic and metabolomic responses to trace the analog computations, and use an information theoretical framework to characterize the information capacity of E. colis nitrogen sensing network: we find that this system can transmit up to 9bits of information about the nitrogen state. This allows cells to respond rapidly and accurately even to small differences in metabolite concentrations."
10.1101/015776,"BackgroundThe detailed analysis of transcriptional regulation is crucially important for understanding biological processes. The gap gene network in Drosophila attracts large interest among researches studying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. It implements the most upstream regulatory layer of the segmentation gene network. The knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in gap gene regulation is far less complete than that of genetics of the system. Mathematical modeling goes beyond insights gained by genetics and molecular approaches. It allows us to reconstruct wild-type gene expression patterns in silico, infer underlying regulatory mechanism and prove its sufficiency.\n\nResultsWe developed a new model that provides a dynamical description of gap gene regulatory systems, using detailed DNA-based information, as well as spatial transcription factor concentration data at varying time points. We showed that this model correctly reproduces gap gene expression patterns in wild type embryos and is able to predict gap expression patterns in Kr mutants and four reporter constructs. We used four-fold cross validation test and fitting to random dataset to validate the model and proof its sufficiency in data description. The identifiability analysis showed that most model parameters are well identifiable. We reconstructed the gap gene network topology and studied the impact of individual transcription factor binding sites on the model output. We measured this impact by calculating the site regulatory weight as a normalized difference between the residual sum of squares error for the set of all annotated sites and the set, from which the site of interest was left out.\n\nConclusionsThe reconstructed topology of the gap gene network is in agreement with previous modeling results and data from literature. We showed that 1) the regulatory weights of transcription factor binding sites show very weak correlation with their PWM score; 2) sites with low regulatory weight are important for the model output; 3) functional important sites are not exclusively located in cis-regulatory elements, but are rather dispersed through regulatory region. It is of importance that some of the sites with high functional impact in hb, Kr and kni regulatory regions coincide with strong sites annotated and verified in Dnase I footprint assays."
10.1101/015826,"In developing embryos of eukaryotes, varying concentrations and/or duration of exposure to morphogens induce and repress transcription factors (TFs) in a regular order, thereby acting as signals for cell differentiation. I present a chemical thermodynamic model for the formation and degradation of the morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the major TFs involved in dorsal-ventral patterning of the vertebrate neural tube. This two-stage model first considers introduction of Shh into a chemically defined (oxidizing) environment. As the system is driven away from metastable equilibrium, the TFs progressively become more stable than Shh, as indicated by comparison of the calculated overall energies of formation (chemical affinity). In the second stage, a gradual return to metastable equilibrium with Shh drives transitions in the relative stabilities of the TFs that follow the experimental patterns of TF expression. At the intracellular level, the major proteins in the signal transduction network show a metastability progression among reactions of Shh and its cell-surface receptor and the intracellular Gli proteins that act as activators and repressors of transcription. If the endocytosis and degradation of receptor-ligand complexes are coupled to localized protein translation, the consequent thermodynamic constraints may represent a high-level source of specificity that coexists with molecular mechanisms of signal transduction."
10.1101/015818,"The brown rat, Rattus norvegicus, is both a notorious pest and a frequently used model in biomedical research. By analysing genome sequences of 12 wild-caught brown rats from their ancestral range in NE China, along with the sequence of a black rat, R. rattus, we investigate the selective and demographic forces shaping variation in the genome. We estimate that the recent effective population size (Ne) of this species = 1.24 x 105, based on silent site diversity. We compare patterns of diversity in these genomes with patterns in multiple genome sequences of the house mouse (Mus musculus castaneus), which has a much larger Ne. This reveals an important role for variation in the strength of genetic drift in mammalian genome evolution. By a Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) analysis of demographic history, we infer that there has been a recent population size bottleneck in wild rats, which we date to approximately 20,000 years ago. Consistent with this, wild rat populations have experienced an increased flux of mildly deleterious mutations, which segregate at higher frequencies in protein-coding genes and conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). This leads to negative estimates of the rate of adaptive evolution () in proteins and CNEs, a result which we discuss in relation to the strongly positive estimates observed in wild house mice. As a consequence of the population bottleneck, wild rats also show a markedly slower decay of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance than wild house mice."
10.1101/015800,"Documenting the full extent of gene flow during speciation poses a challenge, as species ranges change over time and current rates of hybridisation might not reflect historical trends. Theoretical work has emphasized the potential for speciation in the face of ongoing hybridisation, and the genetic mechanisms that might facilitate this process. However, elucidating how the rate of gene flow between species may have changed over time has proved difficult. Here we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit a model of speciation between the Neotropical butterflies Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno. These species are ecologically divergent, rarely hybridize and display female hybrid sterility. Nevertheless, previous genomic studies suggests pervasive gene flow between them, extending deep into their past, and potentially throughout the speciation process. By modelling the rates of gene flow during early and later stages of speciation, we find that these species have been hybridising for hundreds of thousands of years, but have not done so continuously since their initial divergence. Instead, it appears that gene flow was rare or absent for as long as a million years in the early stages of speciation. Therefore, by dissecting the timing of gene flow between these species, we are able to reject a scenario of purely sympatric speciation in the face of continuous gene flow. We suggest that the period of minimal contact early in speciation may have allowed for the accumulation of genomic changes that later enabled these species to remain distinct despite a dramatic increase in the rate of hybridisation."
10.1101/015875,"STR, short trandem repeats, is well known as a type of powerful genetic marker and widely used in studying human population genetics. Compared with the conventional genetic markers, the mutation rate of STR is higher. Additionally, the mutations of STR loci do not lead to genetic inconsistencies between the genotypes of parents and children; therefore, the analysis of STR mutation is more suited to assess the population mutation. In this study, we focused on 15 autosomal STR loci (D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSF1PO, D3S1358, TH01, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D19S433, vWA, TPOX, D18S51, D5S818, FGA). DNA samples from a total of 42416 unrelated healthy individuals (19037 trios) from the population of Mainland China collected between Jan 2012 and May 2014 were successfully investigated. In our study, the allele frequencies, paternal mutation rates, maternal mutation rates and average mutation rates were detected in the 15 STR loci. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationship between paternal ages, maternal ages, pregnant time, area and average mutation rate. We found that paternal mutation rate is higher than maternal mutation rate and the paternal, maternal, and average mutation rates have a positive correlation with paternal ages, maternal ages and times respectively. Additionally, the average mutation rates of coastal areas are higher than that of inland areas. Overall, these results suggest that the 15 autosomal STR loci can provide highly informative polymorphic data for population genetic assessment in Mainland China, as well as confirm and extend the application of STR analysis in population genetics."
10.1101/015859,"Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk, and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves LD-pruning markers and applying a P-value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and may reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce a new method, LDpred, which infers the posterior mean causal effect size of each marker using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the pruning/thresholding approach, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, prediction R2 increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia data set and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis data set. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease data sets and when predicting in non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase."
10.1101/015867,"SummaryLarge resequencing projects require a significant amount of storage for raw sequences, as well as alignment files. Since the raw sequences are redundant once the alignment has been generated, it is possible to keep only the alignment files. We present BamHash, a checksum based method to ensure that the read pairs in FASTQ files match exactly the read pairs stored in BAM files, regardless of the ordering of reads. BamHash can be used to verify the integrity of the files stored and discover any discrepancies. Thus, BamHash can be used to determine if it is safe to delete the FASTQ files storing raw sequencing reads after alignment, without the loss of data.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed and available at https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/BamHash\n\nContactpmelsted@hi.is"
10.1101/015883,"Despite their critical importance in maintaining the integrity of all cellular pathways, the specific role of mutations on protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces as cancer drivers, though known for some specific examples, has not been systematically studied. We analyzed missense somatic mutations in a pan-cancer cohort of 5,989 tumors from 23 projects of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for enrichment on PPI interfaces using e-Driver, an algorithm to analyze the mutation pattern of specific protein regions such as PPI interfaces. We identified 128 PPI interfaces enriched in somatic cancer mutations. Our results support the notion that many mutations in well-established cancer driver genes, particularly those in critical network positions, act by altering PPI interfaces. Finally, focusing on individual interfaces we are also able to show how tumors driven by the same gene can have different behaviors, including patient outcomes, depending on whether specific interfaces are mutated or not."
10.1101/015917,"Much recent debate has focused on the role of rare variants in complex phenotypes. However, it is well known that rare alleles can only contribute a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance when they have much larger effect sizes than common variants, which is most easily explained by natural selection constraining trait-altering alleles to low frequency. It is also plausible that demographic events will influence the genetic architecture of complex traits. Unfortunately, most rare variant association tests do not explicitly model natural selection or non-equilibrium demography. Here, we develop a novel evolutionary model of complex traits. We perform numerical calculations and simulate phenotypes under this model using inferred human demographic and selection parameters. We show that rare variants only contribute substantially to complex traits under very strong assumptions about the relationship between effect size and selection strength. We then assess the performance of state-of-the-art rare variant tests using our simulations across a broad range of model parameters. Counterintuitively, we find that statistical power is lowest when rare variants make the greatest contribution to the additive variance, and that power is substantially lower under our model than previously studied models. While many empirical studies have attempted to identify causal loci using rare variant association methods, few have reported novel associations. Some authors have interpreted this to mean that rare variants contribute little to heritability, but our results show that an alternative explanation is that rare variant tests have less power than previously estimated."
10.1101/015909,"We have fully sequenced the genome of an individual from the region of Saudi Arabia. In order to facilitate comparative analysis, an initial characterization of the new genome was undertaken based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The SNP data having associated population statistics, essentially the HapMap, served to identify features that were rare by comparison. Methods were developed and applied to tag observed SNPs as different and were extended to identify strings or clusters of difference in the individual relative to comparison populations to effectively increase the significance over single SNP comparison. Difference strings identified in the individual relative to each comparison population showed a genome location pattern with various levels of overlap between the comparison populations. The SNP frequencies from the HapMap population samples Ceu and Yri showed a difference inversion relative to the sample genome. The total SNP difference count was greatest between the individual and the Yri population sample while the number and total span of SNP difference clusters was greatest in comparison with the Ceu population sample. The final pattern of difference clusters has served to define distinctive features in the individual genome toward preliminary characterization."
10.1101/015891,"The cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling is a broad specificity pathway that plays important roles in the transduction of environmental signals triggering precise physiological responses. cAMP-signal transduction specificity is achieved and controlled at several levels. The Saccharomyces cereviciae PKA holoenzyme consists of two catalytic subunits encoded by TPK1, TPK2 and TPK3 genes, and two regulatory subunits encoded by BCY1 gene. In this work we studied the activity of these gene promoters using a reporter-synthetic genetic array screen, with the goal of identifying novel regulators of PKA subunits expression. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the regulators identified showed that these regulators were enriched for annotations associated with roles in several GO biological process, as lipid and phosphate metabolism or transcription regulation and regulate all or some of the four promoters. Further characterization of the effect of these pathways on promoter activity and mRNA levels pointed to inositol, inositol polyphosphates, choline and phosphate as novel upstream signals that regulate transcription of PKA subunit genes. In addition, within each category there are genes that regulate only one of the promoters and genes that regulate more than one of them at the same time. These results support the role of transcription regulation of each PKA subunit in cAMP specificity signaling. Interestingly, many of the known targets of PKA phosphorylation are associated with the identified pathways, opening the possibility of a reciprocal regulation in which PKA would be coordinating different metabolic pathways and these processes would in turn, regulate expression of the kinase subunits."
10.1101/015925,"AbstractWe present a, mathematical model driven, framework to implement virtual or imaginary clinical trials (phase i trials) that can be used to bridge the gap between preclinical studies and the clinic. The trial implementation process includes the development of an experimentally validated mathematical model, generation of a cohort of heterogeneous virtual patients, an assessment of stratification factors, and optimization of treatment strategy. We show the detailed process through application to melanoma treatment, using a combination therapy of chemotherapy and an AKT inhibitor, which was recently tested in a phase 1 clinical trial. We developed a mathematical model, composed of ordinary differential equations, based on experimental data showing that such therapies differentially induce autophagy in melanoma cells. Model parameters were estimated using an optimization algorithm that minimizes differences between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The calibrated model was validated by comparing predicted cell populations with experimentally measured melanoma cell populations in twelve different treatment scheduling conditions. By using this validated model as the foundation for a genetic algorithm, we generated a cohort of virtual patients that mimics the heterogeneous combination therapy responses observed in a companion clinical trial. Sensitivity analysis of this cohort defined parameters that discriminated virtual patients having more favorable versus less favorable outcomes. Finally, the model predicts optimal therapeutic approaches across all virtual patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe propose a computational framework to implement phase i trials (virtual/imaginary yet informed clinical trials) in cancer, using an experimentally calibrated mathematical model of melanoma combination therapy, that can readily capture observed heterogeneous clinical outcomes and be used to optimize future clinical trial design."
10.1101/015958,"A novel crossmodal matching paradigm including vision, audition, and somatosensation was developed in order to investigate the interaction between attention and crossmodal congruence in multisensory integration. To that end, all three modalities were stimulated concurrently while a bimodal focus was defined blockwise. Congruence between stimulus intensity changes in the attended modalities had to be evaluated. We found that crossmodal congruence improved performance if both, the attended modalities and the task-irrelevant distractor were congruent. If the attended modalities were incongruent, the distractor impaired performance due to its congruence relation to one of the attended modalities. Between attentional conditions, magnitudes of crossmodal enhancement or impairment differed. Largest crossmodal effects were seen in visual-tactile matching, intermediate effects for audio-visual and smallest effects for audio-tactile matching. We conclude that differences in crossmodal matching likely reflect characteristics of multisensory neural network architecture. We discuss our results with respect to the timing of perceptual processing and state hypotheses for future physiological studies. Finally, etiological questions are addressed."
10.1101/015834,"Recently, psychophysical laws have been observed to be functional in certain factors working downstream of the Wnt pathway. This work tests the veracity of the prevalence of such laws, albeit at a coarse level, using sensitivity analysis on biologically inspired epigenetically influenced computational causal models. In this work, the variation in the effect of the predictive behaviour of the transcription complex (TRCMPLX) conditional on the evidences of gene expressions in normal/tumor samples is observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Preliminary analysis shows that the variation in predictive behaviour of TRCMPLX follows power-logarithmic psychophysical law, crudely. More recently, wet lab experiments have proved the existence of sensors that behave in a logarithmic fashion thus supporting the earlier proposed postulates based on computational sensitivity analysis of this manuscript regarding the existence of logarithmic behaviour in the signaling pathways. It also signifies the importance of systems biology approach where in silico experiments combined with in vivo/in vitro experiments have the power to explore the deeper mechanisms of a signaling pathway. Additionally, it is hypothesized that these laws are prevalent at gene-gene interaction level also. The interactions were obtained by thresholding the inferred conditional probabilities of a gene activation given the status of another gene activation. The deviation in the interactions in normal/tumor samples was similarly observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Analysis of deviation in interactions show prevalence of psychophysical laws and is reported for interaction between elements of pairs (SFRP3, MYC), (SFRP2, CD44) and (DKK1, DACT2). Based on crude static models, it is assumed that dynamic models of Bayesian networks might reveal the phenomena in a better way."
10.1101/015966,"DNA methylation is a key regulatory mechanism in mammalian genomes. Despite the increasing knowledge about this epigenetic modification, the understanding of human epigenome evolution is in its infancy. We used whole genome bisulfite sequencing to study DNA methylation and nucleotide divergence between human and great apes. We identified 360 and 210 differentially hypo- and hypermethylated regions (DMRs) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that 20% and 36% of these regions, respectively, were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human DMRs were enriched for specific histone modifications and contrary to expectations, the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated regions suggesting their association with local epigenetic changes.\n\nWe also reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human DMRs, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific DNA methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman and great apes, their closest living relatives, differ in numerous morphological and cognitive aspects, however their protein sequences are highly similar. It has long been hypothesized that human specific traits may be explained by changes in regulatory elements rather than by changes in primary sequence. In this context, evolutionary biologists have identified regulatory regions based on nucleotide sequence acceleration or conservation. However, epigenetics adds an extra layer of information that cannot be detected when comparing DNA sequences. The current study provides one of the first genome-wide comparison of genetic and epigenetic variation among humans and our closest living relatives. We identify and describe hundreds of regions presenting a human-specific DNA methylation pattern compared to great apes. We also report a local interplay between DNA methylation changes and the underlying nucleotide sequence in regions of incomplete lineage sorting and in regions of transcription factor binding, suggesting that both phenomena are closely associated."
10.1101/016006,"A major challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand the origins of novel structures. The wing patterns of butterflies and moths are derived phenotypes unique to the Lepidoptera. Here we identify a gene that we name poikilomousa (poik), which regulates colour pattern switches in the mimetic Heliconius butterflies. Strong associations between phenotypic variation and DNA sequence variation are seen in three different Heliconius species, in addition to associations between gene expression and colour pattern. Colour pattern variants are also associated with differences in splicing of poik transcripts. poik is a member of the conserved fizzy family of cell cycle regulators. It belongs to a faster evolving subfamily, the closest functionally characterised orthologue being the cortex gene in Drosophila, a female germ-line specific protein involved in meiosis. poik appears to have adopted a novel function in the Lepidoptera and become a major target for natural selection acting on colour and pattern variation in this group."

In Arabidopsis, euchromatic TEs are targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Conversely, active DNA demethylation prevents accumulation of methylation at genes proximal to these TEs. It is unknown how a cellular balance between methylation and demethylation activities is achieved. Here we show that both RdDM and DNA demethylation are highly active at a TE proximal to the major DNA demethylase gene ROS1. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to most other genomic targets, expression of ROS1 is promoted by DNA methylation and antagonized by DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that inducing methylation of the ROS1 proximal region is sufficient to restore ROS1 expression in an RdDM mutant. Additionally, methylation-sensitive expression of ROS1 is conserved in other species, suggesting it is adaptive. We propose that the ROS1 locus functions as an epigenetic rheostat, tuning the level of demethylase activity in response to methylation alterations, thus ensuring epigenomic stability.\n\nAuthor SummaryOrganisms must adapt to dynamic and variable internal and external environments. Maintaining homeostasis in core biological processes is crucial to minimizing the deleterious consequences of environmental fluctuations. Genomes are also dynamic and variable, and must be robust against stresses, including the invasion of genomic parasites, such as transposable elements (TEs). In this work we present the discovery of an epigenetic rheostat in plants that maintains homeostasis in levels of DNA methylation. DNA methylation typically silences transcription of TEs. Because there is positive feedback between existing and de novo DNA methylation, it is critical that methylation is not allowed to spread and potentially silence transcription of genes. To maintain homeostasis, methylation promotes the production of a demethylase enzyme that removes methylation from gene-proximal regions. The demethylation of genes is therefore always maintained in concert with the levels of methylation suppressing TEs. In addition, this DNA demethylating enzyme also represses its own production in a negative feedback loop. Together, these feedback mechanisms shed new light into how the conflict between gene expression and genome defense is maintained in homeostasis. The presence of this rheostat in multiple species suggests it is an evolutionary conserved adaptation."
10.1101/016022,"DNA methylation is thought to be robust to environmental perturbations on a short time scale. Here, we challenge that view by demonstrating that the infection of human dendritic cells (DCs) with a pathogenic bacteria is associated with rapid changes in methylation at thousands of loci. Infection-induced changes in methylation occur primarily at distal enhancer elements, including those associated with the activation of key immune-transcription factors and genes involved in the crosstalk between DCs and adaptive immunity. Active demethylation is associated with extensive epigenetic remodeling and is strongly predictive of changes in the expression levels of nearby genes. Collectively, our observations show that rapid changes in methylation play a previously unappreciated role in regulating the transcriptional response of DCs to infection."
10.1101/015974,"Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) forms a membranous network that extends throughout neurons. SER regulates intracellular calcium and the posttranslational modification and trafficking of membrane and proteins. As the structure of dendritic SER shifts from a tubular to a more complex, branched form, the movement of membrane cargo slows and delivery to nearby spines increases. Here we discovered changes in the structural complexity of SER that have important functional implications during long-term potentiation (LTP) in adult rat hippocampus. By 2 hours after the induction of LTP with theta-burst stimulation, synapse enlargement was greatest on spines that contained SER. More spines had an elaborate spine apparatus than a simple tubule of SER. The SER in dendritic shafts became more complex beneath spines with both polyribosomes and SER, and less complex along aspiny dendritic regions. The findings suggest that local changes in dendritic SER support enhanced growth of specific synapses during LTP."
10.1101/016089,"Graphical representation of DNA sequences is one of the most popular techniques of alignment-free sequence comparison. In this article, we propose a new method for extracting features of DNA sequences represented by binary images, in which we estimate the similarity between DNA sequences by the frequency histograms of local bitmap patterns on the images. Our method has linear time complexity for the length of DNA sequences, which is practical even for comparison of long sequences. We tested five distance measures to estimate sequence similarities and found that histogram intersection and Manhattan distance are most appropriate for our method among them."
10.1101/016030,"Mechanisms that coordinate the growth of different tissues during development are essential for producing adult animals with proper organ proportion. Here we describe a pathway through which tissues communicate with each other to coordinate growth. During Drosophila melanogaster larval development, damage to imaginal discs activates a regeneration checkpoint that produces both a delay in developmental timing and slows the growth of undamaged tissues, coordinating regeneration of the damaged tissue with developmental progression and overall growth. Both developmental delay and growth control are mediated by secretion of the insulin/relaxin family peptide Dilp8 from regenerating tissues. Here we demonstrate that Dilp8-dependent growth coordination between regenerating and undamaged tissues, but not developmental delay, requires the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the prothoracic gland. NOS limits the growth of undamaged tissues by reducing ecdysone biosynthesis, a requirement for imaginal disc growth during both the regenerative checkpoint and normal development. Therefore, NOS activity in the prothoracic gland translates information about the growth status of individual tissues into coordinated tissue growth through the regulation of endocrine signals."
10.1101/016105,"Background: Measures of population-level influenza severity are important for public health planning, but estimates are often based on case-fatality and case-hospitalization risks, which require multiple data sources, are prone to surveillance biases, and are typically unavailable in the early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we develop a severity index based on influenza age dynamics estimated from routine surveillance data that can be used in retrospective and early warning contexts.\n\nMethods and Findings: Our method relies on the observation that age-specific attack rates vary between seasons, so that key features of the age distribution of cases may be used as a marker of severity early in an epidemic. We illustrate our method using weekly outpatient medical claims of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States from the 2001 to 2009 and develop a novel population-level influenza severity index based on the relative risk of ILI among working-age adults to that among school-aged children. We validate our ILI index against a benchmark that comprises traditional influenza severity indicators such as viral activity, hospitalizations and deaths using publicly available surveillance data. We find that severe influenza seasons have higher relative rates of ILI among adults than mild seasons. In reference to the benchmark, the ILI index is a robust indicator of severity during the period of peak epidemic growth (87.5% accuracy in retrospective classification), and may have predictive power during the period between Thanksgiving and the winter holidays (57.1% accuracy in early warning). We further apply our approach at the state-level to characterize regional severity patterns across seasons. We hypothesize that our index is a proxy for severity because working-age adults have both pre-existing immunity to influenza and a high number of contacts, infecting them preferentially in severe seasons associated with antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses. Our analysis is limited by its application to seasonal influenza epidemics and a relatively short study period.\n\nConclusions: Our severity index and research on the link between age dynamics and seasonal influenza severity will enable decision makers to better target public health strategies in severe seasons and improve our knowledge of influenza epidemiology and population impact. These findings demonstrate that routine surveillance data can be translated into operational information for policymakers. Our study also highlights the need for further research on the putative age-related mechanisms of severity in seasonal and pandemic influenza seasons."
10.1101/016121,"In order to characterize the dynamics of adaptation, it is important to be able to quantify how a populations mean fitness changes over time. Such measurements are especially important in experimental studies of evolution using microbes. The Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli provides one such system in which mean fitness has been measured by competing derived and ancestral populations. The traditional method used to measure fitness in the LTEE and many similar experiments, though, is subject to a potential limitation. As the relative fitness of the two competitors diverges, the measurement error increases because the less-fit population becomes increasingly small and cannot be enumerated as precisely. Here, we present and employ two alternatives to the traditional method. One is based on reducing the fitness differential between the competitors by using a common reference competitor from an intermediate generation that has intermediate fitness; the other alternative increases the initial population size of the less-fit, ancestral competitor. We performed a total of 480 competitions to compare the statistical properties of estimates obtained using these alternative methods with those obtained using the traditional method for samples taken over 50,000 generations from one of the LTEE populations. On balance, neither alternative method yielded measurements that were more precise than the traditional method."
10.1101/016097,"Allelic expression (AE) analysis has become an important tool for integrating genome and transcriptome data to characterize various biological phenomena such as cis-regulatory variation and nonsense-mediated decay. In this paper, we systematically analyze the properties of AE read count data and technical sources of error, such as low-quality or double-counted RNA-seq reads, genotyping errors, allelic mapping bias, and technical covariates due to sample preparation and sequencing, and variation in total read depth. We provide guidelines for correcting and filtering for such errors, and show that the resulting AE data has extremely low technical noise. Finally, we introduce novel software for high-throughput production of AE data from RNA-sequencing data, implemented in the GATK framework. These improved tools and best practices for AE analysis yield higher quality AE data by reducing technical bias. This provides a practical framework for wider adoption of AE analysis by the genomics community."
10.1101/016196,"BackgroundRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool for genome-wide expression profiling of biological samples with the advantage of high-throughput and high resolution. There are many existing algorithms nowadays for quantifying expression levels and detecting differential gene expression, but none of them takes the misaligned reads that are mapped to non-exonic regions into account. We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution. Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals, assuming governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the accurate detection of differential expressed genes.\n\nResultsWe implemented our novel XBSeq algorithm and evaluated it by using a set of simulated expression datasets under different conditions, using a combination of negative binomial and Poisson distributions with parameters derived from real RNA-seq data. We compared the performance of our method with other commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms. We also evaluated the changes in true and false positive rates with variations in biological replicates, differential fold changes, and expression levels in non-exonic regions. We also tested the algorithm on a set of real RNA-seq data where the common and different detection results from different algorithms were reported.\n\nConclusionsIn this paper, we proposed a novel XBSeq, a differential expression analysis algorithm for RNA-seq data that takes non-exonic mapped reads into consideration. When background noise is at baseline level, the performance of XBSeq and DESeq are mostly equivalent. However, our method surpasses DESeq and other algorithms with the increase of non-exonic mapped reads. Only in very low read count condition XBSeq had a slightly higher false discovery rate, which may be improved by adjusting the background noise effect in this situation. Taken together, by considering non-exonic mapped reads, XBSeq can provide accurate expression measurement and thus detect differential expressed genes even in noisy conditions."
10.1101/016139,"The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) directs programmed destruction of key cellular regulators via post-translational modification of its targets with polyubiquitin chains. These commonly contain Lysine 48 (K48)-directed ubiquitin linkages, but chains containing atypical Lysine 11 (K11) linkages also target substrates to the proteasome, for example to regulate cell cycle progression. A single ubiquitin ligase, the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), controls mitotic exit. In higher eukaryotes, the APC/C works with the E2 enzyme UBE2S to assemble K11 linkages in cells released from mitotic arrest, and these are proposed to constitute an improved proteolytic signal during exit from mitosis. We have tested this idea by correlating quantitative measures of in vivo K11-specific ubiquitination of individual substrates, including Aurora kinases, with their degradation kinetics tracked at the single cell level. We report that all anaphase substrates tested by this methodology are stabilized by depletion of K11 linkages via UBE2S knockdown, even if the same substrates are significantly modified with K48-linked polyubiquitin. Specific examination of substrates depending on the APC/C coactivator Cdh1 for their degradation revealed Cdh1-dependent enrichment of K11 chains on these substrates, while other ubiquitin linkages on the same substrates added during mitotic exit were Cdh1-independent. Therefore we show that K11 linkages provide the APC/C with a means to regulate the rate of substrate degradation in a co-activator-specified manner.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/013961,"Our group has published a study on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming (Rais et al. Nature 20131) that reached the following conclusions: a) Mbd3/NuRD is a repressor of inducing naive pluripotency from mouse Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), primordial germ cells (PGCs), murine somatic cells and human secondary fibroblasts; b) Up to 100% iPSC formation efficiency can be achieved via optimized Mbd3/NuRD depletion, in concert with optimized OKSM delivery and naive pluripotency conditions (2i supplement applied only after 48 hours, human LIF, hypoxia and Vitamin C containing Knockout serum replacement)1. This represented the first proof for deterministic/near-deterministic iPSC reprogramming, and highlighted a previously unappreciated role for Mbd3/NuRD in hampering the re-establishment of pluripotency. Recent reports have seemingly provided contradictory results and attempted to dispute our iPSC efficiency quantifications and/or the role of Mbd3/NuRD in blocking reprogramming2,3. Here we provide a detailed response to these reports based on extended discussions and providing new data. The synthesis presented herein disagrees with claims made by Silva, Hendrich, Bertone and colleagues2,3, and reconfirms that Mbd3/NuRD is a major pathway that inhibits the maintenance and induction of pluripotency1. Further, we foresee that its controlled manipulation is likely to become an integral pathway for inducing and maintaining naive pluripotency in a variety of species."
10.1101/016063,"Visualizing read alignments is the most effective way to validate candidate SVs with existing data. We present svviz, a sequencing read visualizer for structural variants (SVs) that sorts and displays only reads relevant to a candidate SV. svviz works by searching input bam(s) for potentially relevant reads, realigning them against the inferred sequence of the putative variant allele as well as the reference allele, and identifying reads that match one allele better than the other. Reads are assigned to the proper allele based on alignment score, read pair orientation and insert size. Separate views of the two alleles are then displayed in a scrollable web browser view, enabling a more intuitive visualization of each allele, compared to the single reference genome-based view common to most current read browsers. The web view facilitates examining the evidence for or against a putative variant, estimating zygosity, visualizing affected genomic annotations, and manual refinement of breakpoints. An optional command-line-only interface allows summary statistics and graphics to be exported directly to standard graphics file formats. svviz is open source and freely available from github, and requires as input only structural variant coordinates (called using any other software package), reads in bam format, and a reference genome. Reads from any high-throughput sequencing platform are supported, including Illumina short-read, mate-pair, synthetic long-read (assembled), Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore. svviz is open source and freely available from https://github.com/svviz/svviz."
10.1101/016204,"The importance of the context of interactions in the proteins mutated in cancer is long known. However, our knowledge on how mutations affecting to protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are related to cancer occurrence and progression is still poor. Here, we extracted the missense somatic mutations from 5920 cancer patients of 33 different cancer types, taken from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and mapped them onto a structurally resolved interactome, which integrates three-dimensional atomic-level models of domain-domain interactions with experimentally determined PPIs, involving a total of 7580 unique interacting domains that participate in 13160 interactions connecting 4996 proteins. We observed that somatic nonsynonymous mutations tend to concentrate in ordered regions of the affected proteins and, within these, they have a clear preference for the interacting interfaces. Also, we have identified more than 250 interacting interfaces candidate to drive cancer. Examples demonstrate how mutations in the interacting interfaces are strongly associated with patient survival time, while similar mutations in other areas of the same proteins lack this association. Our results suggest that the perturbation caused by cancer mutations in protein interactions is an important factor in explaining the heterogeneity between cancer patients."
10.1101/016154,"Statistical factor analysis methods have previously been used to remove noise components from high dimensional data prior to genetic association mapping, and in a guided fashion to summarise biologically relevant sources of variation. Here we show how the derived factors summarising pathway expression can be used to analyse the relationships between expression, heritability and ageing. We used skin gene expression data from 647 twins from the MuTHER Consortium and applied factor analysis to concisely summarise patterns of gene expression, both to remove broad confounding influences and to produce concise pathway-level phenotypes. We derived 930 \""pathway phe-notypes\"" which summarised patterns of variation across 186 KEGG pathways (five phenotypes per pathway). We identified 69 significant associations of age with phenotype from 57 distinct KEGG pathways at a stringent Bon-ferroni threshold (P < 5.38 x 10-5). These phenotypes are more heritable (h2 = 0.32) than gene expression levels. On average, expression levels of 16% of genes within these pathways are associated with age. Several significant pathways relate to metabolising sugars and fatty acids, others with insulin signalling. We have demonstrated that factor analysis methods combined with biological knowledge can produce more reliable phenotypes with less stochastic noise than the individual gene expression levels, which increases our power to discover biologically relevant associations. These phenotypes could also be applied to discover associations with other environmental factors."

L. solanacearum\"", and the newly erected genus Liberibacter species, L. crescens (Lcr), have had their genomes sequenced. In all four cases there are three homogeneous copies of the 16S rRNA gene, one present as the reverse complement of the other two. 16S intragenic homogeneity is common within the -Proteobacteria. The presence of three 16S rRNA copies indicates an advantage for a rapid response of population increase to favourable growth conditions. The metabolic cost of carrying multiple copies is avoided during periods of low cellular activity as this situation occurs at low temperatures, for example overwintering in deciduous plants or in a dormant insect host.\n\nA large insertion in the 16S rDNA sequence of three species compared to the other three species indicates a dichotomy in the Liberibacter genus and provides a phylogenetic signal of closeness to the proximal node within the Rhizobiaceae. In spite of similar symptoms in Citrus crops associated with Lam and Las infections, these species belong on either side of this dichotomy, thus confirming Lam as phylogenetically closer to the proximal node than Las."
10.1101/016212,"Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been suggested to constitute a highly flexible mechanism for cortical information gating and processing, giving rise to conscious perception and various higher cognitive functions in humans. In particular, it might provide an elegant tool for information integration across several spatiotemporal scales within nested or coupled neuronal networks. However, it is currently unknown whether low frequency (theta/alpha) or high frequency gamma oscillations orchestrate cross-frequency interactions, raising the question of who is master and who is slave. While correlative evidence suggested that at least two distinct CFC modes exist, namely phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC) and amplitude-envelope-correlations (AEC), it is currently unknown whether they subserve distinct cortical functions. Novel non-invasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), now provide the unique opportunity to selectively entrain the low or high frequency component and study subsequent effects on CFC. Here, we demonstrate the differential modulation of CFC during selective entrainment of alpha or gamma oscillations. Our results reveal that entrainment of the low frequency component increased PAC, where gamma power became preferentially locked to the trough of the alpha oscillation, while gamma-band entrainment reduced alpha power through enhanced AECs. These results provide causal evidence for the functional role of coupled alpha and gamma oscillations for visual processing."

A unified structure/function model is proposed based on the common structural determinants shared by H/ACA and H/ACA-like motifs in both Euryarchaea and Crenarchaea. Using a computational approach, structural and energetic rules for the guide-target RNA-RNA interactions are derived from structural and functional data on the H/ACA RNP particles. H/ACA(-like) motifs found in Pyrococcus are evaluated through the classification and their biological relevance is discussed. Extra-ribosomal targets found in both Pyrococcus and Pyrobaculum are presented as testable gene candidates which might support the hypothesis of a gene regulation mediated by H/ACA(-like) guide RNAs."
10.1101/016303,"The forebrain has the most complex shape and structure of the vertebrate brain regions and the mechanisms of its formation remain obscure. Convergence and extension movements are characteristic of the posterior (spinal cord and hindbrain) neural plate (pNP) while tissue deformations and underlying cellular dynamics during the early shaping of the forebrain neural plate (fNP) are undefined. Here, we apply live imaging, automated cell tracking and computational analysis to quantitatively map cell behaviour in the zebrafish fNP. We demonstrate a novel mechanism in which planar cell rearrangements, with a passive signature, are orthogonal to those in the pNP, and cell divisions lacking planar-polarity facilitate thickening from two to three layers. We develop a mechanical model of the fNP in which polarised cell behaviour arises from interactions with dissimilar bordering tissues rather than from intrinsically polarised cells. The model unifies in vivo observations and provides a mechanistic understanding of fNP morphogenesis."
10.1101/016311,"Techniques for reconstructing geographical history along a phylogeny can answer many interesting question about the geographical origins of species. Bayesian models based on the assumption that taxa move through a diffusion process have found many applications. However, these methods rely on diffusion processes on a plane, and do not take the spherical nature of our planet in account. This makes it hard to perform analysis that cover the whole world, or do not take in account the distortions caused by projections like the Mercator projection.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a Bayesian phylogeographical method based on diffusion on a sphere. When the area where taxa are sampled from is small, a sphere can be approximated by a plane and the model results in the same inferences as with models using diffusion on a plane. For taxa samples from the whole world, we obtain substantial differences. We present an efficient algorithm for performing inference in an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and show applications to small and large samples areas.\n\nAvailability: The method is implemented in the GEO_SPHERE package in BEAST 2, which is open source licensed under LGPL."
10.1101/016261,"Premise of the StudyAutomatic self-fertilization may influence the geography of speciation, promote reproductive isolation between incipient species, and lead to ecological differentiation. As such, selfing taxa are predicted to co-occur more often with their closest relatives than are outcrossing taxa. Despite suggestions that this pattern may be general, the extent to which mating system influences range overlap in close relatives has not been tested formally across a diverse group of plant species pairs.\n\nMethodsWe test for a difference in range overlap between species pairs where zero, one, or both species are selfers, using data from 98 sister species pairs in 20 genera across 15 flowering plant families. We also use divergence time estimates from time-calibrated phylogenies to ask how range overlap changes with divergence time and whether this effect depends on mating system.\n\nKey ResultsWe find no evidence that automatic self-fertilization influences range overlap of closely related plant species. Sister pairs with more recent divergence times had modestly greater range overlap, but this effect did not depend on mating system.\n\nConclusionsThe absence of a strong influence of mating system on range overlap suggests that mating system plays a minor or inconsistent role compared to many other mechanisms potentially influencing the co-occurrence of close relatives."
10.1101/016345,"BackgroundInsertion sequences (IS) are small transposable elements, commonly found in bacterial genomes. Identifying the location of IS in bacterial genomes can be useful for a variety of purposes including epidemiological tracking and predicting antibiotic resistance. However IS are commonly present in multiple copies in a single genome, which complicates genome assembly and the identification of IS insertion sites. Here we present ISMapper, a mapping-based tool for identification of the site and orientation of IS insertions in bacterial genomes, direct from paired-end short read data.\n\nResultsISMapper was validated using three types of short read data: (i) simulated reads from a variety of species, (ii) Illumina reads from 5 isolates for which finished genome sequences were available for comparison, and (iii) Illumina reads from 7 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates for which predicted IS locations were tested using PCR. A total of 20 genomes, including 13 species and 32 distinct IS, were used for validation. ISMapper correctly identified 96% of known IS insertions in the analysis of simulated reads, and 98% in real Illumina reads. Subsampling of real Illumina reads to lower depths indicated ISMapper was reliable for average genome-wide read depths >20x. All ISAba1 insertions identified by ISMapper in the A. baumannii genomes were confirmed by PCR. In each A. baumannii genome, ISMapper successfully identified an IS insertion upstream of the ampC beta-lactamase that could explain phenotypic resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. The utility of ISMapper was further demonstrated by profiling genome-wide IS6110 insertions in 138 publicly available Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, revealing lineage-speific inserction and multi inserction hotspot.\n\nConclusionsISMapper provides a rapid and robust method for identifying IS insertion sites direct from short read data, with a high degree of accuracy demonstrated across a wide range of bacteria."

10.1101/016378,"The \""Coexistence Approach\"" is a mutual climate range (MCR) technique combined with the nearest-living relative (NLR) concept. It has been widely used for palaeoclimate reconstructions based on Eurasian plant fossil assemblages, most of them palynofloras (studied using light microscopy). The results have been surprisingly uniform, typically converging to subtropical, per-humid or monsoonal conditions. Studies based on the coexistence approach have had a marked impact in literature, generating over 10,000 citations thus far. However, recent studies have pointed out inherent theoretical and practical problems entangled in the application of this widely used method. But so far little is known how results generated by the coexistence approach are affected by subjective errors, data errors, and violations of the basic assumptions. The majority of Coexistence Approach studies make use of the Palaeoflora database (the combination of which will be abbreviated to CA+PF). Testing results produced by CA+PF studies has been hindered by the general unavailability of the contents in the underlying Palaeoflora database; two exceptions are the mean-annual temperature tolerances and lists of assigned associations between fossils and nearest-living relatives. Using a recently published study on the Eocene of China, which provides the first usable insight into the data structure of the Palaeoflora database, we compare the theory and practice of Coexistence Approach using the Palaeoflora database (CA+PF). We show that CA+PF is riddled by association and climate data error. We reveal the flaws in the application of CA, which is often in stark contrast to the theory of the method. We show that CA+PF is highly vulnerable against numerous sources of errors, mainly because it lacks safeguards that could identify unreliable data. We demonstrate that the CA+PF produces coherent, pseudo-precise results even for artificially generated, random plant assemblages. Alternative MCR-NLR methods can surpass the most imminent deficits of CA, and may be used as a stop-gap until more accurate bioclimatic and distribution data on potential Eurasian NLRs, and theoretically- and statistically-robust methods will become available. Finally, general guidelines are provided for the future application of methods using the mutual climatic range with nearest living relatives approach when reconstructing climate from plant fossil assemblages."

We examine the feed-forward loop dynamics quantitatively at the whole time interval of cell cycle. We rigorously proof the uniqueness of solutions to the models and obtain the exact solutions in one of them analytically.\n\nConclusionsWe have shown that different mechanisms of miRNA action lead to a variety of types of dynamical behavior of feed-forward loops. In particular, we find that the ability of feed-forward loop to dampen fluctuations introduced by transcription factor is the model and parameter dependent feature. We also discuss how our results could help a biologist to infer the mechanism of miRNA action"
10.1101/016295,"The understanding of the regulatory processes that orchestrate stem cell maintenance is a cornerstone in developmental biology. Here, we present a mathematical model based on a branching process formalism that predicts average rates of proliferative and differentiative divisions in a given stem cell population. In the context of vertebrate spinal neurogenesis, the model predicts complex non-monotonic variations in the rates of pp, pd and dd modes of division as well as in cell cycle length, in agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the model shows that the differentiation probability follows a binomial distribution, allowing us to develop equations to predict the rates of each mode of division. A phenomenological simulation of the developing spinal cord informed with the average cell cycle length and division rates predicted by the mathematical model reproduces the correct dynamics of proliferation and differentiation in terms of average numbers of progenitors and differentiated cells. Overall, the present mathematical framework represents a powerful tool to unveil the changes in the rate and mode of division of a given stem cell pool by simply quantifying numbers of cells at different times."
10.1101/016402,"P-bodies (PB) are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that aggregate into cytoplasmic foci when cells are exposed to stress. While the conserved mRNA decay and translational repression machineries are known components of PB, how and why cells assemble RNP complexes into large foci remain unclear. Using mass spectrometry to analyze proteins immunoisolated with the core PB protein Dhh1, we show that a considerable number of proteins contain low-complexity (LC) sequences, similar to proteins highly represented in mammalian RNP granules. We also show that the Hsp40 chaperone Ydj1, which contains an LC domain and controls prion protein aggregation, is required for the formation of Dhh1-GFP foci upon glucose depletion. New classes of proteins that reproducibly co-enrich with Dhh1-GFP during PB induction include proteins involved in nucleotide or amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, tRNA aminoacylation, and protein folding. Many of these proteins have been shown to form foci in response to other stresses. Finally, analysis of RNA associated with Dhh1-GFP shows enrichment of mRNA encoding the PB protein Pat1 and catalytic RNAs along with their associated mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins, suggesting an active role for RNA in PB function. Thus, global characterization of PB composition has uncovered proteins and RNA that are important for PB assembly."
10.1101/016329,"Hippocampal synaptic activity is probabilistic and because synaptic plasticity depends on its history, the amount of information that can be stored at a synapse is limited. The strong correlation between the size and efficacy of a synapse allowed us to estimate the precision of synaptic plasticity. In an electron microscopic reconstruction of hippocampal neuropil we found single axons making two or more synaptic contacts onto the same dendrites which would have shared histories of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. The postsynaptic spine heads, but not the spine necks, of these pairs were nearly identical in size. The precision is much greater than previous estimates and requires postsynaptic averaging over a time window many seconds to minutes in duration depending on the rate of input spikes and probability of release.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySpine heads on the same dendrite that receive input from the same axon are the same size."

We review here several emerging techniques of this class, their fields of applications, their advantages and limitations, and their validations. We argue that they will strongly impact on our understanding of developmental biology in the near future."
10.1101/016360,"Incomplete lineage sorting can cause incongruencies of the overall species-level phylogenetic tree with the phylogenetic trees for individual genes or genomic segments. If these incongruencies are not accounted for, it is possible to incur several biases in species tree estimation. Here, we present a simple maximum likelihood approach that accounts for ancestral variation and incomplete lineage sorting. We use a POlymorphisms-aware phylogenetic MOdel (PoMo) that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between-species variation data. We extend this model to perform efficient estimation of species trees. We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of incomplete lineage sorting using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed. In contrast to other approaches, our model does not use coalescent theory but is allele-frequency based. We show that PoMo is well suited for genome-wide species tree estimation and that on such data it is more accurate than previous approaches."
10.1101/016410,"\""Candidatus Liberibacter africanus\"" (Laf) has long been recognised as a causal agent of the devastating citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening. This species is currently restricted to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean islands and vectored by the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae. Blotchy mottle on citrus leaves is characteristic of the disease.\n\nSomewhat similar symptoms in the Rutaceous tree Calodendrum capensis (Cape Chestnut) resulted in the discovery of Laf outside commercial citrus crops in South Africa. This was classed as a subspecies of Laf (capensis, hence LafC). In subsequent surveys of both commercial citrus crops and Calodendrum, both natural and ornamental specimens, LafC was not found in the citrus crop, nor has Laf been found in C. capensis. HLB was reported from Madagascar in 1968 but no sequences from this source have so far been published.\n\nUntil fairly recently, only the reference 16S rRNA gene sequences of Laf (L22533) and LafC (AF137368) had been deposited in GenBank. Both of these reference sequences contain a number of unresolved nucleotides. Resolving these nucleotide positions by aligning against more recently available sequences, it becomes evident that these unresolved positions represent one percentage point difference in similarity between Laf and LafC. The originally reported 97.4% similarity is therefore incorrect based on this new information. Recalculating the similarity on the full length 16S rDNA sequence results in 99.54% similarity, a value too high to justify a subspecies status. LafC should therefore be reduced to that of a haplotype of Laf.\n\nFurther, the six 16S rRNA gene sequences currently available in GenBank identified as the species Laf separate into 2 haplotype groups. The 3 haplotypes of Laf are therefore LafA designated as the first accession sequenced (L22533), LafC for the former capensis subspecies and to recognise the prior use of this term, and LafB for the third haplotype not previously recognised. Thus the cryptic presence of 3 haplotypes is revealed by this review of the Laf 16S rDNA sequences."
10.1101/016519,"MotivationOwing to the complexity of the assembly problem, we do not yet have complete genome sequences. The difficulty in assembling reads into finished genomes is exacerbated by sequence repeats and the inability of short reads to capture sufficient genomic information to resolve those problematic regions. Established and emerging long read technologies show great promise in this regard, but their current associated higher error rates typically require computational base correction and/or additional bioinformatics preprocessing before they could be of value. We present LINKS, the Long Interval Nucleotide K-mer Scaffolder algorithm, a solution that makes use of the information in error-rich long reads, without the need for read alignment or base correction. We show how the contiguity of an ABySS E. coli K-12 genome assembly could be increased over five-fold by the use of beta-released Oxford Nanopore Ltd. (ONT) long reads and how LINKS leverages long-range information in S. cerevisiae W303 ONT reads to yield an assembly with less than half the errors of competing applications. Re-scaffolding the colossal white spruce assembly draft (PG29, 20 Gbp) and how LINKS scales to larger genomes is also presented. We expect LINKS to have broad utility in harnessing the potential of long reads in connecting high-quality sequences of small and large genome assembly drafts.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinformatics/software/links\n\nContactrwarren@bcgsc.ca"
10.1101/016451,"The advent of a new generation of electron microscopes and direct electron detectors has realized the potential of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a technique to generate high-resolution structures. However, calculating these structures requires high performance computing clusters, a resource that may be limiting to many likely cryo-EM users. To address this limitation and facilitate the spread of cryo-EM, we developed a publicly available  off-the-shelf computing environment on Amazons elastic cloud computing infrastructure. This environment provides users with single particle cryo-EM software packages and the ability to create computing clusters that can range in size from 16 to 480+ CPUs. Importantly, these computing clusters are also cost-effective, as we illustrate here by determining a near-atomic resolution structure of the 80S yeast ribosome for $28.89 USD in ~10 hours."
10.1101/016485,"O_LIThere is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time, and that this variation needs be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyze the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. Since this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it.\nC_LIO_LIWe present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modeling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied.\nC_LIO_LIWe present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analyzing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutationbased approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures.\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.\nC_LI"
10.1101/016386,"The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased speciation rates and/or decreased their extinction rates. It is still unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of BiSSE methods. Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden-State Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed state in the model are \""hidden\"" states that exhibit potentially distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model can be used as character-independent diversification (CID) models that allow for a complex diversification process that is independent of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate differences between observed and hidden states and detect when diversification rate differences do not correlate with the observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and the important ways in which HiSSE provides a more nuanced understanding of trait-dependent diversification."
10.1101/016337,"Recent genomic studies have highlighted the important role of admixture in shaping genome-wide patterns of diversity. Past admixture leaves a population genomic signature of linkage disequilibrium (LD), reflecting the mixing of parental chromosomes by segregation and recombination. The extent of this LD can be used to infer the timing of admixture. However, the results of inference can depend strongly on the assumed demographic model. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for modeling patterns of LD in a geographic contact zone where two differentiated populations are diffusing back together. We derive expressions for the expected LD and admixture tract lengths across geographic space as a function of the age of the contact zone and the dispersal distance of individuals. We develop an approach to infer age of contact zones using population genomic data from multiple spatially sampled populations by fitting our model to the decay of LD with recombination distance. We use our approach to explore the fit of a geographic contact zone model to three human population genomic datasets from populations along the Indonesian archipelago, populations in Central Asia and populations in India."
10.1101/016428,"As the number of whole genomes available for study increases, so also does the opportunity to find unsuspected features hidden within our genetic code. One such feature allows for an estimate of the Human Mutation Rate in human chromosomes to be made. A NUMT is a small fragment of the mitochondrial DNA that enters the nucleus of a cell, gets captured by a chromosome and thereafter passed on from generation to generation. Over the millions of years of evolution, this unexpected phenomenon has happened many times. But it is usually very difficult to be able to say just when a NUMT might have been created. However, this paper presents evidence to show that for one particular NUMT the date of formation was around 29 million ago, which places the event in the Early Oligocene; when our ancestors were small monkey-like creatures. So now all of us carry this NUMT in each of our cells as do Old World Monkeys, the Great Apes and our nearest relations, the Chimpanzees. The estimate of the Human Mutation obtained by the method outlined here gives a value which is higher than has been generally found; but this new value perhaps only applies to non-coding regions of the Human genome where there is little, if any, selection pressure against new mutations."
10.1101/016477,"The arrival of farming in Europe around 8,500 years ago necessitated adaptation to new environments, pathogens, diets, and social organizations. While indirect evidence of adaptation can be detected in patterns of genetic variation in present-day people, ancient DNA makes it possible to witness selection directly by analyzing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report the first genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest genome-wide dataset yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians dating to between 6500 and 1000 BCE, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include the first genome-wide data from the Anatolian Neolithic culture, who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europes first farmers, and whose genetic material we extracted by focusing on the DNA-rich petrous bone. We identify genome-wide significant signatures of selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height."
10.1101/016543,"Sex-biased demography, in which parameters governing migration and population size differ between females and males, has been studied through comparisons of X chromosomes, which are inherited sex-specifically, and autosomes, which are not. A common form of sex bias in humans is sex-biased admixture, in which at least one of the source populations differs in its proportions of females and males contributing to an admixed population. Studies of sex-biased admixture often examine the mean ancestry for markers on the X chromosome in relation to the autosomes. A simple framework noting that in a population with equally many females and males, [Formula] of X chromosomes appear in females, suggests that the mean X-chromosomal admixture fraction is a linear combination of female and male admixture parameters, with coefficients [Formula] and [Formula], respectively. Extending a mechanistic admixture model to accommodate the X chromosome, we demonstrate that this prediction is not generally true in admixture models, though it holds in the limit for an admixture process occurring as a single event. For a model with constant ongoing admixture, we determine the mean X-chromosomal admixture, comparing admixture on female and male X chromosomes to corresponding autosomal values. Surprisingly, in reanalyzing African-American genetic data to estimate sex-specific contributions from African and European sources, we find that the range of contributions compatible with the excess African ancestry on the X chromosome compared to autosomes has a wide spread, permitting scenarios either without male-biased contributions from Europe or without female-biased contributions from Africa."
10.1101/016527,"Heritability analyses of GWAS cohorts have yielded important insights into complex disease architecture, and increasing sample sizes hold the promise of further discoveries. Here, we analyze the genetic architecture of schizophrenia in 49,806 samples from the PGC, and nine complex diseases in 54,734 samples from the GERA cohort. For schizophrenia, we infer an overwhelmingly polygenic disease architecture in which [&ge;]71% of 1Mb genomic regions harbor at least one variant influencing schizophrenia risk. We also observe significant enrichment of heritability in GC-rich regions and in higher-frequency SNPs for both schizophrenia and GERA diseases. In bivariate analyses, we observe significant genetic correlations (ranging from 0.18 to 0.85) among several pairs of GERA diseases; genetic correlations were on average 1.3x stronger than correlations of overall disease liabilities. To accomplish these analyses, we developed a fast algorithm for multi-component, multi-trait variance components analysis that overcomes prior computational barriers that made such analyses intractable at this scale."
10.1101/016469,"The inference of demographic history from genome data is hindered by a lack of efficient computational approaches. In particular, it has proven difficult to exploit the information contained in the distribution of genealogies across the genome. We have previously shown that the generating function (GF) of genealogies can be used to analytically compute likelihoods of demographic models from configurations of mutations in short sequence blocks (Lohse et al., 2011). Although the GF has a simple, recursive form, the size of such likelihood computations explodes quickly with the number of individuals and applications of this framework have so far been limited to small samples (pairs and triplets) for which the GF can be written down by hand. Here we investigate several strategies for exploiting the inherent symmetries of the coalescent. In particular, we show that the GF of genealogies can be decomposed into a set of equivalence classes which allows likelihood calculations from non-trivial samples. Using this strategy, we used Mathematica to automate block-wise likelihood calculations based on the GF for a very general set of demographic scenarios that may involve population size changes, continuous migration, discrete divergence and admixture between multiple populations. To give a concrete example, we calculate the likelihood for a model of isolation with migration (IM), assuming two diploid samples without phase and outgroup information, and compare the power of our approach to that of minimal pairwise samples. We demonstrate the new inference scheme with an analysis of two individual butterfly genomes from the sister species Heliconius melpomene rosina and Heliconius cyndo."
10.1101/016436,"Real-world time-continuous stimuli such as video promise greater naturalism for studies of brain function. However, modeling the stimulus variation is challenging and introduces a bias in favor of particular descriptive dimensions. Alternatively, we can look for brain regions whose signal is correlated between subjects, essentially using one subject to model another. Intersubject correlation mapping (ICM) allows us to find brain regions driven in a canonical manner across subjects by a complex natural stimulus. However, it requires a direct voxel-to-voxel match between the spatiotemporal activity patterns and is thus only sensitive to common activations sufficiently extended to match up in Talairach space (or in an alternative, e.g. cortical-surface-based, common brain space). Here we introduce the more general approach of intersubject information mapping (IIM). For each brain region, IIM determines how much information is shared between the subjects' local spatiotemporal activity patterns. We estimate the intersubject mutual information using canonical correlation analysis applied to voxels within a spherical searchlight centered on each voxel in turn. The intersubject information estimate is invariant to linear transforms including spatial rearrangement of the voxels within the searchlight. This invariance to local encoding will be crucial in exploring fine-grained brain representations, which cannot be matched up in a common space and, more fundamentally, might be unique to each individual - like fingerprints. IIM yields a continuous brain map, which reflects intersubject information in fine-grained patterns. Performed on data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of subjects viewing the same television show, IIM and ICM both highlighted sensory representations, including primary visual and auditory cortices. However, IIM revealed additional regions in higher association cortices, namely temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex. These regions appear to encode the same information across subjects in their fine-grained patterns, although their spatial-average activation was not significantly correlated between subjects."

10.1101/012518,"Cell adaptability to environmental changes is conferred by complex transcriptional regulatory networks, which respond to external stimuli by modulating the expression dynamics of each gene. Hence, deciphering the network of transcriptional regulation is remarkably important, but proves to be extremely challenging, mainly due to the unfavorable ratio between the number of available observations and the number of parameters to estimate. Most of the existing computational methods for the inference of transcriptional networks consider steady-state gene expression datasets, and produce models of transcriptional regulation best explaining the observed static gene expression.\n\nGene expression time-courses are an emergent typology of gene expression data, paving the way to the characterization of the time-dependent dynamics of transcriptional regulation.\n\nIn this work we introduce the Complexity Invariant Dynamic Time Warping motif EnRichment (CIDER) analysis, a novel computational pipeline to identify the prominent waves of coordinated gene transcription induced in cells by external stimuli, and determine which TFs are involved in the coordination of gene transcription. The CIDER pipeline combines unsupervised time series clustering and motif enrichment analysis to first detect transcriptional expression patterns, and then identify the TFs over-represented in the promoter regions of gene sets with similar expression dynamics.\n\nThe ability of CIDER to correctly identify regulatory interactions is assessed on a realistic synthetic dataset of gene expression time-courses, generated by simulating the effects of knock-out perturbations on the E. coli regulatory network.\n\nThe CIDER source code and the validation datasets are available on request from the corresponding author."
10.1101/016576,"BackgroundEpistatic interactions among genomic loci are expected to explain a large fraction of the heritability of complex diseases and phenotypic traits of living organisms.\n\nAlthough epistasis detection methods are continually being developed, the current state of the art is exhaustive search methods, which become infeasible when the number of analyzed loci is large.\n\nResultsWe develop a novel latent interaction-based selection method for polymorphic loci as the first stage of a two-stage epistasis detection approach. Given a continuous phenotype and a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), we rank the SNPs according to their interaction potential. When tested on simulated datasets and compared to standard marginal association and exhaustive search methods, our procedure significantly outperforms main-effect heuristics, especially in the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD), which is explicitly accounted for in our model. Applied to real human genotype data, we prioritized several SNP pairs as candidates for epistatic interactions that influence human working memory performance, some of which are known to be connected to this phenotype.\n\nConclusionsThe proposed method improves two-stage epistasis detection. Its linear runtime and increased statistical power contribute to reducing the computational complexity and to addressing some of the statistical challenges associated with the genome-wide search for epistatic loci."
10.1101/016238,"Introgressive hybridization challenges the concepts we use to define species and infer phylogenetic relationships. Methods for inferring historical introgression from the genomes of extant species are now widely used, however, few guidelines have been articulated for how best to interpret results. Because these tests are inherently comparative, they are sensitive to the effects of missing data (unsampled species) and non-independence (hierarchical relationships among species). We demonstrate this using genomic RADseq data sampled from all extant species in the American live oaks (Quercus series Virentes), a group notorious for hybridization. By considering all species, and their phylogenetic relationships, we were able to distinguish true hybridizing lineages from those that falsely appear admixed. Six of seven species show evidence of admixture, often with multiple other species, but which is explained by hybrid introgression among few related lineages occurring in close proximity. We identify the Cuban oak as the most admixed lineage and test alternative scenarios for its origin. The live oaks form a continuous ring-like distribution around the Gulf of Mexico, connected in Cuba, across which they could effectively exchange alleles. However, introgression appears highly localized, suggesting that oak species boundaries, and their geographic ranges have remained relatively stable over evolutionary time."
10.1101/016626,"In many studies sex related genes have been found to evolve rapidly. We therefore expect plant pollen genes to evolve faster than sporophytic genes. In addition, pollen genes are expressed as haploids which can itself facilitate rapid evolution because recessive advantageous and deleterious alleles are not masked by dominant alleles. However, this mechanism is less straightforward to apply in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. For 1 million years A.thaliana has been self-compatible, a life history switch that has caused: a reduction in pollen competition, increased homozygosity and a dilution of masking in diploid expressed, sporophytic genes. In this study we have investigated the relative strength of selection on pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes in A. thaliana. We present two major findings: 1) before becoming self-compatible positive selection was stronger on pollen genes than sporophytic genes for A. thaliana; 2) current polymorphism data indicate selection is weaker on pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes. These results indicate that since A. thaliana has become self-compatible, selection on pollen genes has become more relaxed. This has led to higher polymorphism levels and a higher build-up of deleterious mutations in pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes."
10.1101/016618,"Genetic prediction based on either identity by state (IBS) sharing or pedigree information has been investigated extensively using Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methods. Such methods were pioneered in the plant and animal breeding literature and have since been applied to predict human traits with the aim of eventual clinical utility. However, methods to combine IBS sharing and pedigree information for genetic prediction in humans have not been explored. We introduce a two variance component model for genetic prediction: one component for IBS sharing and one for approximate pedigree structure, both estimated using genetic markers. In simulations using real genotypes from CARe and FHS family cohorts, we demonstrate that the two variance component model achieves gains in prediction r2 over standard BLUP at current sample sizes, and we project based on simulations that these gains will continue to hold at larger sample sizes. Accordingly, in analyses of four quantitative phenotypes from CARe and two quantitative phenotypes from FHS, the two variance component model significantly improves prediction r2 in each case, with up to a 20% relative improvement. We also find that standard mixed model association tests can produce inflated test statistics in data sets with related individuals, whereas the two variance component model corrects for inflation.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic prediction has been well-studied in plant and animal breeding and has generated considerable recent interest in human genetics, both in family data sets and in population cohorts. Many prediction studies are based on the widely used Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) approach, which performs a mixed model analysis using a genetic relationship matrix that is either estimated from genotype data--thus measuring identity-by-state (IBS) sharing--or obtained from family pedigree information. We show here that a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy in family data sets can be obtained by jointly modeling both IBS sharing and approximate pedigree structure, both estimated using genetic markers, using separate variance components within a two variance component mixed model. We demonstrate the performance of this model in simulations and real data sets. We also show that previous mixed model association methods suffer from inflated test statistics in family data sets due to their failure to account for the different heritability parameters corresponding to IBS sharing vs. pedigree relatedness. Our two variance component model provides a solution to this problem without compromising statistical power."

10.1101/016592,"Mutations virtually always have pleiotropic effects, yet most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analyze effects one trait at a time. In order to investigate the performance of a multivariate approach to GWAS, we simulated scenarios where variation in a d-dimensional phenotype space was caused by a known subset of SNPs. Multivariate analyses of variance were then carried out on k traits, where k could be less than, greater than or equal to d. Our results show that power is maximized and false discovery rate (FDR) minimized when the number of traits analyzed, k, matches the true dimensionality of the phenotype being analyzed, d. When true dimensionality is high, the power of a single univariate analysis can be an order of magnitude less than the k=d case, even when the single trait with the largest genetic variance is chosen for analysis. When traits are added to a study in order of their independent genetic variation, the gains in power from increasing k up to d are much larger than the loss in power when k exceeds d. Simulations that explicitly model linkage disequilibrium (LD) indicate that when SNPs in disequilibrium are subjected to multivariate analysis, the magnitude of the apparent effect induced onto null SNPs by SNPs carrying a true effect weakens as k approaches d, such that the rank of P-values among a set of correlated SNPs becomes an increasingly reliable predictor of true positives. Multivariate GWAS outperform univariate ones under a wide range of conditions, and should become the standard in studies of the inheritance of complex phenotypes."
10.1101/016683,"BackgroundBayesian networks are directed acyclic graphical models widely used to represent the probabilistic relationships between random variables. They have been applied in various biological contexts, including gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interactions inference. Generally, learning Bayesian networks from experimental data is NP-hard, leading to widespread use of heuristic search methods giving suboptimal results. However, in cases when the acyclicity of the graph can be externally ensured, it is possible to find the optimal network in polynomial time. While our previously developed tool BNFinder implements polynomial time algorithm, reconstructing networks with the large amount of experimental data still leads to computations on single CPU growing exceedingly.\n\nResultsIn the present paper we propose parallelized algorithm designed for multi-core and distributed systems and its implementation in the improved version of BNFinder - tool for learning optimal Bayesian networks. The new algorithm has been tested on different simulated and experimental datasets showing that it has much better efficiency of parallelization than the previous version. BNFinder gives comparable results in terms of accuracy with respect to current state-of-the-art inference methods, giving significant advantage in cases when external information such as regulators list or prior edge probability can be introduced.\n\nConclusionsWe show that the new method can be used to reconstruct networks in the size range of thousands of genes making it practically applicable to whole genome datasets of prokaryotic systems and large components of eukaryotic genomes.

10.1101/016709,"Natural environments are never truly constant, but the evolutionary implications of temporally varying selection pressures remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how the fate of a new mutation in a fluctuating environment depends on the dynamics of environmental variation and on the selective pressures in each condition. We find that even when a mutation experiences many environmental epochs before fixing or going extinct, its fate is not necessarily determined by its time-averaged selective effect. Instead, environmental variability reduces the efficiency of selection across a broad parameter regime, rendering selection unable to distinguish between mutations that are substantially beneficial and substantially deleterious on average. Temporal fluctuations can also dramatically increase fixation probabilities, often making the details of these fluctuations more important than the average selection pressures acting on each new mutation. For example, mutations that result in a tradeoff between conditions but are strongly deleterious on average can nevertheless be more likely to fix than mutations that are always neutral or beneficial. These effects can have important implications for patterns of molecular evolution in variable environments, and they suggest that it may often be difficult for populations to maintain specialist traits, even when their loss leads to a decline in time-averaged fitness."
10.1101/016675,"The evolution of heterogametic sex chromosome is often - but not always - accompanied by the evolution of dosage compensating mechanisms that mitigate the impact of sex-specific gene dosage on levels of gene expression. One emerging view of this process is that such mechanisms may only evolve in male-heterogametic (XY) species but not in female-heterogametic (ZW) species, which will consequently exhibit \""incomplete\"" sex chromosome dosage compensation. However, recent results suggest that at least some Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) may prove to be an exception to this prediction. Studies in bombycoid moths indicate the presence of a chromosome-wide epigenetic mechanism that effectively balances Z chromosome gene expression between the sexes by reducing Z-linked expression in males. In contrast, strong sex chromosome dosage effects without any reduction in male Z-linked expression were previously reported in a pyralid moth, suggesting a lack of any such dosage compensating mechanism. Here we report an analysis of sex chromosome dosage compensation in Heliconius butterflies, sampling multiple individuals for several different adult tissues (head, abdomen, leg, mouth, and antennae). Methodologically, we introduce a novel application of linear mixed-effects models to assess dosage compensation, offering a unified statistical framework that can estimate effects specific to chromosome, to sex, and their interactions (i.e., a dosage effect). Our results show substantially reduced Z-linked expression relative to autosomes in both sexes, as previously observed in bombycoid moths. This observation is consistent with an increasing body of evidence that some lepidopteran species possess an epigenetic dosage compensating mechanism that reduces Z chromosome expression in males to levels comparable with females. However, this mechanism appears to be imperfect in Heliconius, resulting in a modest dosage effect that produces an average 5-20% increase in male expression relative to females on the Z chromosome, depending on the tissue. Thus our results in Heliconius reflect a mixture of previous patterns reported for Lepidoptera. In Heliconius, a moderate pattern of \""incomplete\"" dosage compensation persists apparently despite the presence of an epigenetic dosage compensating mechanism. The chromosomal distributions of sex-biased genes show an excess of male-biased and a dearth of female-biased genes on the Z chromosome relative to autosomes, consistent with predictions of sexually antagonistic evolution."
10.1101/016725,"When learning a complex task our nervous system self-organizes large groups of neurons into coherent dynamic activity patterns. During this, a cell assembly network with multiple, simultaneously active, and computationally powerful assemblies is formed; a process which is so far not understood. Here we show that the com- bination of synaptic plasticity with the slower process of synaptic scaling achieves formation of such assembly networks. This type of self-organization allows executing a difficult, six degrees of freedom, manipulation task with a robot where assemblies need to learn computing complex non-linear transforms and - for execution - must cooperate with each other without interference. This mechanism, thus, permits for the first time the guided self-organization of computationally powerful sub-structures in dynamic networks for behavior control."

10.1101/016733,"Determining the interconverting conformations of dynamic proteins in atomic detail is a major challenge for structural biology. Conformational heterogeneity in the active site of the dynamic enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) has been previously linked to its catalytic function, but the extent to which the different conformations of these residues are correlated is unclear. Here we compare the conformational ensembles of CypA by multitemperature synchrotron crystallography and fixed-target X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) crystallography. The \""diffraction-before-destruction\"" nature of XFEL experiments provides a radiation-damage-free view of the functionally important alternative conformations of CypA, confirming earlier synchrotron-based results. We monitored the temperature dependences of these alternative conformations with eight synchrotron datasets spanning 100-310 K. Multiconformer models show that many alternative conformations in CypA are populated only at 240 K and above, yet others remain populated or become populated at 180 K and below. These results point to a complex evolution of conformational heterogeneity between 180-240 K that involves both thermal deactivation and solvent-driven arrest of protein motions in the crystal. The lack of a single shared conformational response to temperature within the dynamic active-site network provides evidence for a conformation shuffling model, in which exchange between rotamer states for a large aromatic ring in the middle of the network shifts the conformational ensemble for the other residues in the network. Together, our multitemperature analyses and XFEL data motivate a new generation of temperature- and time-resolved experiments to structurally characterize the dynamic underpinnings of protein function."
10.1101/016782,"Evolution is a dynamic process. The two classical forces of evolution are mutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution can be predicted based solely on the fitness differences between phenotypes. Predicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation rates as well as varying fitness is still an open question. Experimental procedures, however, do include these complexities along with fluctuating population sizes and stochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate the mutational path probabilities of systems having epistatic effects on both fitness and mutation rates using a theoretical and computational framework. In contrast to previous models, we do not limit ourselves to the typical strong selection, weak mutation (SSWM)-regime or to fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic interactions to also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively non-trivial dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can overcome fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential to extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation and bring us closer to what is observed in experimental systems."
10.1101/016774,"Sex determination evolves rapidly, often because of turnover of the genes at the top of the pathway. The house fly, Musca domestica, has a multifactorial sex determination system, allowing us to identify the selective forces responsible for the evolutionary turnover of sex determination in action. There is a male determining factor, M, on the Y chromosome (YM), which is probably the ancestral state. An M factor on the third chromosome (IIIM) has reached high frequencies in multiple populations across the world, but the evolutionary forces responsible for the invasion of IIIM are not resolved. To test if the IIIM chromosome invaded because of sex-specific selection pressures, we used mRNA sequencing to determine if isogenic males that differ only in the presence of the YM or IIIM chromosome have different gene expression profiles. We find that more genes are differentially expressed between YM and IIIM males in testis than head, and that genes with male-biased expression are most likely to be differentially expressed between YM and IIIM males. We additionally find that IIIM males have a \""masculinized\"" gene expression profile, suggesting that the IIIM chromosome has accumulated an excess of male-beneficial alleles because of its male-limited transmission. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sex-specific selection acts on alleles linked to the male-determining locus driving evolutionary turnover in the sex determination pathway."
10.1101/016758,"BackgroundNext Generation Sequencing and other high-throughput technologies have brought a revolution to the bioinformatics landscape, by offering sheer amounts of data about previously unaccessible domains in a cheap and scalable way. However, fast, reproducible, and cost-effective data analysis at such scale remains elusive. A key need for achieving it is being able to access and query the vast amount of publicly available data, specially so in the case of knowledge-intensive, semantically rich data: incredibly valuable information about proteins and their functions, genes, pathways, or all sort of biological knowledge encoded in ontologies remains scattered, semantically and physically fragmented.\n\nMethods and ResultsGuided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph models. We have modeled and integrated most publicly available data linked with proteins into a set of interdependent graphs. Data querying is possible through a data model aware Domain Specific Language implemented in Java, letting the user write typed graph traversals over the integrated data. A ready to use cloud-based data distribution, based on the Titan graph database engine is provided; generic data import code can also be used for in-house deployment.\n\nConclusionBio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for several key problems: data integration; expressive, high performance data access; and a cost-effective scalable cloud deployment model."
10.1101/016824,"Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimeters in diameter, composed of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is remarkable about cancers is their homogeneity - virtually every neoplastic cell within a large cancer contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that have emerged after the last clonal expansions. How such clones expand within the spatially-constrained three dimensional architecture of a tumor, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has never been explained. We here describe a model for tumor evolution that shows how short-range migration and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumor. With it, we show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large tumor allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model not only provides novel insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumor growth but also suggests that targeting short range cellular migratory activity could have dramatic effects on tumor growth rates."
10.1101/016790,"Epistatic interactions can frustrate and shape evolutionary change 1, 2 3-7. Indeed, phenotypes may fail to evolve because essential mutations can only be selected positively if fixed simultaneously 5,8,9. How environmental variability affects such constraints is poorly understood. Here we studied genetic constraints in fixed and fluctuating environments, using the Escherichia coli lac operon as a model system for genotype-environment interactions. The data indicated an apparent paradox: in different fixed environments, mutational trajectories became trapped at sub-optima where no further improvements were possible, while repeated switching between these same environments allowed unconstrained adaptation by continuous improvements. Pervasive cross-environmental trade-offs transformed peaks into valleys upon environmental change, thus enabling escape from entrapment. This study shows that environmental variability can lift genetic constraint, and that trade-offs not only impede but can also facilitate adaptive evolution."
10.1101/016808,"BackgroundNext-generation sequencing (NGS) offers unprecedented opportunities to expand clinical genomics. It also presents challenges with respect to integration with data from other sequencing methods and historical data. Provision of consistent, clinically applicable variant annotation of NGS data has proved difficult, particularly of indels, an important variant class in clinical genomics. Annotation in relation to a reference genome sequence, the DNA strand of coding transcripts and potential alternative variant representations has not been well addressed. Here we present tools that address these challenges to provide rapid, standardized, clinically appropriate annotation of NGS data in line with existing clinical standards.\n\nMethodsWe developed a clinical sequencing nomenclature (CSN), a fixed variant annotation consistent with the principles of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines, optimized for automated variant annotation of NGS data. To deliver high-throughput CSN annotation we created CAVA (Clinical Annotation of VAriants), a fast, lightweight tool designed for easy incorporation into NGS pipelines. CAVA allows transcript specification, appropriately accommodates the strand of a gene transcript and flags variants with alternative annotations to facilitate clinical interpretation and comparison with other datasets. We evaluated CAVA in exome data and a clinical BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing pipeline.\n\nResultsCAVA generated CSN calls for 10,313,034 variants in the ExAC database in 13.44 hours, and annotated the ICR1000 exome series in 6.5 hours. Evaluation of 731 different indels from a single individual revealed 92% had alternative representations in left aligned and right aligned data. Annotation of left aligned data, as performed by many annotation tools, would thus give clinically discrepant annotation for the 339 (46%) indels in genes transcribed from the forward DNA strand. By contrast, CAVA provides the correct clinical annotation for all indels. CAVA also flagged the 370 indels with alternative representations of a different functional class, which may profoundly influence clinical interpretation. CAVA annotation of 50 BRCA1/BRCA2 gene mutations from a clinical pipeline gave 100% concordance with Sanger data; only 8/25 BRCA2 mutations were correctly clinically annotated by other tools.\n\nConclusionsCAVA is a freely available tool that provides rapid, robust, high-throughput clinical annotation of NGS data, using a standardized Clinical Sequencing Nomenclature."
10.1101/016881,"In finite populations, an allele disappears or reaches fixation due to two main forces, selection and drift. Selection is generally thought to accelerate the process: a selected mutation will reach fixation faster than a neutral one, and a disadvantageous one will quickly disappear from the population. We show that even in simple diploid populations, this is often not true. Dominance and recessivity unexpectedly slow down the evolutionary process for weakly selected alleles. In particular, slightly advantageous dominant and mildly deleterious recessive mutations reach fixation more slowly than neutral ones. This phenomenon determines genetic signatures opposite to those expected under strong selection, such as increased instead of decreased genetic diversity around the selected site. Furthermore, we characterize a new phenomenon: mildly deleterious recessive alleles, thought to represent the vast majority of newly arising mutations, survive in a population longer than neutral ones, before getting lost. Hence, natural selection is less effective than previously thought in getting rid rapidly of slightly negative mutations, contributing their observed persistence in present populations. Consequently, low frequency slightly deleterious mutations are on average older than neutral ones.\n\nAuthor SummaryA common assumption among geneticists is that neutral alleles survive longer in a population than selected variants: negative selection would rapidly lead to the extinction of deleterious mutations, while advantageous alleles under positive selection will spread in the population till fixation. Here we show that unless an allele is perfectly codominant, these assumptions are often incorrect. Under weak selection, even in the simplest models, incomplete dominance and recessivity are sufficient to determine slower fixation and extinction times than for a neutral allele. These seemingly paradoxical results suggest that mildly deleterious mutations accumulate at the population level, and that nearly neutral mutations behave very differently from strongly selected ones. Furthermore, a fraction of selected regions would show opposite patterns for many standard statistics used to detect genomic signatures of positive selection, remaining virtually impossible to detect."
10.1101/016832,"Strong ecological selection on a genetic locus can maintain allele frequency differences between populations in different environments, even in the face of hybridization. When alleles at divergent loci come into tight linkage disequilibria, selection acts on them as a unit and can significantly reduce gene flow. For populations interbreeding across a hybrid zone, linkage disequilibria between loci can force clines to share the same slopes and centers. However, strong ecological selection can push clines away from the others, reducing linkage disequilibria and weakening the barrier to gene flow. We looked for this  cline uncoupling effect in a hybrid zone between stream resident and anadromous sticklebacks at two genes known to be under divergent natural selection (Eda and ATP1a1) and five morphological traits that repeatedly evolve in freshwater stickleback. We used 10 anonymous SNPs to characterize the shape of the zone. We found that the clines at Eda, ATP1a1, and four morphological traits were concordant and coincident, suggesting that direct selection on each is outweighed by the indirect selection generated by linkage disequilibria. Interestingly, the cline for pectoral fin length was much steeper and displaced 200m downstream, and two anonymous SNPs also had steep clines."
10.1101/016865,"MicroRNA (miRNA) sponges have been shown to function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate the expression of other miRNA targets in the network by sequestering available miRNAs. As the first systematic investigation of the genome-wide genetic effect on ceRNA regulation, we applied multivariate response regression and identified widespread genetic variations that are associated with ceRNA competition using 462 Geuvadis RNA-seq data in multiple human populations. We showed that SNPs in gene 3UTRs at the miRNA seed binding regions can simultaneously regulate gene expression changes in both cis and trans by the ceRNA mechanism. We termed these loci as endogenous miRNA sponge expression quantitative trait loci or \""emsQTLs\"", and found that a large number of them were unexplored in conventional eQTL mapping. We identified many emsQTLs are undergoing recent positive selection in different human populations. Using GWAS results, we found that emsQTLs are significantly enriched in traits/diseases associated loci. Functional prediction and prioritization extend our understanding on causality of emsQTL allele in disease pathways. We illustrated that emsQTL can synchronously regulate the expression of tumor suppressor and oncogene through ceRNA competition in angiogenesis. Together these results provide a distinct catalog and characterization of functional noncoding regulatory variants that control ceRNA crosstalk."
10.1101/016857,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular these days and one of the key questions is how much heritability could be explained by all variants in GWAS. We have previously proposed an approach to answer this question, based on recovering the \""true\"" z-statistics from a set of observed z-statistics. Only summary statistics are required. However, methods for standard error (SE) estimation are not available yet, thereby limiting the interpretation of the results. In this study we developed resampling-based approaches to estimate the SE and the methods are implemented in an R package. We found that delete-d-jackknife and parametric bootstrap approaches provide good estimates of the SE.

10.1101/016873,"Highlights* The advent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach provides a promising framework for dissecting the genetic basis of bacterial or archaeal phenotypes.\n\n* Bacterial genomes tend to be shaped by stronger positive selection, stronger linkage disequilibrium and stronger population stratification than humans, with implications for GWAS power and resolution.\n\n* An example GWAS in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes highlights the potentially confounding effects of linkage disequilibrium and population stratification.\n\n* A comparison of the traditional GWAS approach versus a somewhat orthogonal method based upon evolutionary convergence (phyC) shows strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.\n\nAbstractSignificant advances in sequencing technologies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed substantial insight into the genetic architecture of human phenotypes. In recent years, the application of this approach in bacteria has begun to reveal the genetic basis of bacterial host preference, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. Here, we consider relevant differences between bacterial and human genome dynamics, apply GWAS to a global sample of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes to highlight the impacts of linkage disequilibrium, population stratification, and natural selection, and finally compare the traditional GWAS against phyC, a contrasting method of mapping genotype to phenotype based upon evolutionary convergence. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of both methods, and make suggestions for factors to be considered in future bacterial GWAS.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/016873_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@431609org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5bad1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c1ff30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58e539_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"
10.1101/016923,"BackgroundHox gene collinearity relates the sequential location of Hox genes in the 3 to 5 direction on the chromosome with the linear arrangement of the body elements along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of bilaterian embryos. This spatial Hox gene collinearity has been almost universally respected in diverse organisms like worms, insects or vertebrates. It is therefore surprising that the above well established collinearity rule is violated in the case of Echinoderms. No explanation of this violation is apparent. Here a hypothesis is put forward which provides a cue to understand the abnormal serial gene location in the sea urchin disorganized Hox cluster.\n\nResultsBilateral symmetry along the A/P embryo axis is established at the very early stages of ontogeny of the sea urchin. For the subsequent developmental stages, rotational symmetry emerges in the vestibula larva. In analogy to the linear A/P case, the circular topology of modules might be a reflection of the architectural restructuring of the Hox loci where the 3 and 5 ends of the Hox cluster approach each other so that a closed contour of the chromatin fiber is formed. At a later stage, the break and opening of the cluster contour at the level of Hox4 combined with the rotational symmetry leads to the observed Hox gene sequence that violates the standard 3 to 5 collinearity.\n\nConclusionThe unusual gene series manifests the congruence of Hox gene sequence in the cluster with the circular arrangement of the sea urchin primary podia. Accordingly, the Hox sequence after the break at Hox4 is not a violation but an extension of Hox gene collinearity to animals with rotational symmetry."
10.1101/016915,"Organisms have different circuitries that allow converting signal molecule levels to changes in gene expression. An important challenge in synthetic biology involves the de novo design of RNA modules enabling dynamic signal processing in live cells. This requires a scalable methodology for sensing, transmission, and actuation, which could be assembled into larger signaling networks. Here, we present a biochemical strategy to design RNA-mediated signal transduction cascades able to sense small molecules and small RNAs. We design switchable functional RNA domains by using strand-displacement techniques. We experimentally characterize the molecular mechanism underlying our synthetic RNA signaling cascades, show the ability to regulate gene expression with transduced RNA signals, and describe the signal processing response of our systems to periodic forcing in single live cells. The engineered systems integrate RNA-RNA interaction with available ribozyme and aptamer elements, providing new ways to engineer arbitrary complex gene circuits."
10.1101/016840,"Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \""self-organizing\"" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms."
10.1101/016972,"Meiotic recombination rate varies across the genome within and between individuals, populations, and species in virtually all taxa studied. In almost every species, this variation takes the form of discrete recombination hotspots, determined in Metazoans by a protein called PRDM9. Hotspots and their determinants have a profound effect on the genomic landscape, and share certain features that extend across the tree of life. Drosophila, in contrast, are anomalous in their absence of hotspots, PRDM9, and other species-specific differences in the determination of recombination. To better understand the evolution of meiosis and general patterns of recombination across diverse taxa, we present what may be the most comprehensive portrait of recombination to date, combining contemporary recombination estimates from each of two sister species along with historic estimates of recombination using linkage-disequilibrium-based approaches derived from sequence data from both species. Using Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila miranda as a model system, we compare recombination rate between species at multiple scales, and we replicate the pattern seen in human-chimpanzee that recombination rate is conserved at broad scales and more divergent at finer scales. We also find evidence of a species-wide recombination modifier, resulting in both a present and historic genome wide elevation of recombination rates in D. miranda, and identify broad scale effects on recombination from the presence of an inter-species inversion. Finally, we reveal an unprecedented view of the distribution of recombination in D. pseudoobscura, illustrating patterns of linked selection and where recombination is taking place. Overall, by combining these estimation approaches, we highlight key similarities and differences in recombination between Drosophila and other organisms.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecombination, or crossing over, describes an essential exchange of genetic material that occurs during egg and sperm development and has consequences for the proper segregation of chromosomes, and for the evolution of genomes and genomic features. In our study, we compare genome wide recombination rate in two closely related species of the fruit fly Drosophila to understand if and how recombination changes over time. We find that recombination does indeed change, we observe globally increased recombination in one species, and differences in regional recombination likely reflecting the result of a chromosomal rearrangement in both species. Moreover, we show that the extent that recombination changes is dependent on the physical scale at which recombination is measured, likely reflecting selection pressures on recombination distribution and replicating a pattern seen in human-chimpanzee recombination. Apart from between-species differences, we note several ways in which the Drosophila recombination landscape has changed since Drosophila diverged from other organisms. In contrast to species of fungi, plants, and animals, Drosophila recombination is not concentrated in discrete regions known as hotspots, nor is it increased near the start of genes, suggesting that despite the importance of the recombination process, the determinants of recombination have been shifting over evolutionary time."
10.1101/016956,"Porcine carcass that is approximately 800 mm long may be expected to have one additional vertebra. Therefore, the number of vertebrae in pigs is an economically important trait. To examine the genetic basis of this trait, we genotyped 593 F2 Large White x Minzhu pigs using the Porcine SNP60K BeadChip. A genome-wide association study identified 39 significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the chromosomes SSC1 and SSC7. An 8.82-Mb region that contained all 21 significant SNPs on SSC1 harbored the gene NR6A1, previously reported to influence the number of vertebrae in pigs. The remaining 18 significant SNPs on SSC7 were concentrated in a 4.56-Mb region, which was within the quantitative trait loci interval for number of vertebrae. A haplotype sharing analysis refined the locus to a segment of [~]637 Kb. The most significant SNP, SIRI0001067, was contained in this refined region on SSC7 and located in one of the introns of TGFB3. As TGFB3 influences the development of vertebrae in mammalian embryos, the gene may be another strong candidate for the number of vertebrae in pigs."
10.1101/016949,"The human gut microbiota is impacted by host nutrition and health status and therefore represents a potentially adaptive phenotype influenced by metabolic and immune constraints. Previous studies contrasting rural populations in developing countries to urban industrialized ones have shown that industrialization is strongly correlated with patterns in human gut microbiota; however, we know little about the relative contribution of factors such as climate, diet, medicine, hygiene practices, host genetics, and parasitism. Here, we focus on fine-scale comparisons of African rural populations in order to (i) contrast the gut microbiota of populations inhabiting similar environments but having different traditional subsistence modes and either shared or distinct genetic ancestry, and (ii) examine the relationship between gut parasites and bacterial communities. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of Pygmy hunter-gatherers as well as Bantu individuals from both farming and fishing populations in Southwest Cameroon, we found that the gut parasite Entamoeba is significantly correlated with microbiome composition and diversity. We show that across populations, colonization by this protozoa can be predicted with 79% accuracy based on the composition of an individual's gut microbiota, and that several of the taxa most important for distinguishing Entamoeba absence or presence are signature taxa for autoimmune disorders. We also found gut communities to vary significantly with subsistence mode, notably with some taxa previously shown to be enriched in other hunter-gatherers groups (in Tanzania and Peru) also discriminating hunter-gatherers from neighboring farming or fishing populations in Cameroon.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in determining human health. Its been hypothesized that the industrialized lifestyle, marked by a diet rich in processed foods, higher use of antibiotics, increased hygiene, and exposure to various chemicals, has altered microbiota in ways that are harmful. Studies have addressed this by comparing rural and industrialized populations, and have found that they systematically vary in their gut microbiome composition. Nevertheless, the relative influence of host genetics, diet, climate, medication, hygiene practices, and parasitism is still not clear. In addition, microbial variation between nearby human populations has not been explored in depth. Moreover, The World Health Organization estimates that 24% of the worlds population, concentrated in developing countries, is infected with gut parasites. Despite this, and evidence for direct interactions between the immune system and both gut parasites and bacteria, we know relatively little about the relationship between gut helminths, protozoa, and bacteria. In our study, we aimed to address some of this complexity. To do so, we characterized the gut microbial communities and parasites from Pygmy hunter-gatherer and Bantu farming and fishing populations from seven locations in the rainforest of Southwest Cameroon. We found that both subsistence mode and the presence of the gut protozoa, Entamoeba, were significantly correlated with microbiome composition. These findings support previous studies demonstrating diet is an important determinant of gut microbiota, and further show that this pattern holds true at a local scale, in traditional societies inhabiting a similar environment. Additionally, we show a significant relationship between a common human parasite (Entamoeba) and gut bacterial community composition, suggesting potential important interactions between the immune system, gut bacteria, and gut parasites, highlighting the need for more hierarchical cross population studies that include parasitism as potential factor influencing gut microbiota dynamics."

10.1101/017020,"Twelve replicate populations of Escherichia coli have been evolving in the laboratory for more than 25 years and 60,000 generations. We analyzed bacteria from whole-population samples frozen every 500 generations through 20,000 generations for one well-studied population, called Ara-1. By tracking 42 known mutations in these samples, we reconstructed the history of this populations genotypic evolution over this period. The evolutionary dynamics of Ara-1 show strong evidence of selective sweeps as well as clonal interference between competing lineages bearing different beneficial mutations. In some cases, sets of several mutations approached fixation simultaneously, often conveying no information about their order of origination; we present several possible explanations for the existence of these mutational cohorts. Against a backdrop of rapid selective sweeps both earlier and later, we found that two clades coexisted for over 6000 generations before one drove the other extinct. In that time, at least nine mutations arose in the clade that prevailed. We found evidence that the clades evolved a frequency-dependent interaction, which prevented the competitive exclusion of either clade, but which eventually collapsed as beneficial mutations accumulated in the clade that prevailed. Clonal interference and frequency dependence can occur even in the simplest microbial populations. Furthermore, frequency dependence may generate dynamics that extend the period of coexistence that would otherwise be sustained by clonal interference alone."
10.1101/016980,"Common genetic variants buffered by Hsp90 are candidates for human diseases of signaling such as cancer. Like cancer, morphological abnormalities buffered by Hsp90 are discrete threshold traits with a continuous underlying basis of liability determining their probability of occurrence. QTL and deletion maps for one of the most frequent Hsp90-dependent abnormalities in Drosophila, deformed eye (dfe), were replicated across three genetically related artificial selection lines using strategies dependent on proximity to the dfe threshold and the direction of genetic and environmental effects. Up to 17 dfe loci (QTL) linked by 7 interactions were detected based on the ability of small recombinant regions of an unaffected and completely homozygous control genotype to dominantly suppress or enhance dfe penetrance at its threshold in groups of isogenic recombinant flies, and over 20 deletions increased dfe penetrance from a low expected value in one or more line, identifying a complex network of genes responsible for the dfe phenotype. Replicated comparisons of these whole-genome mapping approaches identified several QTL regions narrowly defined by deletions and 4 candidate genes, with additional uncorrelated QTL and deletions highlighting differences between the approaches and the need for caution in attributing the effect of deletions directly to QTL genes."
10.1101/016998,"A comparative transcriptomic study of mosquito olfactory tissues recently published in BMC Genomics (Hodges et al, 2014) reported several novel findings that have broad implications for the field of insect olfaction. In this brief commentary, we outline why the conclusions of Hodges et al. are problematic under the current models of insect olfaction and then contrast their findings with those of other RNAseq based studies of mosquito olfactory tissues. We also generated a new RNAseq data set from the maxillary palp of Anopheles gambiae in an effort to replicate the novel results of Hodges et al. but were unable to reproduce their results. Instead, our new RNAseq data support the more straightforward explanation that the novel findings of Hodges et al. were a consequence of contamination by antennal RNA. In summary, we find strong evidence to suggest that the conclusions of Hodges et al were spurious, and that at least some of their RNAseq data sets were irrevocably compromised by cross-contamination between samples."
10.1101/017087,"Enormous databases of short-read RNA-seq sequencing experiments such as the NIH Sequence Read Archive (SRA) are now available. However, these collections remain difficult to use due to the inability to search for a particular expressed sequence. A natural question is which of these experiments contain sequences that indicate the expression of a particular sequence such as a gene isoform, lncRNA, or uORF. However, at present this is a computationally demanding question at the scale of these databases.\n\nWe introduce an indexing scheme, the Sequence Bloom Tree (SBT), to support sequence-based querying of terabase-scale collections of thousands of short-read sequencing experiments. We apply SBT to the problem of finding conditions under which query transcripts are expressed. Our experiments are conducted on a set of 2652 publicly available RNA-seq experiments contained in the NIH for the breast, blood, and brain tissues, comprising 5 terabytes of sequence. SBTs of this size can be queried for a 1000 nt sequence in 19 minutes using less than 300 MB of RAM, over 100 times faster than standard usage of SRA-BLAST and 119 times faster than STAR. SBTs allow for fast identification of experiments with expressed novel isoforms, even if these isoforms were unknown at the time the SBT was built. We also provide some theoretical guidance about appropriate parameter selection in SBT and propose a sampling-based scheme for potentially scaling SBT to even larger collections of files. While SBT can handle any set of reads, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SBT by searching a large collection of blood, brain, and breast RNA-seq files for all 214,293 known human transcripts to identify tissue-specific transcripts.\n\nThe implementation used in the experiments below is in C++ and is available as open source at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/[~]ckingsf/software/bloomtree."

Although the catalog of known AS events has grown ever since, novel transcripts are commonly observed when working with less well annotated organisms, in the context of disease, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete transcripts is technically challenging and computationally expensive, focusing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful and sufficient for a wide range of analyses.\n\nResults: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences between samples.

Here, we mutated an invertebrate orphan relaxin receptor, the Drosophila Lgr3, and found body asymmetries similar to those found in insulin/relaxin-like peptide 8 (dilp8) mutants, which fail to coordinate growth with developmental timing. Indeed, mutation or RNAi against Lgr3 suppresses the delay in pupariation induced by imaginal disc growth perturbation or ectopic Dilp8 expression. By fluorescently-tagging the endogenous Lgr3 protein and performing CNS-specific RNAi, we find that Lgr3 is expressed and required in a novel subset of CNS neurons to transmit the peripheral tissue stress signal, Dilp8, to the neuroendocrine centers controlling developmental timing. Our work sheds new light on the function and evolution of relaxin receptors and reveals a novel neuroendocrine circuit responsive to growth aberrations."
10.1101/017152,"Even in the best studied Mammalian genomes, less than 5% of the total genome length is annotated as exonic. However, deep sequencing analysis in humans has shown that around 40% of the genome may be covered by poly-adenylated non-coding transcripts occurring at low levels1. Their functional significance is unclear2,3, and there has been a dispute whether they should be considered as noise of the transcriptional machinery4,5. We propose that if such transcripts show some evolutionary stability they will serve as substrates for de novo gene evolution, i.e. gene emergence out of non-coding DNA6-8. Here, we characterize the phylogenetic turnover of low-level poly-adenylated transcripts in a comprehensive sampling of populations, sub-species and species of the genus Mus, spanning a phylogenetic distance of about 10 Myr. We find evidence for more evolutionary stable gains of transcription than losses among closely related taxa, balanced by a loss of older transcripts across the whole phylogeny. We show that adding taxa increases the genomic transcript coverage and that no major transcript-free islands exist over time. This suggests that the entire genome can be transcribed into polyadenylated RNA when viewed at an evolutionary time scale. Thus, any part of the \""non-coding\"" genome can become subject to evolutionary functionalization via de novo gene evolution."
10.1101/017137,"We developed a large-scale dynamical model of the macaque neocortex based on recent quantitative connectivity data. A hierarchy of timescales naturally emerges from this system: sensory areas show brief, transient responses to input (appropriate for sensory processing), whereas association areas integrate inputs over time and exhibit persistent activity (suitable for decision-making and working memory). The model displays multiple temporal hierarchies, as evidenced by contrasting responses to visual and somatosensory stimulation. Moreover, slower prefrontal and temporal areas have a disproportionate impact on global brain dynamics. These findings establish for the first time a circuit mechanism for \""temporal receptive windows\"" that are progressively enlarged along the cortical hierarchy, extend the concept of working memory from local to large circuits, and suggest a re-interpretation of functional connectivity measures.\n\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\nAcknowledgementsWe thank Nikola Markov and John Murray for discussions.

10.1101/017145,"The widely used insect repellent DEET has a limited spatial zone of protection, requiring it to be applied over all exposed areas of skin. Identification of insect DEET-sensing neurons expressing a highly conserved Ionotropic receptor, Ir40a, provides an opportunity to identify new structural classes of volatile agonists as potential spatial repellents. By imaging the activity of the Ir40a+ neurons in D. melanogaster expressing the calcium sensitive GCaMP3 protein, we identify a strong agonist, 4-methylpiperidine, with a much higher vapor pressure than DEET. Behavioral testing reveals that 4-methylpiperidine repels Aedes aegypti, which is consistent with our model that Ir40a marks a conserved innate aversive pathway. Using a spatial repellency assay we demonstrate that 4-methylpiperidine applied to one part of the hand repels mosquitoes on another part effectively, whereas DEET cannot do so. Using orco mutant A. aegypti we demonstrate that avoidance to 4- methypiperidine is not dependent on Or family function. Additional testing of orco mutant mosquitoes demonstrates that they are also effectively repelled by DEET, without coming in contact with it, in heat attraction assays. Together, these results support our initial observations that the conserved Ir pathway plays a key role in olfactory repellency and can be used to identify new classes of repellents."
10.1101/017103,"MotivationMapping high throughput sequencing data to a reference genome is an essential step for most analysis pipelines aiming at the computational analysis of genome and transcriptome sequencing data. Breaking ties between equally well mapping locations poses a severe problem not only during the alignment phase, but also has significant impact on the results of downstream analyses. We present the multimapper resolution (MMR) tool that infers optimal mapping locations from the coverage density of other mapped reads.\n\nResultsFiltering alignments with MMR can significantly improve the performance of downstream analyses like transcript quantitation and differential testing. We illustrate that the accuracy (Spear-man correlation) of transcript quantification increases by 17% when using reads of length 51. In addition, MMR decreases the alignment file sizes by more than 50% and this leads to a reduced running time of the quantification tool. Our efficient implementation of the MMR algorithm is easily applicable as a post-processing step to existing alignment files in BAM format. Its complexity scales linearly with the number of alignments and requires no further inputs.\n\nSupplementary MaterialSource code and documentation are available for download at github.com/ratschlab/mmr.

10.1101/017129,"Learning how complex traits like eyes originate is fundamental for understanding evolution. Here, we first sketch historical perspectives on trait origins and argue that new technologies offer key new insights. Next, we articulate four open questions about trait origins. To address them, we define a research program to break complex traits into components and study the individual evolutionary histories of those parts. By doing so, we can learn when the parts came together and perhaps understand why they stayed together. We apply the approach to five structural innovations critical for complex eyes, reviewing the history of the parts of each of those innovations. Photoreceptors evolved within animals by bricolage, recombining genes that originated far earlier. Multiple genes used in eyes today had ancestral roles in stress responses. We hypothesize that photo-stress could have increased the chance those genes were expressed together in places on animals where light was abundant."
10.1101/017160,"BackgroundNucleic acids quantification by amplification is currently done primarily by real-time amplification for relative quantification, or by statistical inference from replicated endpoint assays for absolute quantification. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the dominant amplification technology, although alternative isothermal technologies have been described. Theoretical analysis of amplification kinetics and of amplification data interpretation have almost exclusively considered the PCR.\n\nResultsReal-time measurements of isothermal amplification reactions can be made continuously, in contrast to the discrete per-cycle measurements of real-time PCR. Isothermal ramified rolling circle amplification (RAM) reactions were measured at frequent intervals, and amplification data subsets were fitted to an exponential amplification model. Signal-change-over-time slopes and time-zero signal intercepts were derived from the chosen subset data. Slope measurements were sufficient to determine a reaction rate (the isothermal equivalent of PCR efficiency) for each reaction. Analysis of slope and intercept together suggest that amplification reactions that were initiated from a single target molecule can be distinguished from reactions that that were initiated from greater than one target molecule.\n\nConclusionsThe constant reaction environment of isothermal nucleic acid amplification allows continuous monitoring of reaction rate. Functional regions of interest in real-time data can be determined directly from the data. Accurate per-reaction efficiency can be readily measured. Improved estimation of low target copy number should improve quantification efficiency."
10.1101/017194,"Resolution of complex repeat structures and rearrangements in the assembly and analysis of large eukaryotic genomes is often aided by a combination of high-throughput sequencing and mapping technologies (e.g. optical restriction mapping). In particular, mapping technologies can generate sparse maps of large DNA fragments (150 kbp-2 Mbp) and thus provide a unique source of information for disambiguating complex rearrangements in cancer genomes. Despite their utility, combining high-throughput sequencing and mapping technologies has been challenging due to the lack of efficient and freely available software for robustly aligning maps to sequences. Here we introduce two new map-to-sequence alignment algorithms that efficiently and accurately align high-throughput mapping datasets to large, eukaryotic genomes while accounting for high error rates. In order to do so, these methods (OPTIMA for glocal and OPTIMA-Overlap for overlap alignment) exploit the ability to create efficient data structures that index continuous-valued mapping data while accounting for errors. We also introduce an approach for evaluating the significance of alignments that avoids expensive permutation-based tests while being agnostic to technology-dependent error rates. Our benchmarking results suggest that OPTIMA and OPTIMA-Overlap outperform state-of-the-art approaches in sensitivity (1.6-2x improvement) while simultaneously being more efficient (170-200%) and precise in their alignments (99% precision). These advantages are independent of the quality of the data, suggesting that our indexing approach and statistical evaluation are robust and provide improved sensitivity while guaranteeing high precision."
10.1101/017178,"In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread."
10.1101/016493,"Studying the evolutionary dynamics of an alien species surviving and continuing to expand after several generations can provide fundamental information on the relevant features of clearly successful invasions. Here, we tackle this task by investigating the dynamics of the genetic diversity in invasive crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) populations, introduced to Italy about 1500 years ago, which are still growing in size, distribution range and ecological niche. Using genome-wide RAD markers, we describe the structure of the genetic diversity and the demographic dynamics of the H. cristata invasive populations and compare their genetic diversity with that of native African populations of both H. cristata and its sister species, H. africaeaustralis. First, we demonstrate that genetic diversity is lower in both the invasive Italian and the North Africa source range relative to other native populations from Sub-Saharan and South Africa. Second, we find evidence of multiple introduction events in the invasive range followed by very limited gene flow. Through coalescence-based demographic reconstructions, we also show that the bottleneck at introduction was mild and did not affect the introduced genetic diversity. Finally, we reveal that the current spatial expansion at the northern boundary of the range is following a leading-edge model characterized by a general reduction of genetic diversity towards the edge of the expanding range. We conclude that the level of genome-wide diversity of H. cristata invasive populations is less important in explaining its successful invasion than species-specific life-history traits or the phylogeographic history in the native source range."
10.1101/017186,"Using targeted genetical genomics, a QTL affecting the initial post-mortem pH value of chicken breast muscle (Pectoralis major) on chromosome 1 (GGA1) was recently fine-mapped. Thirteen genes were present in the QTL region of about 1 Mb.\n\nIn this study, ten birds that were inferred to be homozygous for either the high (QQ) or low (qq) QTL allele were selected for re-sequencing. After enrichment for 1 Mb around the QTL region, > 200 x coverage for the QTL region in each of the ten birds was obtained. We used custom tools to identify putative causal mutations in the mapped QTL region from next generation sequence data. Four non-synonymous SNPs differentiating the two QTL genotype groups were identified within four local genes (PRDX4, EIF2S3, PCYT1B and E1BTD2). These were defined to be most likely candidate SNPs to explain the QTL effect. Moreover, 29 consensus SNPs were detected within gene-related regions (UTR regions and splicing sites) for the QQ birds and 26 for the qq birds. These could also play a role explaining the observed QTL effect.\n\nThe results provide an important step for prioritizing among a large amount of candidate mutations and significantly contribute to the understanding of the genetic mechanisms affecting the initial post-mortem pH value of chicken muscle."
10.1101/017210,"Both spatial and directional information are necessary for navigation. Rodent hippocampal neurons show spatial selectivity in all environments1, but directional tuning only on linear paths2-8.The sensory mechanisms underlying directionality are unknown, though vestibular and visual cues are thought to be crucial. However, hippocampal neurons are thought to show no angular modulation during two-dimensional random foraging despite the presence of vestibular and visual cues6,7. Additionally, specific aspects of visual cues have not been directly linked to hippocampal responses in rodents. To resolve these issues we manipulated vestibular and visual cues in a series of experiments. We first measured hippocampal activity during random foraging in real world (RW) where we found that neurons firing exhibited significant modulation by head-direction. In fact, the fraction of modulated neurons was comparable to that in the head-direction system9. These findings are contrary to commonly held beliefs about hippocampal directionality6,7. To isolate the contribution of visual cues we measured neural responses in a visually similar virtual reality (VR) where the range of vestibular inputs is minimized5,10,11. Significant directional modulation was not only found in VR, but it was comparable to that in RW. Several additional experiments revealed that changes in the angular information contained in the visual cues induced corresponding changes in hippocampal head-directional modulation. Remarkably, for head-directionally modulated neurons, the ensemble activity was biased towards the sole visual cue. These results demonstrate that robust vestibular cues are not required for hippocampal directional selectivity, while visual cues are not only sufficient but also play a causal role in driving hippocampal responses."

However, the observed ribosome profile is fundamentally confounded by transcriptional activity. In order to decipher principles of translation regulation, tools that can reliably detect changes in translation efficiency in case-control studies are needed.\n\nResultsWe present a statistical framework and analysis tool, RiboDiff, to detect genes with changes in translation efficiency across experimental treatments. RiboDiff uses generalized linear models to estimate the over-dispersion of RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling measurements separately, and performs a statistical test for differential translation efficiency using both mRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy.\n\nAvailabilityRiboDiff webpage http://bioweb.me/ribodiff.

10.1101/017251,"Poised (bivalent or paused) chromatin comprises activating and repressing histone modifications at the same location (Voigt et al., 2013). This combination of epigenetic marks keeps genes expressed at low levels but poised for rapid activation (Margaritis and Holstege, 2008; Mikkelsen et al., 2007). Typically, DNA at poised promoters carries low levels of methylation in normal cells (Meissner et al., 2008; Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015), but frequently shows elevated methylation levels in cancer samples (Hinoue et al., 2012; Gal-Yam et al., 2008; Ohm et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2008; Easwaran et al., 2012). Although higher levels of methylation are normally associated with transcriptional silencing, recently counter-intuitive positive correlations between methylation and expression levels have been reported for two cancer types (Hahn et al., 2014; Kretzmer et al.,). Here, we analyze one of the largest combined expression and methylation data-sets to date, comprising over 5,000 samples and demonstrate that the hypermethylation of poised chromatin in conjunction with up-regulation of the corresponding genes is a general phenomenon in cancer. This up-regulation affects developmental genes and transcription factors, including many genes implicated in cancer. From analysis of 7,000 methylation data sets, we built a universal classifier that can identify cancer samples solely from the hypermethylation status of originally poised chromatin. We reason that the alteration of the epigenetic status of poised chromatin is intimately linked to tumorigenesis."
10.1101/017244,"We analyse patterns of genetic variability of populations in the presence of a large seed bank with the help of a new coalescent structure called the seed bank coalescent. This ancestral process appears naturally as scaling limit of the genealogy of large populations that sustain seed banks, if the seed bank size and individual dormancy times are of the same order as the active population. Mutations appear as Poisson processes on the active lineages, and potentially at reduced rate also on the dormant lineages. The presence of  dormant lineages leads to qualitatively altered times to the most recent common ancestor and non-classical patterns of genetic diversity. To illustrate this we provide a Wright-Fisher model with seed bank component and mutation, motivated from recent models of microbial dormancy, whose genealogy can be described by the seed bank coalescent. Based on our coalescent model, we derive recursions for the expectation and variance of the time to most recent common ancestor, number of segregating sites, pairwise differences, and singletons. Estimates (obtained by simulations) of the distributions of commonly employed distance statistics, in the presence and absence of a seed bank, are compared. The effect of a seed bank on the expected site-frequency spectrum is also investigated using simulations. Our results indicate that the presence of a large seed bank considerably alters the distribution of some distance statistics, as well as the site-frequency spectrum. Thus, one should be able to detect the presence of a large seed bank in genetic data."
10.1101/017277,"Using robust, integrated analysis of multiple genomic datasets, we show that genes depleted for non-synonymous de novo mutations form a subnetwork of 72 members under strong selective constraint. We further show this subnetwork is preferentially expressed in the early development of the human hippocampus and is enriched for genes mutated in neurological, but not other, Mendelian disorders. We thus conclude that carefully orchestrated developmental processes are under strong constraint in early brain development, and perturbations caused by mutation have adverse outcomes subject to strong purifying selection. Our findings demonstrate that selective forces can act on groups of genes involved in the same process, supporting the notion that adaptation can act coordinately on multiple genes. Our approach provides a statistically robust, interpretable way to identify the tissues and developmental times where groups of disease genes are active. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the interactions between genes when analyzing genome-wide sequence data."
10.1101/016816,"Initiation of the adaptive immune response is dependent on the priming of naive T cells by APCs. Proteomic analysis of unactivated and activated human NK cell membrane-enriched fractions demonstrated that activated NK cells can efficiently stimulate T cells, since they upregulate MHC class II molecules and multiple ligands for TCR costimulatory molecules. Furthermore, by manipulating antigen administration, we show that NK cells possess multiple independent unique pathways for antigen uptake. These results highlight NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and specific ligand recognition by cell surface-activating receptors on NK cells as unique mechanisms for antigen capturing and presentation. In addition, we analyzed the T cell-activating potential of human NK cells derived from different clinical conditions, such as inflamed tonsils and noninfected and CMV-infected uterine decidual samples, and from transporter-associated processing antigen 2-deficient patients. This in vivo analysis revealed that proinflammatory, but not immune-suppressive, microenvironmental requirements can selectively dictate upregulation of T cell-activating molecules on NK cells. Taken together, these observations offer new and unexpected insights into the direct interactions between NK and T cells and suggest novel APC-like activating functions for human NK cells.\n\nNonstandard abbreviations used"
10.1101/017202,"Evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle, yet only daytime transpiration is currently considered in Earth system and agricultural sciences. This contrasts with physiological studies where 25% or more of water losses have been reported to occur occurring overnight at leaf and plant scales. This gap probably arose from limitations in techniques to measure nocturnal water fluxes at ecosystem scales, a gap we bridge here by using lysimeters under controlled environmental conditions. The magnitude of the nocturnal water losses (12-23% of daytime water losses) in row-crop monocultures of bean (annual herb) and cotton (woody shrub) would be globally an order of magnitude higher than documented responses of global evapotranspiration to climate change (51-98 vs. 7-8 mm yr-1). Contrary to daytime responses and to conventional wisdom, nocturnal transpiration was not affected by previous radiation loads or carbon uptake, and showed a temporal pattern independent of vapour pressure deficit or temperature, because of endogenous controls on stomatal conductance via circadian regulation. Our results have important implications from large-scale ecosystem modelling to crop production: homeostatic water losses justify simple empirical predictive functions, and circadian controls show a fine-tune control that minimizes water loss while potentially increasing posterior carbon uptake."
10.1101/017301,"To explore the interplay between new mutation, transmission, and gender bias in genetic disease requires formal quantitative modeling. Autism spectrum disorders offer an ideal case: they are genetic in origin, complex, and show a gender bias. The high reproductive costs of autism ensure that most strongly associated genetic mutations are short-lived, and indeed the disease exhibits both transmitted and de novo components. There is a large body of both epidemiologic and genomic data that greatly constrain the genetic mechanisms that may contribute to the disorder. We develop a computational framework that assumes classes of additive variants, each member of a class having equal effect. We restrict our initial exploration to single class models, each having three parameters. Only one model matches epidemiological data. It also independently matches the incidence of de novo mutation in simplex families, the gender bias in unaffected siblings in simplex populations, and rates of mutation in target genes. This model makes strong and as yet not fully tested predictions, namely that females are the primary carriers in cases of genetic transmission, and that the incidence of de novo mutation in target genes for families at high risk for autism are not especially elevated. In its simplicity, this model does not account for MZ twin concordance or the distorted gender bias of high functioning children with ASD, and does not accommodate all the known mechanisms contributing to ASD. We point to the next steps in applying the same computational framework to explore more complex models.\n\nAuthor summaryFor understanding complex genetic diseases one needs both data and molecular/genetic models. In the absence of any model, it is impossible to do more than summarize observations. A good model will be consistent with much or all of the existing data and puts the data in the context of known genetic principles. Ideally the model will make testable predictions. Where the good models fail often shows the directions that require more thought about mechanisms. In this paper we describe a new computational framework that we use to explore a complex genetic disorder with many gene targets, with both de novo and transmitted variants, and with gender bias. The disorder we consider is autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and our framework rules out some previous models that make unsustainable predictions. We identify a formal model that satisfies diverse epidemiologic and genomic observations. This model makes strong and untested predictions and thereby suggests new studies that would resolve outstanding aspects of autism genetics."
10.1101/016931,"Root systems develop different root types that individually sense cues from their local environment and integrate this information with systemic signals. This complex multidimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integrated imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes."
10.1101/017285,"BackgroundGlobal increase in ambient temperatures constitute a significant challenge to wild and cultivated plant species. Forward genetic analyses of individual temperature-responsive traits have resulted in the identification of several signaling and response components. However, a comprehensive knowledge about temperature sensitivity of different developmental stages and the contribution of natural variation is still scarce and fragmented at best.\n\nResultsHere, we systematically analyze thermomorphogenesis throughout a complete life cycle in ten natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown in four different temperatures ranging from 16 to 28 {degrees}C. We used Q10, GxE, phenotypic divergence and correlation analyses to assess temperature sensitivity and genotype effects of more than 30 morphometric and developmental traits representing five phenotype classes. We found that genotype and temperature differentially affected plant growth and development with variing strengths. Furthermore, overall correlations among phenotypic temperature responses was relatively low which seems to be caused by differential capacities for temperature adaptations of individual accessions.\n\nConclusionGenotype-specific temperature responses may be attractive targets for future forward genetic approaches and accession-specific thermomorphogenesis maps may aid the assessment of functional relevance of known and novel regulatory components."
10.1101/017269,"Biomolecular temperature sensors can be used for efficient control of large-volume bioreactors, for spatiotemporal control and imaging of gene expression, as well as to engineer robustness to temperature in biomolecular circuit design. While RNA-based sensors, called  thermometers, have been investigated in natural and synthetic contexts, an important challenge is to design different responses to temperature, differing in sensitivities and thresholds. We address this issue using experimental measurements in cells and in cell-free biomolecular  breadboards in combination with computations of RNA thermodynamics. We designed a library of RNA thermometers, finding, computationally, that it could contain a multiplicity of responses to temperature. We constructed this library and found a wide range of responses to temperature, ranging from 3.5-fold to over 10-fold in the temperature range 29{degrees}C - 37{degrees}C. These were largely linear responses with over 10-fold difference in slopes. We correlated the measured responses with computational expectations, finding that while there was no strong correlation in the individual values, the overall trends were similar. These results present a toolbox of RNA-based circuit elements with varying temperature sensitivities."
10.1101/016667,"The evolution of cooperation--costly behavior that benefits others--faces one clear obstacle. Namely, cooperators are always at a competitive disadvantage relative to defectors, individuals that reap the same social benefits, but evade the personal cost. One solution to this problem involves genetic hitchhiking, where the allele encoding cooperative behavior becomes linked to a beneficial mutation. While traditionally seen as a passive process driven purely by chance, here we explore a more active form of hitchhiking. Specifically, we model hitchhiking in the context of adaptation to a stressful environment by cooperators and defectors with spatially limited dispersal. Under such conditions, clustered cooperators reach higher local densities, thereby experiencing more opportunities for mutations than defectors. Thus, the allele encoding cooperation has a greater probability of hitchhiking with alleles conferring stress adaptation. We label this probabilistic enhancement the \""Hankshaw effect\"" after the character Sissy Hankshaw, whose anomalously large thumbs made her a singularly effective hitchhiker. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that there exists a broad set of conditions allowing the evolution of cooperation through the Hankshaw effect. We discuss the feasibility of our theoretical assumptions for natural systems, not only for the case of cooperation, but also for other costly social behaviors such as spite. The primary elements of our model, including genetic hitchhiking and population structure, have been discussed separately in previous models exploring the evolution of cooperation. However, the combination of these elements has not been appreciated as a solution to the problem of cooperation."
10.1101/017343,"High quality Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes are revealing which regions of archaic hominin DNA have persisted in the modern human genome. A number of these regions are associated with response to infection and immunity, with a suggestion that derived Neanderthal alleles found in modern Europeans and East Asians may be associated with autoimmunity. Independent sources of DNA-based evidence allow a re-evaluation of the nature and timing of the first epidemiologic transition. By combining skeletal, archaeological and genetic evidence we question whether the first epidemiologic transition in Eurasia was as tightly tied to the onset of the Holocene as has previously been assumed. There clear evidence to suggest that this transition began before the appearance of agriculture and occurred over a timescale of tens of thousands of years. The transfer of pathogens between human species may also have played a role in the extinction of the Neanderthals."
10.1101/017319,"White-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans1, has spread west from New York to Missouri and has killed more than six million bats2. In bat hibernacula where WNS is present, mass mortality has been observed and there is a high potential for population collapse or extinction of some species at a regional level. Although WNS is not yet present in the western U.S., the high diversity ofbat species3 and appropriate conditions for P. destructans in area caves may put these populations at risk. The absence of WNS in western caves provides a unique opportunity to ask questions about how bat species, geographic location, and habitat shape pre-WNS bat microbiota. The importance of microbiota is shown in many organisms, including amphibians, where individuals that survive a chytrid infection carry a higher prevalence of Janthinobacterium lividum4. The establishment of a pre-WNS baseline microbiota of western bats is critical to understanding how P. destructans may impact the native microbiota of the bats. Previous studies5,6 that identified the microbiota of bats have focused on gut and fecal microbiota, with little attention given to the external microbiota. Here we show for the first time that habitat and geography influence differences in the abundance and diversity of external bat microbiota. From our 202 (62 cave-netted, 140 surface-netted) bat samples belonging to 13 species of western bats uninfected with WNS, we identified differences in microbiota diversity among sites, and between cave-netted versus surface-netted bats, regardless of sex and species. These results present novel information about the factors that shape external microbiota of bats providing new insights into patterns of diversity in a pre-WNS bat population."
10.1101/017418,"Crossvalidation is a method for estimating predictive performance and adjudicating between multiple models. On each of k folds of the process, k-1 of k independent subsets of the data (training set) are used to fit the parameters of each model and the left-out subset (test set) is used to estimate predictive performance. The method is statistically efficient, because training data are reused for testing and performance estimates combined across folds. The method requires no assumptions, provides nearly unbiased (slightly conservative) estimates of predictive performance, and is generally applicable because it amounts to a direct empirical test of each model."
10.1101/017327,"The problems with classical frequentist statistics have recently received much attention, yet the enthusiasm of researchers to adopt alternatives like Bayesian inference remains modest. Here I present the bootstrapped evidence test, an objective resampling procedure that takes the precision with which both the experimental and null hypothesis can be estimated into account. Simulations and reanalysis of actual experimental data demonstrate that this test minimizes false positives while maintaining sensitivity. It is equally applicable to a wide range of situations and thus minimizes problems arising from analytical flexibility. Critically, it does not dichotomize the results based on an arbitrary significance level but instead quantifies how well the data support either the alternative or the null hypothesis. It is thus particularly useful in situations with considerable uncertainty about the expected effect size. Because it is non-parametric, it is also robust to severe violations of assumptions made by classical statistics."
10.1101/017350,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research is routinely criticized for being statistically underpowered due to characteristically small sample sizes and much larger sample sizes are being increasingly recommended. Additionally, various sources of artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24% in regions canonically associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts (40-149%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. This effect size boosting is primarily a consequence of reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level, which then translates into consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level. Power simulations demonstrate that enhanced effect size enables highly-powered studies at traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could help issues regarding statistical power and non-BOLD noise and enable potential for novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are currently under-appreciated and not well understood."
10.1101/017426,"In this study the experimental isotherm data of biosorption of Pb(II) onto algae was modeled using several models. These models are: Langmuir, Hill-Sips, Brouers-Sotolongo, Brouers-Gaspard, and Redlich-Peterson models. The coefficients of each model were determined by non-linear fitting using Mathematica9 program. The maximum Pb(II) removal rate increased with the increase of temperature and reached the maximum value (98%) at the temperature of 40 {degrees}C. Even if the R2 error quantity is not the unique and always the best measure for nonlinear fitting, the Brouers-Sotolongo model gives in all cases the best fit and is definitely the most suitable one to satisfactorily describe bioisorption of Pb(II) on the algal biomass. In addition, this study shows that a complete set of data is necessary to have a good representation of the isotherm."
10.1101/017392,"The majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in noncoding regions of the genome with regulatory roles. Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of GWAS studies. We present GERV (Generative Evaluation of Regulatory Variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factors canonical motif as well as associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting SNPs associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked SNPs, and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally an-notating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis. The implementation of GERV and related data are available at http://gerv.csail.mit.edu/"
10.1101/017376,"Identification of protein complexes from proteomic experiments is crucial to understand not only their function but also the principles of cellular organization. Advances in experimental techniques have enabled the construction of large-scale protein-protein interaction networks, and computational methods have been developed to analyze high-throughput data. In most cases several parameters are introduced that have to be trained before application. But how do we select the parameter values when there are no training data available? How many data do we need to properly train a method. How is the performance of a method affected when we incorrectly select the parameter values? The above questions, although important to determine the applicability of a method, are most of the time over-looked. We highlight the importance of such an analysis by investigating how limited knowledge, in the form of incomplete training data, affects the performance of parametric protein-complex prediction algorithms. Furthermore, we develop a simple non-parametric method that does not rely on the existence of training data and we compare it with the parametric alternatives. Using datasets from yeast and fly we demonstrate that parametric methods trained with limited data provide sub-optimal predictions, while our non-parametric method performs better or is on par with the parametric alternatives. Overall, our analysis questions, at least for the specific problem, whether parametric methods provide significantly better results than non-parametric ones to justify the additional effort for applying them."
10.1101/017368,"AimTo assess the extent to which humans have reshaped Earths biodiversity, by estimating natural ranges of all late Quaternary mammalian species, and to compare diversity patterns based on these with diversity patterns based on current distributions.\n\nLocationGlobally\n\nMethodsWe estimated species, functional and phylogenetic diversity patterns based on natural ranges of all mammalian species (n=5747 species) as they could have been today in the complete absence of human influence through time. Following this we compared macroecological analyses of current and natural diversity patterns to assess if human-induced range changes bias for evolutionary and ecological analyses based on current diversity patterns.\n\nResultsWe find that current diversity patterns have been drastically modified by humans, mostly due to global extinctions and regional to local extirpations. Current and natural diversities exhibit marked deviations virtually everywhere outside sub-Saharan Africa. These differences are strongest for terrestrial megafauna, but also important for all mammals combined. The human-induced changes led to biases in estimates of environmental diversity drivers, especially for terrestrial megafauna, but also for all mammals combined.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results show that fundamental diversity patterns have been reshaped by human-driven extinctions and extirpations, highlighting humans as a major force in the Earth system. We thereby emphasize that estimating natural distributions and diversities is important to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and ecologically drivers of diversity as well as for providing a benchmark for conservation."
10.1101/017434,"Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of rare Mendelian conditions characterized by multiple pterygia, scoliosis and congenital contractures of the limbs. MPS typically segregates as an autosomal recessive disorder but rare instances of autosomal dominant transmission have been reported. While several mutations causing recessive MPS have been identified, the genetic basis of dominant MPS remains unknown. We identified four families with dominantly transmitted MPS characterized by pterygia, camptodactyly of the hands, vertebral fusions, and scoliosis. Exome sequencing identified predicted protein-altering mutations in embryonic myosin heavy chain (MYH3) in three families. MYH3 mutations underlie distal arthrogryposis types 1, 2A and 2B, but all mutations reported to date occur in the head and neck domains. In contrast, two of the mutations found to cause MPS occurred in the tail domain. The phenotypic overlap among persons with MPS coupled with physical findings distinct from other conditions caused by mutations in MYH3, suggests that the developmental mechanism underlying MPS differs from other conditions and / or that certain functions of embryonic myosin may be perturbed by disruption of specific residues / domains. Moreover, the vertebral fusions in persons with MPS coupled with evidence of MYH3 expression in bone suggests that embryonic myosin plays a previously unknown role in skeletal development."
10.1101/017384,"CRISPR/Cas technology allows rapid, site-specific genome modification in a wide variety of organisms. CRISPR components produced by integrated transgenes have been shown to mutagenise some genomic target sites in Drosophila melanogaster with high efficiency, but whether this is a general feature of this system remains unknown. Here, we systematically evaluate available CRISPR/Cas reagents and experimental designs in Drosophila. Our findings allow evidence-based choices of Cas9 sources and strategies for generating knock-in alleles. We perform gene editing at a large number of target sites using a highly active Cas9 line and a collection of transgenic gRNA strains. The vast majority of target sites can be mutated with remarkable efficiency using these tools. We contrast our method to recently developed autonomous gene drive technology for genome engineering (Gantz & Bier, 2015) and conclude that optimised CRISPR with independent transgenes is as efficient, more versatile and does not represent a biosafety risk."
10.1101/017459,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are a key tool to dissect cellular processes mediating complex diseases. However, little is known about the role of repetitive elements as eQTLs. We report a genome-wide survey of the contribution of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs), one of the most polymorphic and abundant repeat classes, to gene expression in humans. Our survey identified 2,060 significant expression STRs (eSTRs). These eSTRs were replicable in orthogonal populations and expression assays. We used variance partitioning to disentangle the contribution of eSTRs from linked SNPs and indels and found that eSTRs contribute 10%-15% of the cis-heritability mediated by all common variants. Functional genomic analyses showed that eSTRs are enriched in conserved regions, co-localize with regulatory elements, and are predicted to modulate histone modifications. Our results show that eSTRs provide a novel set of regulatory variants and highlight the contribution of repeats to the genetic architecture of quantitative human traits."
10.1101/017400,"Decision confidence is a forecast about the probability that a decision will be correct. Confidence can be framed as an objective mathematical quantity the Bayesian posterior probability, providing a formal definition of statistical decision confidence. Here we use this definition as a starting point to develop a normative statistical framework for decision confidence. We analytically prove interrelations between statistical decision confidence and other observable decision measures. Among these is a counterintuitive property of confidence that the lowest average confidence occurs when classifiers err in the presence of the strongest evidence. These results lay the foundations for a mathematically rigorous treatment of decision confidence that can lead to a common framework for understanding confidence across different research domains, from human behavior to neural representations."
10.1101/017509,"Ribosome profiling is a recently developed high-throughput sequencing technique that captures approximately 30 bp long ribosome-protected mRNA fragments during translation. Because of alternative splicing and repetitive sequences, a ribosome-protected read may map to many places in the transcriptome, leading to discarded or arbitrary mappings when standard approaches are used. We present a technique and software that addresses this problem by assigning reads to potential origins proportional to estimated transcript abundance. This yields a more accurate estimate of ribosome profiles compared with a na{iota}ve mapping. Ribomap is available as open source at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/[~]ckingsf/software/ribomap."
10.1101/017467,"Ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services to society. Ignoring the multi-functionality of land systems in natural resource management generates potentially trade-offs with respect to the provisioning of ecosystem services. Understanding relationships between ecosystem services can therefore help to minimize undesired trade-offs and enhance synergies. The research on relationships between ecosystem services has recently gained increasing attention in the scientific community. However, a synthesis on existing knowledge and knowledge gaps is missing so far. We analyzed 67 case studies that studied 476 pairwise combinations of ecosystem services. The relationships between these pairs of ecosystem services were classified into three categories: \""trade-off\"", \""synergy\"" or \""no-effect\"". Most pairs of ecosystem services (74%) had a clear association with one category: the majority of case studies reported similar relationships for pairs of ecosystem services. A synergistic relationship was dominant between different regulating services and between different cultural services, whereas the relationship between regulating and provisioning services was trade-off dominated. Increases in cultural services did not influence provisioning services (\""no-effect\""). We further analyzed the pattern of relationships between ecosystem services across scales, land system archetypes and methods used to determine the relationship. Our analysis showed that the overall pattern of relationships between ecosystem services did not change significantly with scale and land system archetypes. However, some pairs of ecosystem services showed changes in relationships with scale. The choice of methods used to determine the relationship had an effect on the direction of the relationship: studies that employed correlation coefficients showed an increased probability to identify no-effect relationships, whereas descriptive methods had a higher probability of identifying trade-offs. The regional scale was the most commonly considered, and case studies were biased among different land system archetypes which might affect our ability to find the effect of scale or land system archetypes on the pattern of relationships. Our results provide helpful information of which services to include in ecosystem services assessments for the scientific community as well as for practitioners. Furthermore, they allow a first check if critical trade-offs have been considered in an analysis."
10.1101/017525,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPredators often consume multiple prey and by mutually subsidizing a shared predator, the prey may reciprocally harm each other. When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predators attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence-permanence-for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states."
10.1101/017533,"Differences among clades in their diversification patterns result from a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In this study I examined the role of intrinsic factors in the morphological diversification of ruminants in general, and in the differences between bovids and cervids in particular. Using skull morphology, which embodies many of the adaptations that distinguish bovids and cervids, I examined 132 of the 200 extant ruminant species. As a proxy for intrinsic constraints I quantified different aspects of the phenotypic covariation structure within species, and compared them with the among-species divergence patterns, using phylogenetic comparative methods. My results show that for most species, divergence is well aligned with their phenotypic covariance matrix, and those that are better aligned have diverged further away from their ancestor. Bovids have dispersed into a wider range of directions in morphospace than cervids, and their overall disparity is higher. This difference is best explained by the lower eccentricity of bovids within-species covariance matrices. These results are consistent with the role of intrinsic constraints in determining amount, range, and direction of dispersion, and demonstrate that intrinsic constraints can influence macroevolutionary patterns even as the covariance structure evolves."
10.1101/017475,"Although initial studies suggested that Denisovan ancestry was found only in modern human populations from island Southeast Asia and Oceania, more recent studies have suggested that Denisovan ancestry may be more widespread. However, the geographic extent of Denisovan ancestry has not been determined, and moreover the relationship between the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania and that elsewhere has not been studied. Here we analyze genome-wide SNP data from 2493 individuals from 221 worldwide populations, and show that there is a widespread signal of a very low level of Denisovan ancestry across Eastern Eurasian and Native American (EE/NA) populations. We also verify a higher level of Denisovan ancestry in Oceania than that in EE/NA; the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania is correlated with the amount of New Guinea ancestry, but not the amount of Australian ancestry, indicating that recent gene flow from New Guinea likely accounts for signals of Denisovan ancestry across Oceania. However, Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA populations is equally correlated with their New Guinea or their Australian ancestry, suggesting a common source for the Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA and Oceanian populations. Our results suggest that Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA is derived either from common ancestry with, or gene flow from, the common ancestor of New Guineans and Australians, indicating a more complex history involving East Eurasians and Oceanians than previously suspected."
10.1101/017483,"The innate immune system provides the first response to pathogen infection and orchestrates the activation of the adaptive immune system. Though a large component of the innate immune response is common to all infections, pathogen-specific responses have been documented as well. The innate immune response is thought to be especially critical for fighting infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). While TB can be deadly, only 5-10% of individuals infected with MTB develop active disease. The risk for disease susceptibility is, at least partly, heritable. Studies of inter-individual variation in the innate immune response to MTB infection may therefore shed light on the genetic basis for variation in susceptibility to TB. Yet, to date, we still do not know which properties of the innate immune response are specific to MTB infection and which represent a general response to pathogen infection. To begin addressing this gap, we infected macrophages with eight different bacteria, including different MTB strains and related mycobacteria, and studied the transcriptional response to infection. Although the ensued gene regulatory responses were largely consistent across the bacterial infection treatments, we were able to identify a novel subset of genes whose regulation was affected specifically by infection with mycobacteria. Genetic variants that are associated with regulatory differences in these genes should be considered candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility TB.\n\nAuthor SummaryTuberculosis (TB) is a deadly disease responsible for millions of deaths annually. It is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an ancient human pathogen. Approximately a third of the worlds population is infected with MTB, yet only an estimated 5-10% of individuals will develop an active form of the disease. While this variation in TB susceptibility has been demonstrated to be heritable, we still know little about its underlying genetic basis. The genetic variation that affects TB susceptibility likely involves the innate immune system, which is our first line of defense against invading pathogens, because infection with MTB does not prevent future infections. However, we do not fully understand how the innate immune system differs in its response to MTB versus other bacteria. To investigate this further, we infected macrophages with MTB, related mycobacteria, and other bacteria, and measured how their gene expression levels changed in response. We identified a subset of genes that respond preferentially to infection with mycobacterial species. These genes provide insight into the interactions between MTB and the innate immune system and are candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility to TB."
10.1101/017582,"Identification of altered pathways that are clinically relevant across human cancers is a key challenge in cancer genomics. We developed a network-based algorithm to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers. We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic mutations in 4,790 cancer patients with 19 different types of malignancies. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and drug targets. Consensus clustering using gene expression datasets that included 4,870 patients from TCGA and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were identified because they had specific altered pathways for which there are available targeted therapies. These findings could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal."
10.1101/017624,"Landscapes exhibiting multiple secondary structures arise in natural RNA molecules that modulate gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral infection, but it is unclear whether such rich landscapes are special features of biological sequences or whether they can arise without explicit selection. We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNAs multiple alternative secondary structures as they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M2) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on noncoding RNAs with complex landscapes, M2-REEFFIT recovers 95% of RNA helices present with at least 25% population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10%) and conservative error estimates. In experimental benchmarks, M2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA fourway junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization."
10.1101/017632,"Cnidaria, the sister group to Bilateria, is a highly diverse group of animals in terms of morphology, lifecycles, ecology, and development. How this diversity originated and evolved is not well understood because phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages are unclear, and recent studies present contrasting phylogenetic hypotheses. Here, we use transcriptome data from 15 newly-sequenced species in combination with 26 publicly available genomes and transcriptomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages. Phylogenetic analyses using different partition schemes and models of molecular evolution, as well as topology tests for alternative phylogenetic relationships, support the monophyly of Medusozoa, Anthozoa, Octocorallia, Hydrozoa, and a clade consisting of Staurozoa, Cubozoa, and Scyphozoa. Support for the monophyly of Hexacorallia is weak due to the equivocal position of Ceriantharia. Taken together, these results further resolve deep cnidarian relationships, largely support traditional phylogenetic views on relationships, and provide a historical framework for studying the evolutionary processes involved in one of the most ancient animal radiations."
10.1101/017566,"1A powerful way to detect selection in a population is by modeling local allele frequency changes in a particular region of the genome under scenarios of selection and neutrality, and finding which model is most compatible with the data. Chen et al. [2010] developed a composite likelihood method called XPCLR that uses an outgroup population to detect departures from neutrality which could be compatible with hard or soft sweeps, at linked sites near a beneficial allele. However, this method is most sensitive to recent selection and may miss selective events that happened a long time ago. To overcome this, we developed an extension of XP-CLR that jointly models the behavior of a selected allele in a three-population tree. Our method - called 3P-CLR - outperforms XP-CLR when testing for selection that occurred before two populations split from each other, and can distinguish between those events and events that occurred specifically in each of the populations after the split. We applied our new test to population genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, to search for selective sweeps that occurred before the split of Yoruba and Eurasians, but after their split from Neanderthals, and that could have led to the spread of modern-human-specific phenotypes. We also searched for sweep events that occurred in East Asians, Europeans and the ancestors of both populations, after their split from Yoruba. In both cases, we are able to confirm a number of regions identified by previous methods, and find several new candidates for selection in recent and ancient times. For some of these, we also find suggestive functional mutations that may have driven the selective events."
10.1101/017608,"BackgroundGenomic prediction aims to leverage genome-wide genetic data towards better disease diagnostics and risk scores. We have previously published a genomic risk score (GRS) for celiac disease (CD), a common and highly heritable autoimmune disease, which differentiates between CD cases and population-based controls at a clinically-relevant predictive level, improving upon other gene-based approaches. HLA risk haplotypes, particularly HLA-DQ2.5, are necessary but not sufficient for CD, with at least one HLA risk haplotype present in up to half of most Caucasian populations. Here, we assess a genomic prediction strategy that specifically targets this common genetic susceptibility subtype, utilizing a supervised learning procedure for CD that leverages known HLA-DQ2.5 risk.\n\nMethodsUsing L1/L2-regularized support-vector machines trained on large European case-control datasets, we constructed novel CD GRSs specific to individuals with HLA-DQ2.5 risk haplotypes (GRS-DQ2.5) and compared them with the predictive power of the existing CD GRS (GRS14) as well as two haplotype-based approaches, externally validating the results in a North American case-control study.\n\nResultsConsistent with previous observations, both the existing GRS14 and the GRS-DQ2.5 had better predictive performance than the HLA haplotype approaches. GRS-DQ2.5 models, based on directly genotyped or imputed markers, achieved similar levels of predictive performance (AUC = 0.718--0.73), which were substantially higher than those obtained from the DQ2.5 zygosity alone (AUC = 0.558), the HLA risk haplotype method (AUC = 0.634), or the generic GRS14 (AUC = 0.679). In a screening model of at-risk individuals, the GRS-DQ2.5 lowered the number of unnecessary follow-up tests for CD across most sensitivity levels. Relative to a baseline implicating all DQ2.5-positive individuals for follow-up, the GRS-DQ2.5 resulted in a net saving of 2.2 unnecessary follow-up tests for each justified test while still capturing 90% of DQ2.5-positive CD cases.\n\nConclusionsGenomic risk scores for CD that target genetically at-risk sub-groups improve predictive performance beyond traditional approaches and may represent a useful strategy for prioritizing individuals at increase risk of disease, thus potentially reducing unnecessary follow-up diagnostic tests."
10.1101/017590,"Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walp, 2n = 8x = 64) of Brassicaceae family is an Andean economic plant cultivated on the 4000-4500 meters central sierra in Peru. Considering the rapid uplift of central Andes occurred 5 to 10 million years ago (Mya), an evolutionary question arises on how plants like maca acquire high altitude adaptation within short geological period. Here, we report the high-quality genome assembly of maca, in which two close-spaced maca-specific whole genome duplications (WGDs, [~] 6.7 Mya) were identified. Comparative genomics between maca and close-related Brassicaceae species revealed expansions of maca genes and gene families involved in abiotic stress response, hormone signaling pathway and secondary metabolite biosynthesis via WGDs. Retention and subsequent evolution of many duplicated genes may account for the morphological and physiological changes (i.e. small leaf shape and loss of vernalization) in maca for high altitude environment. Additionally, some duplicated maca genes under positive selection were identified with functions in morphological adaptation (i.e. MYB59) and development (i.e. GDPD5 and HDA9). Collectively, the octoploid maca genome sheds light on the important roles of WGDs in plant high altitude adaptation in the Andes."
10.1101/017558,"We propose a new readout architecture for echo state networks where multiple linear readout modules are activated at distinct time points to varying degrees by a separate controller module. The controller module, like the reservoir of the echo state network, can be initialized randomly. All linear readout modules are trained through simple linear regression, which is the only adaptive step in the modified algorithm. The resulting architecture provides modest improvements on a variety of time series processing tasks (between 5 to 50% in performance metric depending on the task studied). The novel architecture is guaranteed to perform at least as accurately as a conventional linear readout. It can be utilized as a general purpose readout method when augmentations to performance relative to the standard method is needed.\n\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Tp, 07.05.Mh"

This study was designed to analyze received plasma samples and plasma samples of referred patients for HIV testing to detect HIV and HCV mono and co-infection by real time PCR and finding co-relation of viral load of both viruses. Highlight and magnify the hidden coinfection, prior to seroconversion, of HIV type-1 and Hepatitis C Virus in received samples.\n\nMethodsAnalyses were based on randomly selected 78 patients stored plasmas. Plasma samples were tested for both, HIV-type 1 and HCV viral RNA by real time PCR. Statistical formulas were used to identify men and the inter quartile range of patients age. The data were analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Study variables include gender, age and viral loads of HIV type-1 and HCV. Pearson correlation was used to evaluate any correlation in study variables.\n\nResultPrevalence of HCV was 10.3%, HIV-type 1 was 19.2% and their co-infection was 37.2 percent. Thirty three percent individuals had no infection of both viruses. Gender based distribution showed that 74.4% (58/78) sample population was male. The mono-infection and co-infection was higher in males (39.7%) and highest viral load too. There was a positive correlation (CI= 95%) between the two variables; HIV and HCV viral loads, as r = 0.736, n=29, p= 0.001.\n\nConclusionPrevalence of HIV type-1 and HCV mono-infection and co-infection was higher among males as compared to females. Increased viral load was also evident among male co-infected individuals. This study proved the emergence of HCV coinfection in HIV infected individuals, and a need for on time diagnosis and treatment."

10.1101/017665,"High Performance Computing (HPC) Best Practice offers opportunities to implement lessons learned in areas such as computational chemistry and physics in genomics workflows, specifically Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflows. In this study we will briefly describe how distributed-memory parallelism can be an important enhancement to the performance and resource utilization of NGS workflows. We will illustrate this point by showing results on the parallelization of the Inchworm module of the Trinity RNA-Seq pipeline for de novo transcriptome assembly. We show that these types of applications can scale to thousands of cores. Time scaling as well as memory scaling will be discussed at length using two RNA-Seq datasets, targeting the Mus musculus (mouse) and the Axolotl (Mexican salamander). Details about the efficient MPI communication and the impact on performance will also be shown. We hope to demonstrate that this type of parallelization approach can be extended to most types of bioinformatics workflows, with substantial benefits. The efficient, distributed-memory parallel implementation eliminates memory bottlenecks and dramatically accelerates NGS analysis. We further include a summary of programming paradigms available to the bioinformatics community, such as C++/MPI."
10.1101/017681,"The high density of frequently interacting and closely related individuals in social insects enhance pathogen transmission and establishment within colonies. Group-mediated behavior supporting immune defenses tend to decrease selection acting on immune genes. Along with low effective population sizes this will result in relaxed constraint and rapid evolution of genes of the immune system. Here we show that sociality is the main driver of selection in antiviral siRNAi genes in social bumblebees compared to their socially parasitic cuckoo bumblebees that lack a worker caste. RNAi genes show frequent positive selection at the codon level additionally supported by the occurrence of parallel evolution and their evolutionary rate is linked to their pathway specific position with genes directly interacting with viruses showing the highest rates of molecular evolution. We suggest that indeed higher pathogen load in social insects drive adaptive evolution of immune genes, if not compensated by behavior."
10.1101/017657,"Though numerous polymorphisms have been associated with risk of developing lymphoma, how these variants function to promote tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here, we report that lymphoma risk SNPs, especially in the non-Hodgkins lymphoma subtype chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are significantly enriched for co-localization with epigenetic marks of active gene regulation. These enrichments were seen in a lymphoid-specific manner for numerous ENCODE datasets, including DNase-hypersensitivity as well as multiple segmentation-defined enhancer regions. Furthermore, we identify putatively functional SNPs that are both in regulatory elements in lymphocytes and are associated with gene expression changes in blood. We developed an algorithm, UES, that uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach to calculate the enrichment of previously identified risk SNPs in various functional elements. This multiscale approach integrating multiple datasets helps disentangle the underlying biology of lymphoma, and more broadly, is generally applicable to GWAS results from other diseases as well."
10.1101/017707,"Locomotion is driven by shape changes coordinated by the nervous system through time; thus, enumerating an animals complete repertoire of shape transitions would provide a basis for a comprehensive understanding of locomotor behaviour. Here we introduce a discrete representation of behaviour in the nematode C. elegans. At each point in time, the worms posture is approximated by its closest matching template from a set of 90 postures and locomotion is represented as sequences of postures. The frequency distribution of postural sequences is heavy-tailed with a core of frequent behaviours and a much larger set of rarely used behaviours. Responses to optogenetic and environmental stimuli can be quantified as changes in postural syntax: worms show different preferences for different sequences of postures drawn from the same set of templates. A discrete representation of behaviour will enable the use of methods developed for other kinds of discrete data in bioinformatics and language processing to be harnessed for the study of behaviour.\n\nAuthor SummaryTechnology for recording neural activity is advancing rapidly and whole-brain imaging with single neuron resolution has already been demonstrated for smaller animals. To interpret such complex neural recordings, we need comprehensive characterizations of behaviour, which is the principal output of the brain. Animal tracking can increasingly be performed automatically but an outstanding challenge is finding ways to represent these behavioural data. We have focused on the movement of the nematode worm C. elegans to develop a quantitative representation of behaviour as a series of distinct postures. Each posture is analogous to a word in a language and so we can directly count the number of phrases that makes up the C. elegans behavioural repertoire. C. elegans has a very small nervous system but we find that its behavioural repertoire is still complex. As with human languages, there is a large number of possible phrases, but most are rarely used. When comparing different populations of worms or worms in different environments, we find that the difference between their behaviour is due to a subset of their entire repertoire. In the language analogy, these would correspond to idiomatic phrases that distinguish groups of speakers. A quantitative understanding of the nature of behavioural variation will inform research on the function and evolution of neural circuits."
10.1101/017699,"BackgroundComplete genome sequences provide many new characters suitable for studying phylogenetic relationships. The limitations of the single sequence-based phylogenetic reconstruction prompted the efforts to build trees based on genome-wide properties, such as the fraction of shared orthologous genes or conservation of adjoining gene pairs. Gene content-based phylogenies, however, have their own biases: most notably, differential losses and horizontal transfers of genes interfere with phylogenetic signal, each in their own way, and special measures need to be taken to eliminate these types of noise.\n\nResultsWe expand the repertoire of genome-wide traits available for phylogeny building, by developing a practical approach for measuring local gene conservation in two genomes. We counted the number of orthologous genes shared by chromosomal neighborhoods (\""bins\""), and built the phylogeny of 63 prokaryotic genomes on this basis. The tree correctly resolved all well-established clades, and also suggested the monophily of firmicutes, which tend to be split in other genome-based trees.\n\nConclusionsOur measure of local gene order conservation extracts strong phylogenetic signal. This new measure appears to be substantially resistant to the observed instances of gene loss and horizontal transfer, two evolutionary forces which can cause systematic biases in the genome-based phylogenies."
10.1101/017491,"Despite decade-long efforts, the genetic underpinnings of many complex traits and diseases remain largely elusive. It is increasingly recognized that a purely additive model, upon which most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) rely, is insufficient. Although thousands of significant trait-associated loci have been identified, purely additive models leave much of the inferred genetic variance unexplained. Several factors have been invoked to explain the  missing heritability, including epistasis. Accounting for all possible epistatic interactions is computationally complex and requires very large samples. Here, we propose a simple two-state epistasis model, in which individuals show either high or low variant penetrance with respect to a certain trait. The use of this model increases the power to detect additive trait-associated loci. We show that this model is consistent with current GWAS results and improves fit with heritability observations based on twin studies. We suggest that accounting for variant penetrance will significantly increase our power to identify underlying additive loci."
10.1101/017723,"In tropical forests, one of the most common relationships between parasites and insects is that between the fungus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Ascomycota) and ants, especially within the tribe Camponotini. These fungi have the ability to penetrate the exoskeleton of the ant and to manipulate the behavior of the host, making it leave the nest and ascend understorey shrubs, to die biting onto the vegetation: hence, the term zombie-ant fungi to describe this behavioral changes on the host. It is posited that this behavioral change aids spore dispersal and thus increases the chances of infection. Despite their undoubted importance for ecosystem functioning, these fungal pathogens are still poorly documented, especially regarding their diversity, ecology and evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe multiple new and host-specific species of the genus Ophiocordyceps on Camponotus and Polyrhachis ants from the central Amazonian region of Brazil, USA, Australia and Japan, which can readily be separated using classic taxonomic criteria, in particular ascospore morphology."
10.1101/017814,"Current methods for assembling metabolic pathways require a process of repeated trial and error and have a long design-build-test cycle. Further, it remains a challenge to precisely tune enzyme expression levels for maximizing target metabolite production. Recently it was shown that a cell-free transcriptional-translation system (TX-TL) can be used to rapidly prototype novel complex biocircuits as well as metabolic pathways. TX-TL systems allow protein expression from multiple DNA pieces, opening up the possibility of modulating concentrations of DNA encoding individual pathway enzymes and testing the related effect on metabolite production. In this work, we demonstrate TX-TL as a platform for exploring the design space of metabolic pathways using a 1,4-BDO biosynthesis pathway as an example. Using TX-TL, we verified enzyme expression and enzyme activity and identified the conversion of 4-hydroxybutyrate to downstream metabolites as a limiting step of the 1,4-BDO pathway. We further tested combinations of various enzyme expression levels and found increasing downstream enzyme expression levels improved 1,4-BDO production."
10.1101/017822,"AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPImputation of genotypes in a study sample can make use of sequenced or densely genotyped external reference panels consisting of individuals that are not from the study sample. It can also employ internal reference panels, incorporating a subset of individuals from the study sample itself. Internal panels offer an advantage over external panels, as they can reduce imputation errors arising from genetic dissimilarity between a population of interest and a second, distinct population from which the external reference panel has been constructed. As the cost of next-generation sequencing decreases, internal reference panel selection is becoming increasingly feasible. However, it is not clear how best to select individuals to include in such panels. We introduce a new method for selecting an internal reference panel--minimizing the average distance to the closest leaf (ADCL)--and compare its performance relative to an earlier algorithm: maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD). Employing both simulated data and sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that ADCL provides a significant improvement in imputation accuracy, especially for imputation of sites with low-frequency alleles. This improvement in imputation accuracy is robust to changes in reference panel size, marker density, and length of the imputation target region."

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing platforms, the use of large scale shotgun sequencing approaches is now commonplace. However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here we present a benchmark where the most widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted community composition and functional capacity.

10.1101/017731,"The central challenge in tumor sequencing studies is to identify driver genes and pathways, investigate their functional relationships and nominate drug targets. The efficiency of these analyses, particularly for infrequently mutated genes, is compromised when patients carry different combinations of driver mutations. Mutual exclusivity analysis helps address these challenges. To identify mutually exclusive gene sets (MEGS), we developed a powerful and flexible analytic framework based on a likelihood ratio test and a model selection procedure. Extensive simulations demonstrated that our method outperformed existing methods for both statistical power and the capability of identifying the exact MEGS, particularly for highly imbalanced MEGS. Our method can be used for de novo discovery, pathway-guided searches or for expanding established small MEGS. We applied our method to the whole exome sequencing data for fourteen cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified multiple previously unreported non-pairwise MEGS in multiple cancer types. For acute myeloid leukemia, we identified a novel MEGS with five genes (FLT3, IDH2, NRAS, KIT and TP53) and a MEGS (NPM1, TP53 and RUX1)s whose mutation status was strongly associated with survival (P=6.7x10-4). For breast cancer, we identified a significant MEGS consisting of TP53 and four infrequently mutated genes (ARID1A, AKT1, MED23 and TBL1XR1), providing support for their role as cancer drivers."
10.1101/017756,"We present a mechanism by which organisms with only a single photoreceptor, that have a monochromatic view of the world, can achieve color discrimination. The combination of an off-axis pupil and the principle of chromatic aberration (where light of different colors focus at different distances behind a lens) can combine to provide \""color-blind\"" animals with a way to distinguish colors. As a specific example we constructed a computer model of the visual system of cephalopods, (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) that have a single unfiltered photoreceptor type. Nevertheless, cephalopods dramatically change color both to produce chromatically-matched camouflage and to signal conspecifics. This presents a paradox - an apparent ability to determine color in organisms with a monochromatic visual system - that has been a long-standing puzzle. We demonstrate that chromatic blurring dominates the visual acuity in these animals, and we quantitatively show how chromatic aberration can be exploited, especially through non-axial pupils that are characteristic of cephalopods, to obtain spectral information. This mechanism is consistent with the extensive suite of visual/behavioral and physiological data that have been obtained from cephalopod studies, and resolves the apparent paradox of vivid chromatic behaviors in \""color-blind\"" animals. Moreover, this proposed mechanism has potential applicability in any organisms with limited photoreceptor complements, such as spiders and dolphins."
10.1101/017749,"The selfing syndrome constitutes a suite of floral and reproductive trait changes that have evolved repeatedly across many evolutionary lineages in response to the shift to selfing. Convergent evolution of the selfing syndrome suggests that these changes are adaptive, yet our understanding of the detailed molecular genetic basis of the selfing syndrome remains limited. Here, we investigate the role of cis-regulatory changes during the recent evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella rubella, which split from the outcrosser Capsella grandiflora less than 200 kya. We assess allele-specific expression (ASE) in leaves and flower buds at a total of 18,452 genes in three interspecific F1 C. grandiflora x C. rubella hybrids. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that accounts for technical variation using genomic reads, we find evidence for extensive cis-regulatory changes. On average, 44% of the assayed genes show evidence of ASE, however only 6% show strong allelic expression biases. Flower buds, but not leaves, show an enrichment of cis-regulatory changes in genomic regions responsible for floral and reproductive trait divergence between C. rubella and C. grandiflora. We further detected an excess of heterozygous transposable element (TE) insertions near genes with ASE, and TE insertions targeted by uniquely mapping 24-nt small RNAs were associated with reduced expression of nearby genes. Our results suggest that cis-regulatory changes have been important during the recent adaptive floral evolution in Capsella and that differences in TE dynamics between selfing and outcrossing species could be important for rapid regulatory divergence in association with mating system shifts."
10.1101/017772,"There is increasing evidence that non-annotated short open reading frames (sORFs) can encode functional micropeptides, but computational identification remains challenging. We expand our published method and predict conserved sORFs in human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly and the nematode C. elegans. Isolating specific conservation signatures indicative of purifying selection on encoded amino acid sequence, we identify about 2000 novel sORFs in the untranslated regions of canonical mRNAs or on transcripts annotated as non-coding. Predicted sORFs show stronger conservation signatures than those identified in previous studies and are sometimes conserved over large evolutionary distances. Encoded peptides have little homology to known proteins and are enriched in disordered regions and short interaction motifs. Published ribosome profiling data indicate translation for more than 100 of novel sORFs, and mass spectrometry data gives peptidomic evidence for more than 70 novel candidates. We thus provide a catalog of conserved micropeptides for functional validation in vivo."
10.1101/017806,"Projections from the substantia nigra and striatum traverse through the pallidum on the way to their targets. To date, in vivo characterization of these pathways remains elusive. Here we used high angular resolution diffusion imaging (N=138) to study the characteristics and structural subcompartments of the human pallidum. Our results show that the diffusion orientation distribution at the pallidum is asymmetrically oriented in a dorsolateral direction, consistent with the orientation of underlying fiber systems. Furthermore, compared to the outer pallidal segment, the internal segment has more peaks in the orientation distribution function and stronger anisotropy in the primary fiber direction, consistent with known cellular differences between the underlying nuclei. These differences in orientation, complexity, and degree of anisotropy are sufficiently robust to automatically segment the pallidal nuclei using diffusion properties. Thus the gray matter diffusion signal can be useful as an in vivo measure of the collective nigrostriatal and striatonigral pathways."

10.1101/017913,"Behavioral and sensory adaptations are often based in the differential expansion of brain components. These volumetric differences represent changes in investment, processing capacity and/or connectivity, and can be used to investigate functional and evolutionary relationships between different brain regions, and between brain composition and behavioral ecology. Here, we describe the brain composition of two species of Heliconius butterflies, a long-standing study system for investigating ecological adaptation and speciation. We confirm a previous report of striking mushroom body expansion, and explore patterns of post-eclosion growth and experience-dependent plasticity in neural development. This analysis uncovers age-and experience-dependent post-emergence mushroom body growth comparable to that in foraging hymenoptera, but also identifies plasticity in several other neuropil. An interspecific analysis indicates that Heliconius display remarkable levels of investment in mushroom bodies for a lepidopteran, and indeed rank highly compared to other insects. Our analyses lay the foundation for future comparative and experimental analyses that will establish Heliconius as a useful case study in evolutionary neurobiology."
10.1101/017871,"Methods for detecting the genomic signatures of natural selection have been heavily studied, and they have been successful in identifying many selective sweeps. For most of these sweeps, the favored allele remains unknown, making it difficult to distinguish carriers of the sweep from non-carriers. In an ongoing selective sweep, carriers of the favored allele are likely to contain a future most recent common ancestor. Therefore, identifying them may prove useful in predicting the evolutionary trajectory -- for example, in contexts involving drug-resistant pathogen strains or cancer subclones. The main contribution of this paper is the development and analysis of a new statistic, the Haplotype Allele Frequency (HAF) score. The HAF score, assigned to individual haplotypes in a sample, naturally captures many of the properties shared by haplotypes carrying a favored allele. We provide a theoretical framework for computing expected HAF scores under different evolutionary scenarios, and we validate the theoretical predictions with simulations. As an application of HAF score computations, we develop an algorithm (PreCIOSS: Predicting Carriers of Ongoing Selective Sweeps) to identify carriers of the favored allele in selective sweeps, and we demonstrate its power on simulations of both hard and soft sweeps, as well as on data from well-known sweeps in human populations.\n\nAuthor summaryMethods for detecting the genomic signatures of natural selection have been heavily studied, and they have been successful in identifying genomic regions under positive selection. However, methods that detect positive selective sweeps do not typically identify the favored allele, or even the haplotypes carrying the favored allele. The main contribution of this paper is the development and analysis of a new statistic (the HAF score), assigned to individual haplotypes. Using both theoretical analyses and simulations, we describe how the HAF scores differ for carriers and non-carriers of the favored allele, and how they change dynamically during a selective sweep. We also develop an algorithm, PreCIOSS, for separating carriers and non-carriers. Our tool has broad applicability as carriers of the favored allele are likely to contain a future most recent common ancestor. Therefore, identifying them may prove useful in predicting the evolutionary trajectory -- for example, in contexts involving drug-resistant pathogen strains or cancer subclones."
10.1101/017848,"Diapause and aging are controlled by overlapping genetic mechanisms in C.elegans and these include microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we investigated miRNA regulation in embryos of annual killifish that naturally undergo diapause to overcome desiccation of their habitats. We compared miRNA expression in diapausing and non-diapausing embryos in three independent lineages of killifish. We identified 13 miRNAs with similar regulation in all three lineages. One of these is miR-430, which is known as key regulator of early embryonic development in fish. We further tested whether this regulation overlaps with the aging-dependent regulation of miRNAs in one annual species: Nothobranchius furzeri. We found that miR-101a and miR-18a are regulated in the same direction during diapause and aging. These results provide the first evidence that overlapping genetic networks control diapause and aging in vertebrates and suggest that diapause mimics aging to some extent."
10.1101/017855,"Organismal size depends on the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in humans have implied many genes in the control of height but suffer from the inability to control the environment. Genetic analyses in Drosophila have identified conserved signaling pathways controlling size; however, how these pathways control phenotypic diversity is unclear. We performed GWA of size traits using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel of inbred, sequenced lines. We find that the top associated variants differ between traits and sexes; do not map to canonical growth pathway genes, but can be linked to these by epistasis analysis; and are enriched for genes and putative enhancers. Performing GWA on well-studied developmental traits under controlled conditions expands our understanding of developmental processes underlying phenotypic diversity.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGenetic studies in Drosophila have elucidated conserved signaling pathways and environmental factors that together control organismal size. In humans, hundreds of genes are associated with height variation, but these associations have not been performed in a controlled environment. As a result we are still lacking an understanding of the mechanisms creating size variability within a species. Here, under carefully controlled environmental conditions, we identify naturally occurring genetic variants that are associated with size diversity in Drosophila. We identify a cluster of associations close to the kek1 locus, a well-characterized growth regulator, but otherwise find that most variants are located in or close to genes that do not belong to the conserved pathways but may interact with these in a biological network. Many of these genes have a conserved role in humans. We validate 33 novel growth regulatory genes that participate in diverse cellular processes, most notably cellular metabolism and cell polarity. This study is the first genome-wide association analysis of natural variants underlying size in Drosophila and our results complement the knowledge we have accumulated on this trait from mutational studies of single genes."
10.1101/017889,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse class of RNAs with increasingly appreciated functions in vertebrates, yet much of their biology remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear to what extent the current catalog of over 10,000 distinct annotated lncRNAs is indeed devoid of genes coding for proteins. Here we review the available computational and experimental schemes for distinguishing between coding and noncoding transcripts and assess the conclusions from their recent genome-wide applications. We conclude that the model most consistent with available data is that a large number of mammalian lncRNAs undergo translation, but only a very small minority of such translation events result in stable and functional peptides. The outcome of the majority of the translation events and their potential biological purposes remain an intriguing topic for future investigation."
10.1101/017863,"Adult zebrafish are robustly social animals whereas larva is not. We designed an assay to determine at what stage of development zebrafish begin to interact with and prefer other fish. One week old zebrafish do not show significant social preference whereas most 3 weeks old zebrafish strongly prefer to remain in a compartment where they can view conspecifics. However, for some individuals, the presence of conspecifics drives avoidance instead of attraction. Social preference is dependent on vision and requires viewing fish of a similar age/size. In addition, over the same 1-3 weeks period larval zebrafish increasingly tend to coordinate their movements, a simple form of social interaction. Finally, social preference and coupled interactions are differentially modified by an NMDAR antagonist and acute exposure to ethanol, both of which are known to alter social behavior in adult zebrafish."
10.1101/017947,"Conserved genetic programs often predate the homologous structures and phenotypes to which they give rise; eyes, for example, have evolved several dozen times, but their development seems to involve a common set of conserved genes. Recently, the concept of orthologous phenotypes (or phenologs) offered a quantitative way to describe this property. Phenologs are phenotypes or diseases from separate species who share an unexpectedly large set of their associated gene orthologs. It has been shown that the phenotype pairs which make up a phenolog are mutually predictive in terms of the genes involved. Recently, we demonstrated the ranking of gene-phenotype association predictions using multiple phenologs from an array of species. In this work, we demonstrate a computational method which provides a more targeted view of the conserved pathways which give rise to diseases. Our approach involves the generation of synthetic pseudophenotypes made up of Boolean combinations (union, intersection, and difference) of the gene sets for phenotypes from our database. We search for diseases that overlap significantly with these Boolean phenotypes, and find a number of highly predictive combinations. While set unions produce less specific predictions (as expected), intersection and difference-based combinations appear to offer insights into extremely specific aspects of target diseases. For example, breast cancer is predicted by zebrafish methylmercury response minus metal ion response, with predictions MT-COI, JUN, SOD2, GADD45B, and BAX all involved in the pro-apoptotic response to reactive oxygen species, thought to be a key player in cancer. We also demonstrate predictions from Arabidopsis Boolean phenotypes for increased brown adipose tissue in mouse (salt stress responses intersection with sucrose stimulus response); and for human myopathy (red light response minus water deprivation response). We demonstrate the ranking of predictions for human holoprosencephaly from the set intersections between each pair of a variety of closely-related zebrafish phenotypes. Our results suggest that Boolean phenolog combinations may provide a more informed insight into the conserved pathways underlying diseases than either regular phenologs or the naive Bayes approach."
10.1101/018028,"With massive amount of sequencing data generated for many epigenetic features in a variety of cell and tissue types, the chief challenges are to build effective and quantitative models explaining how the dynamics in multiple epigenomes lead to differential gene expression and diverse phenotypes. We developed a unified Bayesian framework for jointly annotating multiple epigenomes and detecting differential regulation among multiple tissues and cell types over regions of varying sizes. Our method, called IDEAS (integrative and discriminative epigenome annotation system), achieves superior power and accuracy over existing methods by modeling both position and cell type specific regulatory activities. Using 84 ENCODE epigenetic data sets in 6 cell types, we identified epigenetic variation of different sizes that are strongly associated with differential gene expression. The detected regions are significantly enriched in genetic variants associated with complex phenotypes. Our results yielded much stronger enrichment scores than achievable by existing approaches, and the enriched phenotypes are highly relevant to the corresponding cell types. IDEAS is a powerful statistical tool for integrative annotation of regulatory elements and detection of multivariate epigenetic variation in many tissues and cell types, which could be of important utility in elucidating the interplay between genetic variants, gene regulation and diseases.\n\nThe states generated by IDEAS can be visualized or downloaded from the \""Regulation\"" section of http://main.genome-browser.bx.psu.edu/"
10.1101/017954,"Dispersal, and the underlying movement behaviour, are processes of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are non-random and rely on information, such as the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard information use. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is informed and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta-)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement are informed and adjusted by the strength of inter-specific interactions. We found that predicting informed movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and inter-specific interaction strength. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking inter-specific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of information use for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.\n\nAuthor contributionsAll authors designed the study.

These animals are commonly misclassified as golden jackals (Canis aureus) and have never been included in any large-scale studies of canid diversity and biogeography, or in investigations of the early stages of dog domestication. Applying massive Restriction Site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, 110481 polymorphic sites across the genome of 7 individuals of African wolf were aligned and compared with other wolf-like canids (golden jackal, Holarctic grey wolf, Ethiopian wolf, side-striped jackal and domestic dog). Analyses of this extensive sequence dataset (ca. 8.5Mb) show conclusively that the African wolves represent a distinct taxon more closely related to the Holarctic grey wolf than to the golden jackal. Our results strongly indicate that the distribution of the golden jackal needs to be re-evaluated and point towards alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the rare and endemic Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis). Furthermore, the extension of the grey wolf phylogeny and distribution opens new possible scenarios for the timing and location of dog domestication."

We tested its accuracy in simulated biological signals with varying receptor sensitivity and varying levels of random noise, and presented initial proof-of-concept data from functional MRI (fMRI) studies in primate brain. However, the initial simulation testing used a simple iterative approach to estimate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) parameters, an approach that was computationally efficient but returned parameters only from a small, discrete set of values chosen a priori.\n\nHere we revisit the simulation testing using a Bayesian method to estimate the PKPD parameters. This improved accuracy compared to our previous method, and noise without intentional signal was never interpreted as signal. We also reanalyze the fMRI proof-of-concept data.

10.1101/018036,"The rapidly expanding body of available genomic and protein structural data provides a rich resource for understanding protein dynamics with biomolecular simulation. While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences--from a single sequence to an entire superfamily-- and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics--such as Markov state models (MSMs)--which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.\n\nEnsembler is free and open source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.

Our experimental approach controls for undesirable culturing effects, while minimizing culture numbers, increasing feasibility in the field. Our statistical approach accounts for known issues with model-selection by using a permutation test to calculate significance values and includes both fitting and power calculation methods.

Here, we estimate DUF1220 domain counts across 12 primate genomes using a nucleotide Hidden Markov Model. We then test a series of hypotheses designed to examine the potential evolutionary significance of DUF1220 copy number expansion. Our results suggest a robust association with brain size, and more specifically neocortex volume.

We conducted an unmatched case-control study to test if a TSH level above 2.1 mlU/L is associated with first trimester pregnancy loss in anti-TPO antibody negative women. We found relatively higher number of women in the case group (18) whose TSH level was above 2.1 mlU/L compared to 7 women in control group. When considered patients in Group I (TSH [&le;] 2.1 mlU/L), 45.74% had miscarriage while 54.26% did not have miscarriage within first trimester of pregnancy. Among the Group II patients (TSH > 2.1 mlU/L), 78% had miscarriage and 28% did not have miscarriage. Noticeably there is a larger proportion of miscarriage among the women with TSH level above 2.1 mlU/L. The association between TSH level and first trimester pregnancy loss was statistically significant (p=.0196). From the multivariate analysis, odds ratio for TSH level (OR 4.0, 95% CI: 1.44-11.16) indicates that odds of having miscarriage whose TSH level is above 2.1 mlU/L is 4 times compared to those with TSH level below 2.1 mlU/L after adjusting for the effects of age and BMI. At a global level, the findings of this study provide evidence to the existing discussion on redefining the upper limit of TSH level that is related to first trimester pregnancy loss. At the local level, the results will have direct implication in facilitating management of future pregnancies particularly during the first trimester among Bangladeshi thyroid autoantibody negative women.

10.1101/018069,"Current biology is perplexed by the lack of a theoretical framework for understanding the organization principles of the molecular system within a cell. Here we first studied growth rate, one of the seemingly most complex cellular traits, using functional data of yeast single-gene deletion mutants. We observed nearly one thousand expression informative genes (EIGs) whose expression levels are linearly correlated to the trait within an unprecedentedly large functional space. A simple model considering six EIG-formed protein modules revealed a variety of novel mechanistic insights, and also explained [~]50% of the variance of cell growth rates measured by Bar-seq technique for over 400 yeast mutants (Pearsons R = 0.69), a performance comparable to the microarray-based (R = 0.77) or colony-size-based (R = 0.66) experimental approach. We then applied the same strategy to 501 morphological traits of the yeast and achieved successes in most fitness-coupled traits each with hundreds of trait-specific EIGs. Surprisingly, there is no any EIG found for most fitness-uncoupled traits, indicating that they are controlled by super-complex epistases that allow no simple expression-trait correlation. Thus, EIGs are recruited exclusively by natural selection, which builds a rather simple functional architecture for fitness-coupled traits, and the endless complexity of a cell lies primarily in its fitness-uncoupled features."
10.1101/018010,"Recent advances in genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction paved the way to the use of quantitative modelings such as FBA. However, despite the great interest of these techniques to tackle quantitative features, microbial community modeling remains unclear. Whereas studies represent a microbial community with several compartments for each microbial strains and their common pool, others advocate for the use of a single compartment that combines all reactions. Here we show that both modelings lead to different optimal quantitative solutions. This study illustrates this difference by the use of the flux module technique, that describes, in a compact way, the optimal solution space as computed by FBA-like techniques. For application, this paper computes the flux modules of a hot spring microbial community (represented by Synechococcus spp., Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus spp.) and a microbial methagenic system (Desulvovibrio vulgaris and Methanococcus maripaludis) sulfate reducing bacteria), while emphasizing the quantitative changes that occurs when one assumes either the consortium as a \""single compartment\"" or a multiple compartment."
10.1101/018093,"Identifying functional regions in the human genome is a major goal in human genetics. Great efforts have been made to functionally annotate the human genome either through computational predictions, such as genomic conservation, or high-throughput experiments, such as the ENCODE project. These efforts have resulted in a rich collection of functional annotation data of diverse types that need to be jointly analyzed for integrated interpretation and annotation. Here we present GenoCanyon, a whole-genome annotation method that performs unsupervised statistical learning using 22 computational and experimental annotations thereby inferring the functional potential of each position in the human genome. With GenoCanyon, we are able to predict many of the known functional regions. The ability of predicting functional regions as well as its generalizable statistical framework makes GenoCanyon a unique and powerful tool for whole-genome annotation.

10.1101/018101,"Most methods for performing a phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments of gene data assume that the mechanism of evolution is constant through time. It is recognised that some sites do evolve somewhat faster than others, and this can be captured using a (gamma) rate heterogeneity model. Further, some species have shorter replication times than others, and this results in faster rates of substitution in some lineages. This feature of lineage specific rate variation can be captured to some extent, by using relaxed clock models. However, it is also clear that there are additional poorly characterised features of sequence data that can sometimes lead to extreme differences in lineage specific rates. This variation is poorly captured by constant time reversible substitution models. The significance of extreme lineage specific rate differences is that they lead both to errors in reconstructing evolutionary relationships as well as biased estimates for the age of ancestral nodes. We propose a new model that allows gamma rate heterogeneity to change on branches, thus offering a more realistic model of sequence evolution. It adds negligible computational cost to likelihood calculations. We illustrate its effectiveness with an example of green algae and land-plants. For many real world data sets, we find a much better fit with multi-gamma sites models as well as substantial differences in ancestral node date estimates."

10.1101/018127,"Water recreation, though increasing globally, is strongly associated with infectious diseases. Unexpectedly, artificial water recreation systems e.g. swimming pools account for 90% of these outbreaks. It is therefore essential that pool waters be regularly monitored for deviations from microbial water quality guidelines. To assess the sanitary quality of a club swimming pool in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, I used the multiple-tube fermentation technique to determine the most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria in 100 ml of pool water. MPN estimates ranged from 9 to 93 with geometric mean of 38. Escherichia coli was isolated from positive presumptive tubes, indicating recent faecal contamination. The isolate elicited similar biochemical reactions as reference E. coli (ATCC-25922), except that it utilized sucrose and liquefied gelatin, which probably indicates potential pathogenicity. Also, the E. coli isolate was resistant to 13 antibiotics from 9 different classes. Finally, coliform counts and detection of E. coli clearly violates international guidelines. I recommend that pool operators increase water disinfection efficiency and educate the public on the need for improved swimmer hygiene to reduce the risk of recreational water illness transmission.\n\nConflicts of InterestThe author declares no conflict of interest."
10.1101/018168,"The use of genomic data in the clinic has not been as widespread as was envisioned when sequencing and genomic analysis became common techniques. An underlying difficulty is the direct assessment of how much additional information genomic data are providing beyond standard clinical measurements. This is hard to quantify in the clinical setting where laboratory tests based on genomic signatures are fairly new and there are not sufficient data collected to determine how valuable these tests have been in practice. Here we focus on the potential precision gain from using the popular MammaPrint genomic signature in a covariate-adjusted, randomized clinical trial. We describe how adjustment of an estimator for the average treatment effect using baseline measurements can improve precision. This precision gain can be translated directly into sample size reduction and corresponding cost savings. We conduct a simulation study using genomic and clinical data gathered for breast cancer patients and find that adjusting for clinical factors alone provides a gain in precision of 5-6%, adjusting for genomic factors alone provides a similar gain (5%), and combining the two yields a 2-3% additional gain over only adjusting for clinical covariates."
10.1101/018176,"For efficient background matching it is essential that animals closely match a set of salient visual statistics of their visual surroundings. The mean intensity of a background is a key statistic, because it can be estimated across a large range of viewing distances by a simple computation. We investigated how the dynamic neuromuscular camouflage system of the cuttlefish Sepia offcinalis responds to changes in the mean background intensity of uniform backgrounds. We find that cuttlefish adapt their body intensity in response to variations in the mean background intensity, yet show biases in their body intensity beyond what can be predicted from the limited dynamic range of their camouflage system. On sandy backgrounds of various reflectance values their uniform body patterns maintain a constant yellow hue. This color constancy may represent an example of a color prior in a colorblind animal because a yellow body color would be the optimal hue for camouflage on sands typically encountered in their natural environment. Cuttlefish adapt their appearance to the background via a dynamic process composed of a complex mixture of intensity transients spanning timescales from the subsecond to the minute range. In very young animals camouflaging on dark sands the masquerade strategy is preferred over background matching. Masquerade is implemented by combining partial background matching with frequent expression of disruptive components. We furthermore provide an objective definition of disruptive components using hierarchical clustering and automated image analysis thus highlighting the role of chromatophore activity correlations in structuring the motor output of S.officinalis."
10.1101/018143,"Searching for genetic variants with unusual differentiation between subpopulations is an established approach for identifying signals of natural selection. However, existing methods generally require discrete subpopulations. We introduce a method that infers selection using principal components (PCs) by identifying variants whose differentiation along top PCs is significantly greater than the null distribution of genetic drift. To enable the application of this method to large data sets, we developed the FastPCA software, which employs recent advances in random matrix theory to accurately approximate top PCs while reducing time and memory cost from quadratic to linear in the number of individuals, a computational improvement of many orders of magnitude. We apply FastPCA to a cohort of 54,734 European Americans, identifying 5 distinct subpopulations spanning the top 4 PCs. Using the PC-based test for natural selection, we replicate previously known selected loci and identify three new genome-wide significant signals of selection, including selection in Europeans at the ADH1B gene. The coding variant rs1229984*T has previously been associated to a decreased risk of alcoholism and shown to be under selection in East Asians; we show that it is a rare example of independent evolution on two continents. We also detect new selection signals at IGFBP3 and IGH, which have also previously been associated to human disease."
10.1101/018184,"It is increasingly argued that cancer stem cells are not a cellular phenotype but rather a transient state that cells can acquire, either through intrinsic signaling cascades or in response to environmental cues. While cancer stem cell plasticity is generally associated with increased aggressiveness and treatment resistance, we set out to thoroughly investigate the impact of different rates of plasticity on early and late tumor growth dynamics and the response to therapy. We develop an agent-based model of cancer stem cell driven tumor growth, in which plasticity is defined as a spontaneous transition between stem and non-stem cancer cell states. Simulations of the model show that plasticity can substantially increase tumor growth rate and invasion. At high rates of plasticity, however, the cells get exhausted and the tumor will undergo spontaneous remission in the long term. In a series of in silico trials we show that such remission can be facilitated through radiotherapy. The presented study suggests that stem cell plasticity has rather complex, non-intuitive implications on tumor growth and treatment response. Further theoretical, experimental and integrated studies are needed to fully decipher cancer stem cell plasticity and how it can be harnessed for novel therapeutic approaches."

The goal here is to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in landscape genetic studies, the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within published landscape genetic papers examining the extent to which emergent questions are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing individual- and population-based approaches.

10.1101/018200,"benchmarkR is an R package designed to assess and visualize the performance of statistical methods for datasets that have an independent truth (e.g., simulations or datasets with large-scale validation), in particular for methods that claim to control false discovery rates (FDR). We augment some of the standard performance plots (e.g., receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves) with information about how well the methods are calibrated (i.e., whether they achieve their expected FDR control). For example, performance plots are extended with a point to highlight the power or FDR at a user-set threshold (e.g., at a method's estimated 5% FDR). The package contains general containers to store simulation results (SimResults) and methods to create graphical summaries, such as receiver operating characteristic curves (rocX), false discovery plots (fdX) and power-to-achieved FDR plots (powerFDR); each plot is augmented with some form of calibration information. We find these plots to be an improved way to interpret relative performance of statistical methods for genomic datasets where many hypothesis tests are performed. The strategies, however, are general and will find applications in other domains."
10.1101/018218,"Transposable elements (TEs) are major drivers of genomic and phenotypic evolution, yet many questions about their biology remain poorly understood. Here, we compare TE abundance between populations of the two sister species D. mauritiana und D. simulans and relate it to the more distantly related D. melanogaster. The low population frequency of most TE insertions in D. melanogaster and D. simulans has been a key feature of several models of TE evolution. In D. mauritiana, however, the majority of TE insertions are fixed (66%). We attribute this to a lower transposition activity of up to 47 TE families in D. mauritiana, rather than stronger purifying selection. Only three families, including the extensively studied Mariner, may have a higher activity in D. mauritiana. This remarkable difference in TE activity between two recently diverged Drosophila species ({approx} 250,000 years), also supports the hypothesis that TE copy numbers in Drosophila may not reflect a stable equilibrium where the rate of TE gains equals the rate of TE losses by negative selection. We propose that the transposition rate heterogeneity results from the contrasting ecology of the two species: the extent of vertical extinction of TE families and horizontal acquisition of active TE copies may be very different between the colonizing D. simulans and the island endemic D. mauritiana. Our findings provide novel insights in the evolution of TEs in Drosophila and suggest that the ecology of the host species could be a major, yet underappreciated, factor governing the evolutionary dynamics of TEs."

10.1101/018267,"Motivation: Personal genomes carry inherent privacy risks and protecting privacy poses major social and technological challenges. We consider the case where a user searches for genetic information (e.g., an allele) on a server that stores a large genomic database and aims to receive allele-associated information. The user would like to keep the query and result private and the server the database.\n\nApproach: We propose a novel approach that combines efficient string data structures such as the Burrows-Wheeler transform with cryptographic techniques based on additive homomorphic encryption. We assume that the sequence data is searchable in efficient iterative query operations over a large indexed dictionary, for instance, from large genome collections and employing the (positional) Burrows-Wheeler transform. We use a technique called oblivious transfer that is based on additive homomorphic encryption to conceal the sequence query and the genomic region of interest in positional queries.\n\nResults: We designed and implemented an efficient algorithm for searching sequences of SNPs in large genome databases. During search, the user can only identify the longest match while the server does not learn which sequence of SNPs the user queried. In an experiment based on 2,184 aligned haploid genomes from the 1,000 Genomes Project, our algorithm was able to perform typical queries within {approx}4.6 seconds and {approx}10.8 seconds for client and server side, respectively, on laptop computers.

10.1101/018325,"Understanding how DNA sequence variation is translated into variation for complex phenotypes has remained elusive, but is essential for predicting adaptive evolution, selecting agriculturally important animals and crops, and personalized medicine. Here, we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found that a substantial fraction of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable and organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts, which provide functional context for newly identified transcribed regions. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, the latter of which could often be explained by an epistatic model. Expression quantitative trait loci for the mean, but not the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. This comprehensive characterization of population scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation."

Speed improvements are achieved by operating directly on a compressed genotype index without decompression. GQTs data compression ratios increase favorably with cohort size and relative analysis performance improves in kind.

10.1101/018374,"Dominance hierarchies are group-level properties that emerge from the aggressions of individuals. Although individuals can gain critical benefits from their position in a hierarchy, we do not understand how real-world hierarchies form, or what signals and decision-rules individuals use to construct and maintain them in the absence of simple cues. A study of aggression in two groups of captive monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) found a transition to large-scale ordered aggression occurred in newly-formed groups after one week, with individuals thereafter preferring to direct aggression against those nearby in rank. We describe two mechanisms by which individuals may determine rank order: inference based on overall levels of aggression, or on subsets of the aggression network. Both pathways were predictive of individual decisions to aggress. Based on these results, we present a new theory, of a feedback loop between knowledge of rank and consequent behavior, that explains the transition to strategic aggression, and the formation and persistence of dominance hierarchies in groups capable of both social memory and social inference."
10.1101/018226,"AbstractAttention is commonly thought to improve behavioral performance by increasing response gain and suppressing shared variability in neuronal populations. However, both the focus and the strength of attention are likely to vary from one experimental trial to the next, thereby inducing response variability unknown to the experimenter. Here we study analytically how fluctuations in attentional state affect the structure of population responses in a simple model of spatial and feature attention. In our model, attention acts on the neural response exclusively by modulating each neurons gain. Neurons are conditionally independent given the stimulus and the attentional gain, and correlated activity arises only from trial-to-trial fluctuations of the attentional state, which are unknown to the experimenter. We find that this simple model can readily explain many aspects of neural response modulation under attention, such as increased response gain, reduced individual and shared variability, increased correlations with firing rates, limited range correlations, and differential correlations. We therefore suggest that attention may act primarily by increasing response gain of individual neurons without affecting their correlation structure. The experimentally observed reduction in correlations may instead result from reduced variability of the attentional gain when a stimulus is attended. Moreover, we show that attentional gain fluctuations - even if unknown to a downstream readout - do not impair the readout accuracy despite inducing limited-range correlations."
10.1101/018358,"RNA genetic circuitry is emerging as a powerful tool to control gene expression. However, little work has been done to create a theoretical foundation for RNA circuit design. A prerequisite to this is a quantitative modeling framework that accurately describes the dynamics of RNA circuits. In this work, we develop an ordinary differential equation model of transcriptional RNA genetic circuitry, using an RNA cascade as a test case. We show that parameter sensitivity analysis can be used to design a set of four simple experiments that can be performed in parallel using rapid cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) reactions to determine the thirteen parameters of the model. The resulting model accurately recapitulates the dynamic behavior of the cascade, and can be easily extended to predict the function of new cascade variants that utilize new elements with limited additional characterization experiments. Interestingly, we show that inconsistencies between model predictions and experiments led to the model-guided discovery of a previously unknown maturation step required for RNA regulator function. We also determine circuit parameters in two different batches of TX-TL, and show that batch-to-batch variation can be attributed to differences in parameters that are directly related to the concentrations of core gene expression machinery. We anticipate the RNA circuit models developed here will inform the creation of computer aided genetic circuit design tools that can incorporate the growing number of RNA regulators, and that the parameterization method will find use in determining functional parameters of a broad array of natural and synthetic regulatory systems.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/018358_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eace4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e2757org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8f454org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0cfc9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG"
10.1101/018317,"SUMMARYWhile complex dynamic biological networks control gene expression and metabolism in all living organisms, engineering comparable synthetic networks remains challenging1,2. Conducting extensive, quantitative and rapid characterization during the design and implementation process of synthetic networks is currently severely limited due to cumbersome molecular cloning and the difficulties associated with measuring parts, components and systems in cellular hosts. Engineering gene networks in a cell-free environment promises to be an efficient and effective approach to rapidly develop novel biological systems and understand their operating regimes3-5. However, it remains questionable whether complex synthetic networks behave similarly in cells and a cell-free environment, which is critical for in vitro approaches to be of significance to biological engineering. Here we show that synthetic dynamic networks can be readily implemented, characterized, and engineered in a cell-free framework and consequently transferred to cellular hosts. We implemented and characterized the \""repressilator\""6, a three-node negative feedback oscillator in vitro. We then used our cell-free framework to engineer novel three-node, four-node, and five-node negative feedback architectures going from the characterization of circuit components to the rapid analysis of complete networks. We validated our cell-free approach by transferring these novel three-node and five-node oscillators to Escherichia coli, resulting in robust and synchronized oscillations reflecting the in vitro observation. We demonstrate that comprehensive circuit engineering can be performed in a cell-free system and that the in vitro results have direct applicability in vivo. Cell-free synthetic biology thus has the potential to drastically speed up design-build-test cycles in biological engineering and enable the quantitative characterization of synthetic and natural networks."
10.1101/018424,"MicroRNAs are well-established players in the development of multicellular animals. Most of our understanding of microRNA function in arthropod development comes from studies in Drosophila. Despite their advantages as model systems, the long germband embryogenesis of fruit flies is an evolutionary derived state restricted to several holometabolous insect lineages. MicroRNA evolution and expression across development in animals exhibiting the ancestral and more widespread short germband mode of embryogenesis has not been characterized. We sequenced small RNA libraries of oocytes and successive time intervals covering the embryonic development of the short germband model organism, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We analysed the evolution and temporal expression of the microRNA complement, and sequenced libraries of total RNA to investigate the relationships with microRNA target expression. We show microRNA maternal loading and sequence-specific 3-end non-template oligoadenylation of maternally deposited microRNAs that is conserved between Tribolium and Drosophila. We further uncover large clusters encoding multiple paralogs from several Tribolium-specific microRNA families expressed during a narrow interval of time immediately after the activation of zygotic transcription. These novel microRNAs, together with several early expressed conserved microRNAs, target a significant number of maternally deposited transcripts. Comparison with Drosophila shows that microRNA-mediated maternal transcript targeting is a conserved phenomenon in insects, but the number and sequences of microRNAs involved in this process have diverged. The expression of fast-evolving and species-specific microRNAs in the early blastoderm of T. castaneum is consistent with previous findings in Drosophila and shows that the unique permissiveness for microRNA innovation at this stage is a conserved phenomenon."
10.1101/018416,"In recent years, different technologies have been used to measure genome-wide gene expression levels across many types of tissues and in response to in vitro treatments. However, a full understanding of gene regulation in any given cellular and environmental context combination is still missing. This is partly because analyzing tissue/environment-specific gene expression generally implies screening a large number of cellular conditions and samples, without prior knowledge of which conditions are most informative (e.g. some cell types may not respond to certain treatments). To circumvent these challenges, we have established a new two-step high-throughput and cost-effective RNA-seq approach: the first step consists of gene expression screening of a large number of conditions, while the second step focuses on deep sequencing of the most relevant conditions (e.g. largest number of differentially expressed genes). This study design allows for a fast and economical screen in step one, with a more profitable allocation of resources for the deep sequencing of re-pooled libraries in step two. We have applied this approach to study the response to 26 treatments in three lymphoblastoid cell lines and we show that it is applicable for other high-throughput transcriptome profiling requiring iterative refinement or screening."
10.1101/018408,"Neural circuits for behavior transform sensory inputs into motor outputs in patterns with strategic value. Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. Here, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for Drosophila larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of Channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons, and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear-nonlinear (LN) models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically-induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision-making."
10.1101/018432,"A method of sequencing peptides using tandem cells (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 167-171; RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 30694-30700) and peptidases is considered. A double tandem cell (two tandem cells in tandem) has three nanopores in series, an amino-acid-specific endopeptidase attached downstream of the first pore, and an exopeptidase attached downstream of the second pore. The endopeptidase cleaves a peptide threaded through the first pore into fragments that are well separated in time. Fragments pass through the second pore and are each cleaved by the exopeptidase into a series of single residues; the latter pass through the third pore and cause separate current blockades that can be counted. This leads to an ordered list of integers corresponding to the number of residues in each fragment. With 20 cells, one per amino acid type, and 20 peptide copies, the resulting 20 lists of integers are used by a simple algorithm to assemble the sequence. This is a quasi-digital process that uses the lengths of subsequences to sequence the peptide, it differs from conventional analog methods which seek to identify monomers in a polymer via differences in blockade levels, residence times, or transverse currents. Several implementation issues are discussed. In particular the problem of fast analyte translocation, widely considered intransigent, may be resolved through the use of a sufficiently long (40-60 nm) third pore. This translates to a required bandwidth of 1-2 MHz, which is within the range of currently available CMOS circuits."
10.1101/018515,"Aberrant DNA methylation has long been implicated in cancers. In this work we present a highly discriminative DNA methylation biomarker for non-small cell lung cancers and fourteen other cancers. Based on 69 NSCLC cell lines and 257 cancer-free lung tissues we identified a CpG island in SCT gene promoter which was verified by qMSP experiment in 15 NSCLC cell lines and 3 immortalized human respiratory epithelium cells. In addition, we found that SCT promoter was methylated in 23 cancer cell lines involving >10 cancer types profiled by ENCODE. We found that SCT promoter is hyper-methylated in primary tumors from TCGA lung cancer cohort. Additionally, we found that SCT promoter is methylated at high frequencies in fifteen malignancies and is not methylated in [~]1000 non-cancerous tissues across >30 organ types. Our study indicates that SCT promoter methylation is a highly discriminative biomarker for lung and many other cancers."
10.1101/018473,"This paper presents the Regime Shifts Database (RSDB), a new online, open-access database that uses a novel consistent framework to systematically analyze regime shifts based on their impacts, key drivers, underlying feedbacks, and management options. The database currently contains 27 generic types of regime shifts, and over 300 specific case studies of a variety of regime shifts. These regime shifts occur across diverse types of systems and are driven by many different types of processes. Besides impacting provisioning and regulating services, our work shows that regime shifts substantially impact cultural and aesthetic ecosystem services. We found that social-ecological feedbacks are difficult to characterize and more work is needed to develop new tools and approaches to better understand social-ecological regime shifts. We hope that the database will stimulate further research on regime shifts and make available information that can be used in management, planning and assessment."
10.1101/018457,"Evolution drives changes in a proteins sequence over time. The extent to which these changes in sequence lead to shifts in the underlying preference for each amino acid at each site is an important question with implications for comparative sequence-analysis methods such as molecular phylogenetics. To quantify the extent that site-specific amino-acid preferences shift during evolution, we performed deep mutational scanning on two homologs of human influenza nucleoprotein with 94% amino-acid identity. We found that only a modest fraction of sites exhibited shifts in amino-acid preferences that exceeded the noise in our experiments. Furthermore, even among sites that did exhibit detectable shifts, the magnitude tended to be small relative to differences between non-homologous proteins. Given the limited change in amino-acid preferences between these close homologs, we tested whether our measurements could inform site-specific substitution models that describe the evolution of nucleoproteins from more diverse influenza viruses. We found that site-specific evolutionary models informed by our experiments greatly outperformed non-site-specific alternatives in fitting phylogenies of nucleoproteins from human, swine, equine, and avian influenza. Combining the experimental data from both homologs improved phylogenetic fit, partly because measurements in multiple genetic contexts better captured the evolutionary average of the amino-acid preferences for sites with shifting preferences. Our results show that site-specific amino-acid preferences are sufficiently conserved that measuring mutational effects in one protein provides information that can improve quantitative evolutionary modeling of nearby homologs."
10.1101/018507,"Genetic interaction can be defined as a deviation of the phenotypic quantitative effect of a double gene mutation from the effect predicted from single mutations using a simple (e.g., multiplicative or linear additive) statistical model. Experimentally characterized genetic interaction networks in model organisms provide important insights into relationships between different biological functions. We describe a computational methodology allowing to systematically and quantitatively characterize a Boolean mathematical model of a biological network in terms of genetic interactions between all loss of function and gain of function mutations with respect to all model phenotypes or outputs. We use the probabilistic framework defined in MaBoSS software, based on continuous time Markov chains and stochastic simulations. In addition, we suggest several computational tools for studying the distribution of double mutants in the space of model phenotype probabilities. We demonstrate this methodology on three published models for each of which we derive the genetic interaction networks and analyze their properties. We classify the obtained interactions according to their class of epistasis, dependence on the chosen initial conditions and phenotype. The use of this methodology for validating mathematical models from experimental data and designing new experiments is discussed.{dagger}"
10.1101/018531,"Determining the methylation state of regions with high copy numbers is challenging for second-generation sequencing, because the read length is insufficient to map reads uniquely, especially when repetitive regions are long and nearly identical to each other. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions, because it is not vulnerable to GC bias, it performs long read lengths, and its kinetic information is sensitive to DNA modifications. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the kinetic information for neighboring CpG sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites. Both the sensitivity and precision of our algorithm were [~]93.7% on CpG site basis for the genome of an inbred medaka (Oryzias latipes) strain within a practical read coverage of [~]30-fold. The method is quantitatively accurate because we observed a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.884) between our method and bisulfite sequencing, and 92.0% of CpG sites were in concordance within 0.25. Using this method, we characterized the landscape of the methylation status of repetitive elements, such as LINEs, in the human genome, thereby revealing the strong correlation between CpG density and unmethylation and detecting unmethylation hot spots of LTRs and LINEs. We could uncover the methylation states for nearly identical active transposons, two novel LINE insertions of identity [~]99% and length 6050 base pairs (bp) in the human genome, and sixteen Tol2 elements of identity >99.8% and length 4682 bp in the medaka genome."
10.1101/018366,"Woolly mammoths and the living elephants are characterized by major phenotypic differences that allowed them to live in very different environments. To identify the genetic changes that underlie the suite of adaptations in woolly mammoths to life in extreme cold, we sequenced the nuclear genome from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths, identified and functionally annotated genetic changes unique to the woolly mammoth lineage. We find that genes with mammoth specific amino acid changes are enriched in functions related to circadian biology, skin and hair development and physiology, lipid metabolism, adipose development and physiology, and temperature sensation. Finally we resurrect and functionally test the mammoth and ancestral elephant TRPV3 gene, which encodes a temperature sensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channel involved in thermal sensation and hair growth, and show that a single mammoth-specific amino acid substitution in an otherwise highly conserved region of the TRPV3 channel strongly affected its temperature sensitivity. Our results have identified a set of genetic changes that likely played important roles in the adaptation of woolly mammoths to life in the high artic."
10.1101/018465,"Microbes are main drivers of biogeochemical cycles in oceans and lakes, yet surprisingly few bacterioplankton genomes have been sequenced, partly due to difficulties in cultivating them. Here we used automatic binning to reconstruct a large number of bacterioplankton genomes from a metagenomic time-series from the Baltic Sea. The genomes represent novel species within freshwater and marine clades, including clades not previously genome-sequenced. Their seasonal dynamics followed phylogenetic patterns, but with fine-grained lineage specific adaptations. Signs of streamlining were evident in most genomes, and estimated genome sizes correlated with abundance variation across filter size fractions. Comparing the genomes with globally distributed aquatic metagenomes suggested the existence of a global brackish metacommunity whose populations diverged from freshwater and marine relatives >100,000 years ago, hence long before the Baltic Sea was formed (8000 years). This markedly contrasts to most Baltic Sea multicellular organisms that are locally adapted populations of fresh- or marine counterparts."
10.1101/018499,"Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) show a dramatic form of socially induced phenotypic plasticity known as phase polyphenism. In the absence of conspecifics, locusts occur in a shy and cryptic solitarious phase. Crowding with conspecifics drives a behavioural transformation towards gregariousness that occurs within hours and is followed by changes in physiology, colouration and morphology, resulting in the full gregarious phase syndrome. We analysed methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphisms (MS-AFLP) to compare the effect of acute and chronic crowding on DNA methylation in the central nervous system. We find that crowd-reared and solitary-reared locusts show markedly different neural MS-AFLP fingerprints. However, crowding for a day resulted in neural MS-AFLP fingerprints that were clearly distinct from both crowd-reared and uncrowded solitary-reared locusts. Our results indicate that changes in DNA methylation associated with behavioural gregarisation proceed through intermediate states that are not simply partial realisations of the endpoint states."
10.1101/018580,"The chemically and physically induced pluripotency in a stem cell is studied from the point of quantum transition between differentiation and pluripotency states in genes. The quantum folding theory of a macromolecule is briefly reviewed. The relation of protein folding rate with the number N of torsion modes participating in the quantum transition (coherence degree) is discussed and a simple statistical relationship is obtained. As a unifying approach to conformational quantum transition the folding rate formula can be generalized from protein to nucleic acid. It is found that the formula of folding rate versus N well fits RNA folding data. Then the quantum folding theory is applied to study the pluripotency conversion in stem cell. We proved that the acquisition of pluripotency is essentially a quantum-stochastic event of small-probability through the comparison of the rate with protein folding. Due to the large coherence degree of DNA and the uphill nature of torsion transition the pluripotency-acquisition rate should be small. By establishing the reaction network of the conformational change of the pluripotency genes the characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape of the coherent domain of the gene is analyzed from the rate equation. Based on these studies an approach to the physically induced pluripotency with higher rate is proposed."
10.1101/018564,"Rapid and accurate detection of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is an urgent need, affecting both patient care and population-scale control. Microbial genome sequencing promises much, but many barriers exist to its routine deployment. Here, we address these challenges, using a de Bruijn graph comparison of clinical isolate and curated knowledge-base to identify species and predict resistance profile, including minor populations. This is implemented in a package, Mykrobe predictor, for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, running in under three minutes on a laptop from raw data. For S. aureus, we train and validate in 495/471 samples respectively, finding error rates comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.3%/99.5% across 12 drugs. For M. tuberculosis, we identify species and predict resistance with specificity of 98.5% (training/validating on 1920/1609 samples). Sensitivity of 82.6% is limited by current understanding of genetic mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of an emerging single-molecule sequencing technique."
10.1101/018572,"Elucidating the consequences of genetic differences between humans is essential for understanding phenotypic diversity and personalized medicine. Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA, translation, and protein levels suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy - many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation."
10.1101/018622,"Imaging cellular activities in an entire intact whole organ with light is a grand challenge in optical microscopy. To date, most passive clearing techniques were shown to transform brain, neuronal and embryo tissue into near transparent state for deep tissue imaging. Here, we expand these passive clearing protocols from neuronal tissue (brain and spinal cord) to other visceral organs such as liver and colon and further evaluate their \""depth-clearing performance\"" based on image contrast of endogenous fluorescence structures. We found that SeeDB achieves the highest depth in brain, 3DISCO is adept at clearing liver and spinal cord and ScaleViewA2 in colon. Overall, 3DISCO clears more rapidly than other agents but at a higher cost, while ScaleViewA2 is the most economical however at a slower rate. This study, for the first time, provide a direct evaluation of imaging depth, cost and time amongst passive tissue clearing protocols for different intact organs. In addition, we discuss the possible roles of tissue composition in clearing."
10.1101/018549,"Many ecosystems can experience regime shifts: surprising, large and persistent changes in the function and structure of ecosystems. Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers."
10.1101/018481,"Macroscopic descriptions of populations commonly assume that encounters between individuals are well mixed; i.e., each individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with any other individual. Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time series data from Pakistan and compared maximum-likelihood estimates of \""mixing parameters\"" when disaggregating data across an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other control efforts. We complement this analysis with relevant contemporary environmental drivers of dengue."
10.1101/018606,"The evolution of qualitatively new functions is fundamental for shaping the diversity of life. Such innovations are rare because they require multiple coordinated changes. We sought to understand the evolutionary processes involved in a particular key innovation, whereby phage {lambda} evolved the ability to exploit a novel receptor, OmpF, on the surface of Escherichia coli cells. Previous work has shown that this transition repeatedly evolves in the laboratory, despite requiring four mutations in specific regions of a single gene. Here we examine how this innovation evolved by studying six intermediate genotypes that arose during independent transitions to use OmpF. In particular, we tested whether these genotypes were favored by selection, and how a coevolved change in the hosts influenced the fitness of the phage genotypes. To do so, we measured the fitness of the intermediate types relative to the ancestral {lambda} when competing for either ancestral or coevolved host cells. All six intermediates had improved fitness on at least one host, and four had higher fitness on the coevolved host than on the ancestral host. These results show that the evolution of the phages new ability to use OmpF was repeatable because the intermediate genotypes were adaptive and, in many cases, because coevolution of the host favored their emergence."
10.1101/018648,"The role of rare missense variants in disease causation remains difficult to interpret. We explore whether the clustering pattern of rare missense variants (MAF<0.01) in a protein is associated with mode of inheritance. Mutations in genes associated with autosomal dominant (AD) conditions are known to result in either loss or gain of function, whereas mutations in genes associated with autosomal recessive (AR) conditions invariably result in loss of function. Loss-of-function mutations tend to be distributed uniformly along protein sequence, while gain-of-function mutations tend to localize to key regions. It has not previously been ascertained whether these patterns hold in general for rare missense mutations. We consider the extent to which rare missense variants are located within annotated protein domains and whether they form clusters, using a new unbiased method called CLUstering by Mutation Position (CLUMP). These approaches quantified a significant difference in clustering between AD and AR diseases. Proteins linked to AD diseases exhibited more clustering of rare missense mutations than those linked to AR diseases (Wilcoxon P=5.7x10-4, permutation P=8.4x10-4). Rare missense mutation in proteins linked to either AD or AR diseases were more clustered than controls (1000G) (Wilcoxon P=2.8x10-15 for AD and P=4.5x10-4 for AR, permutation P=3.1x10-12 for AD and P=0.03 for AR). Differences in clustering patterns persisted even after removal of the most prominent genes. Testing for such non-random patterns may reveal novel aspects of disease etiology in large sample studies."
10.1101/018655,"Integrative analyses of high-throughput omics data have elucidated the aetiology and pathogenesis for complex traits and diseases1-4, and the linking of omics information to electronic health records promises new insights into human health and disease. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy biomarker profiling has implicated glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk5 and all-cause mortality6. To elucidate biological processes contributing to GlycA-associated mortality risk, we leveraged human omics data from three population-based cohorts together with nation-wide Finnish hospital and mortality records. Elevated GlycA was associated with myriad infection-related inflammatory processes. Within individuals, elevated GlycA levels were stable over long time periods, up to a decade, and chronically elevated GlycA was also associated with modest elevation of numerous cytokines. Individuals with elevated GlycA also showed increased expression of a transcriptional sub-network, the Neutrophil Degranulation Module (NDM), suggesting an increased activity of microbe-driven immune response. Subsequent analysis of nation-wide hospitalisation and death records was consistent with a microbial basis for GlycA-associated mortality, with each standard deviation increase in GlycA raising an individuals future risk of hospitalization and death from non-localized infection by 40% and 136%, respectively. These results show that, beyond its established role in acute-phase response7-9, elevated GlycA is more broadly a biomarker for low-grade chronic inflammation and increased neutrophil activity. Further, increased risk of susceptibility to severe microbial-infection events in healthy individuals suggests this inflammation is a contributor to mortality risk. Taken together, this study demonstrates the power of an integrative approach that combines omics data and health records to delineate the biological processes underlying a newly discovered biomarker, providing a model strategy for future systems medicine studies."
10.1101/018713,"Genetic architecture is a general terminology used and discussed very often in complex traits genetics. It is related to the number of functional loci involved in explaining variation of a complex trait and the distribution of genetic effects across these loci. Understanding the complexity level of the genetic architecture of complex traits is essential for evaluating the potential power of mapping functional loci and prediction of complex traits. However, there has been no quantitative measurement of the genetic architecture complexity, which makes it difficult to link results from genetic data analysis to such terminology. Inspired by the \""Gini index\"" for measuring income distribution in economics, I develop a genetic architecture score (\""GA score\"") to measure genetic architecture complexity. Simulations indicate that the GA score is an effective measurement of the complexity level of complex traits genetic architecture."
10.1101/018739,"We review existing methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data and place them in a common framework of a sequence of tasks that are usually part of the process. We show that many existing methods produce large numbers of false positives in cases where the null hypothesis is true by construction and where actual data from RNA-Seq studies are used, as opposed to simulations that make specific assumptions about the nature of the data. We show that some of those mathematical assumptions about the data likely are one of the causes of the false positives, and define a general structure that is not apparently subject to these problems. The best performance was shown by limma-voom and by some simple methods composed of easily understandable steps."
10.1101/018721,"Artificial selection has, for decades, provided a powerful approach to study the genetics of adaptation. Using selective-sweep mapping, it is possible to identify genomic regions in populations where the allele-frequencies have diverged during selection. To avoid misleading signatures of selection, it is necessary to show that a sweep has an effect on the selected trait before it can be considered adaptive. Here, we confirm candidate selective-sweeps on a genome-wide scale in one of the longest, on-going bi-directional selection experiments in vertebrates, the Virginia high and low body-weight selected chicken lines. The candidate selective-sweeps represent standing genetic variants originating from the common base-population. Using a deep-intercross between the selected lines, 16 of 99 evaluated regions were confirmed to contain adaptive selective-sweeps based on their association with the selected trait, 56-day body-weight. Although individual additive effects were small, the fixation for alternative alleles in the high and low body-weight lines across these loci contributed at least 40% of the divergence between them and about half of the additive genetic variance present within and between the lines after 40 generations of selection. The genetic variance contributed by the sweeps corresponds to about 85% of the additive genetic variance of the base-population, illustrating that these loci were major contributors to the realised selection-response. Thus, the gradual, continued, long-term selection response in the Virginia lines was likely due to a considerable standing genetic variation in a highly polygenic genetic architecture in the base-population with contributions from a steady release of selectable genetic variation from new mutations and epistasis throughout the course of selection."
10.1101/018788,"When cellular traits are measured using high-throughput DNA sequencing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) manifest at two levels: population level differences between individuals and allelic differences between cis-haplotypes within individuals. We present RASQUAL (Robust Allele Specific QUAntitation and quality controL), a novel statistical approach for association mapping that integrates genetic effects and robust modelling of biases in next generation sequencing (NGS) data within a single, probabilistic framework. RASQUAL substantially improves causal variant localisation and sensitivity of association detection over existing methods in RNA-seq, DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximise association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,706 independent caQTLs (FDR 10%) and illustrate how RASQUALs improved causal variant localisation provides powerful information for fine-mapping disease-associated variants. We also map \""multipeak\"" caQTLs, identical genetic associations found across multiple, independent open chromatin regions and illustrate how genetic signals in ATAC-seq data can be used to link distal regulatory elements with gene promoters. Our results highlight how joint modelling of population and allele-specific genetic signals can improve functional interpretation of noncoding variation."
10.1101/018705,"Genome-wide expression profiling is a cost-efficient and widely used method to characterize heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such datasets typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit the significant amount of knowledge that exists about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an unsupervised method that incorporates prior knowledge about gene functions in the form of gene ontology (GO) annotations. GO-PCA aims to discover and represent biological heterogeneity along all major axes of variation in a given dataset, while suppressing heterogeneity due to technical biases. To this end, GO-PCA combines principal component analysis (PCA) with nonparametric GO enrichment analysis, and uses the results to generate expression signatures based on small sets of functionally related genes. I first applied GO-PCA to expression data from diverse lineages of the human hematopoietic system, and obtained a small set of signatures that captured known cell characteristics for most lineages. I then applied the method to expression profiles of glioblastoma (GBM) tumor biopsies, and obtained signatures that were strongly associated with multiple previously described GBM subtypes. Surprisingly, GO-PCA discovered a cell cycle-related signature that exhibited significant differences between the Proneural and the prognostically favorable GBM CpG Island Methylator (G-CIMP) subtypes, suggesting that the G-CIMP subtype is characterized in part by lower mitotic activity. Previous expression-based classifications have failed to separate these subtypes, demonstrating that GO-PCA can detect heterogeneity that is missed by other methods. My results show that GO-PCA is a powerful and versatile expression-based method that facilitates exploration of large-scale expression data, without requiring additional types of experimental data. The low-dimensional representation generated by GO-PCA lends itself to interpretation, hypothesis generation, and further analysis."
10.1101/018820,"Many evolutionary processes result in sufficiently low mean fitness that they pose a risk of species extinction. Sex-ratio meiotic drive was recognized by W.D. Hamilton (1967) to pose such a risk, because as the driving sex chromosome becomes common, the opposite sex becomes rare. We expand on Hamiltons classic model by allowing for the escape from extinction due to evolution of suppressors of X and Y drivers. We explore differences in the two systems in their probability of escape from extinction. Several novel conclusions are evident, including a) that extinction time scales approximately with the log of population size so that even large populations may go extinct quickly, b) extinction risk is driven by the relationship between female fecundity and drive strength, c) anisogamy and the fact that X and Y drive result in sex ratios skewed in opposite directions, mean systems with Y drive are much more likely to go extinct than those with X drive, and d) suppressors are most likely to become established when the strength of drive is intermediate, since weak drive leads to weak selection for suppression and strong drive leads to rapid extinction."
10.1101/018796,"Studying the evolution of climatic niches through time in a phylogenetic comparative framework combines species distribution modeling with phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative studies aid the understanding of the evolution of species environmental preferences by revealing the underlying evolutionary processes and causes, detecting the differences among groups of species or relative to evolutionary pattern of other phenotypic traits, but also act as a yardstick to gauge the adaptational potential under climate change. Because several alternatives exist on how to compute and represent the climatic niche, we here review and discuss the current state of the art and propose a best practice to use in comparative studies. Moreover we outline the common evolutionary models and available model-fitting methods and describe the procedure for ancestral niche reconstruction with the intention to give a broad overview and highlight the most advanced approaches for optimal niche-related comparative studies."
10.1101/018697,"A composite likelihood ratio test implemented in the program SweepFinder is a commonly used method for scanning a genome for recent selective sweeps. SweepFinder uses information on the spatial pattern of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) around the selected locus. To avoid confounding effects of background selection and variation in the mutation process along the genome, the method is typically applied only to sites that are variable within species. However, the power to detect and localize selective sweeps can be greatly improved if invariable sites are also included in the analysis. In the spirit of a Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade test, we suggest to add fixed differences relative to an outgroup to account for variation in mutation rate, thereby facilitating more robust and powerful analyses. We also develop a method for including background selection modeled as a local reduction in the effective population size. Using simulations we show that these advances lead to a gain in power while maintaining robustness to mutation rate variation. Furthermore, the new method also provides more precise localization of the causative mutation than methods using the spatial pattern of segregating sites alone."
10.1101/018770,"Although Siberia was inhabited by modern humans at an early stage, there is still debate over whether this area remained habitable during the extremely cold period of the Last Glacial Maximum or whether it was subsequently repopulated by peoples with a recent shared ancestry. Previous studies of the genetic history of Siberian populations were hampered by the extensive admixture that appears to have taken place among these populations, since commonly used methods assume a tree-like population history and at most single admixture events. We therefore developed a new method based on the covariance of ancestry components, which we validated with simulated data, in order to investigate this potentially complex admixture history and to distinguish the effects of shared ancestry from prehistoric migrations and contact. We furthermore adapted a previously devised method of admixture dating for use with multiple events of gene flow, and applied these methods to whole-genome genotype data from over 500 individuals belonging to 20 different Siberian ethnolinguistic groups. The results of these analyses indicate that there have indeed been multiple layers of admixture detectable in most of the Siberian populations, with considerable differences in the admixture histories of individual populations, and with the earliest events dated to not more than 4500 years ago. Furthermore, most of the populations of Siberia included here, even those settled far to the north, can be shown to have a southern origin. These results provide support for a recent population replacement in this region, with the northward expansions of different populations possibly being driven partly by the advent of pastoralism, especially reindeer domestication. These newly developed methods to analyse multiple admixture events should aid in the investigation of similarly complex population histories elsewhere.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe developed a new method that lets us disentangle complex admixture events and date the individual episodes of gene flow. We applied this method to a large dataset of genome-wide SNP genotypes from a linguistically diverse sample of populations covering the extent of Siberia. Our results demonstrate that these populations have been in intense contact with each other, with most of them carrying more than two, and up to six different ancestries. Nevertheless, as shown by the dates we estimate, these various admixture events have taken place over a relatively short time, with the oldest dating to not more than 4500 years ago. Our results emphasize the enormous impact that contact has had on the genetic history of these Siberian populations, and the methods developed here will be of use in the investigation of admixture events in populations around the world."
10.1101/018762,"Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), a promising technology for exploring ribosome decoding rates, is characterized by the presence of infrequent high peaks in ribosome footprint density and by long alignment gaps. Here, to reduce the impact of the data heterogeneity we introduce a simple normalization method, Ribo-seq Unit Step Transformation (RUST). RUST is robust and outperforms other normalization techniques in the presence of heterogeneous noise. We illustrate how RUST can be used for identifying mRNA sequence features that affect ribosome footprint densities globally. We show that a few parameters extracted with RUST are sufficient for predicting experimental densities with high accuracy. Importantly the application of RUST to 30 publicly available Ribo-seq datasets revealed a substantial variation in sequence determinants of ribosome footprint frequencies, questioning the reliability of Ribo-seq as an accurate representation of local ribosome densities without prior quality control. This emphasizes our incomplete understanding of how protocol parameters affect ribosome footprint densities."
10.1101/018754,"The ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila contains two types of structurally and functionally differentiated nuclei: the transcriptionally active somatic macronucleus (MAC) and the transcriptionally silent germ-line micronucleus (MIC). Here we demonstrate that MAC features well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of transcription start sites (TSS) likely connected with promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II, as well as in exonic regions flanking both the 5 and 3 splice sites. In contrast, nucleosomes in MIC are more delocalized. Nucleosome occupancy in MAC and MIC are nonetheless highly correlated with each other and with predictions based upon DNA sequence features. Arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes are often correlated with GC content oscillations, suggesting significant contributions from cis-determinants. We propose that cis- and trans-determinants may coordinately accommodate some well-positioned nucleosomes with important functions, driven by a process in which positioned nucleosomes shape the mutational landscape of associated DNA sequences, while the DNA sequences in turn reinforce nucleosome positioning."

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) currently determine eligibility for trastuzumab-based therapy. However, both assays are low throughput with various limitations.\n\nMethodsWe developed a selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometric (SRM-MS) assay and quantified levels (amol/ug) of Her2-SRM in cell lines (n=27) and GEC tissues (n=139). We compared Her2-SRM expression with IHC/FISH, seeking to determine optimal SRM expression cut-offs to identify HER2 amplification.\n\nResultsAfter demonstrating assay development, precision, and stability, Her2-SRM measurement was observed to be highly concordant with HER2/CEP17 ratio, particularly in a multivariate regression model adjusted for SRM-expression of Met, Egfr, Her3, and HER2-heterogeneity covariates, and their interactions (cell lines r2=0.9842; FFPE r2=0.7643). In GEC tissues, Her2-SRM was detected in 71.2% of cases, and 12.3% were identified as  HER2+. ROC curves demonstrated HER2-SRM levels to have high specificity (100%) at an upper-level cut-off of >750 amol/g and sensitivity (75%) at lower-level cut-off of <450 amol/ug. We observed an  equivocal-zone between 450-750 amol/ug, analogous to  IHC2+, but less frequent (9-16% of cases versus 36-41%).\n\nSignificanceCompared to IHC, SRM-MS provided more objective and quantitative Her2 expression with excellent HER2/CEP17 FISH correlation and fewer  equivocal cases. Along with the multiplex capability for other relevant oncoproteins, these results demonstrated a refined HER2 expression assay for clinical application."
10.1101/018846,"Free iron is highly toxic and the blood-derived iron initiates early motor-neuron degeneration upon breakdown of blood-spinal cord barrier. Iron is currently known to trigger oxidative stress by Fenton chemistry but no report implies that iron manifests its toxicity through CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), the central antioxidant enzyme in all human tissues that carries >180 ALS-causing mutations. Here, by NMR we show that Zn2+ play an irreplaceable role in the maturation of the nascent hSOD1, and further decipher for the first time that out of 11 other cations only Fe2+ has the Zn2+-like capacity to induce folding to form the Fe2+-bound hSOD1. This acts to reduce or even block the maturation of wild-type and ALS-causing mutant hSOD1, consequently trapping SOD1 in toxic forms and provoking oxidative stress. Our study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest cellular toxicity that contributes to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryOur study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest toxicity contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more."

10.1101/018853,"The abundance of phenotypic diversity among species can enrich our knowledge of development and genetics beyond the limits of variation that can be observed in model organisms. The Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB) is designed to enable exploration and discovery of phenotypic variation among species. Because phenotypes in the KB are annotated using standard ontologies, evolutionary phenotypes can be compared with phenotypes from genetic perturbations in model organisms. To illustrate the power of this approach, we review the use of the KB to find taxa showing evolutionary variation similar to that of a query gene. Matches are made between the full set of phenotypes described for a gene and an evolutionary profile, the latter of which is defined as the set of phenotypes that are variable among the daughters of any node on the taxonomic tree. Phenoscapes semantic similarity interface allows the user to assess the statistical significance of each match and flags matches that may only result from differences in annotation coverage between genetic and evolutionary studies. Tools such as this will help meet the challenge of relating the growing volume of genetic knowledge in model organisms to the diversity of phenotypes in nature. The Phenoscape KB is available at http://kb.phenoscape.org."
10.1101/018879,"Proteins must move between different conformations of their native ensemble to perform their functions. Crystal structures obtained from high-resolution X-ray diffraction data reflect this heterogeneity as a spatial and temporal conformational average. Although movement between natively populated alternative conformations can be critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms, it is challenging to identify these conformations within electron density maps. Alternative side chain conformations are generally well separated into distinct rotameric conformations, but alternative backbone conformations can overlap at several atomic positions. Our model building program qFit uses mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to evaluate an extremely large number of combinations of sidechain conformers and backbone fragments to locally explain the electron density. Here, we describe two major modeling enhancements to qFit: peptide flips and alternative glycine conformations. We find that peptide flips fall into four stereotypical clusters and are enriched in glycine residues at the n+1 position. The potential for insights uncovered by new peptide flips and glycine conformations is exemplified by HIV protease, where different inhibitors are associated with peptide flips in the \""flap\"" regions adjacent to the inhibitor binding site. Our results paint a picture of peptide flips as conformational switches, often enabled by glycine flexibility, that result in dramatic local rearrangements. Our results furthermore demonstrate the power of large-scale computational analysis to provide new insights into conformational heterogeneity. Overall, improved modeling of backbone heterogeneity with high-resolution X-ray data will connect dynamics to the structure-function relationship and help drive new design strategies for inhibitors of biomedically important systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryDescribing the multiple conformations of proteins is important for understanding the relationship between molecular flexibility and function. However, most methods for interpreting data from X-ray crystallography focus on building a single structure of the protein, which limits the potential for biological insights. Here we introduce an improved algorithm for using crystallographic data to model these multiple conformations that addresses two previously overlooked types of protein backbone flexibility: peptide flips and glycine movements. The method successfully models known examples of these types of multiple conformations, and also identifies new cases that were previously unrecognized but are well supported by the experimental data. For example, we discover glycine-driven peptide flips in the inhibitor-gating \""flaps\"" of the drug target HIV protease that were not modeled in the original structures. Automatically modeling \""hidden\"" multiple conformations of proteins using our algorithm may help drive biomedically relevant insights in structural biology pertaining to, e.g., drug discovery for HIV-1 protease and other therapeutic targets."
10.1101/018861,"Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however."

Shotgun NGS data analysis revealed high diversity of microbes from Bacteria and Archaea domains. The metabolic potential of the metagenome was reconstructed using the NGS data and the SEED classification in MEGAN shows abundance of virulence factor genes, implying that mangrove soil is potential reservoirs of pathogens."
10.1101/018911,"Limiting dilution assays are commonly used to measure the extent of infection, and in the context of HIV they represent an essential tool for studying latency and potential curative strategies. To assist investigators using dilution assays, we illustrate the major statistical method for estimating the frequency of infected cells (or other infectious units) from assay results, and we offer an online tool for computing this estimate. We then recommend a procedure for optimizing assay design to achieve any desired set of sensitivity and precision goals, subject to experimental constraints. We discuss challenges involved in interpreting experiments in which no viral growth is observed and explain how using alternative measures for viral outgrowth may make measurement of HIV latency more efficient. Finally, we discuss how biological complications - such as probabilistic growth of a small infection in culture - alter interpretations of experimental results."
10.1101/018887,"We have identified a strain of C. neteri SSMD04 isolated from pickled mackerel sashimi that produced N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) type quorum sensing (QS) activity. Tandem mass sspectrometry revealed that C. neteri SSMD04 produced N-butyryl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). We identified a pair of luxIR homologues in this genome that shares the highest similarity with croIR from Citrobacter rodentium. The AHL synthase, which we named it as cneI (636 bp) and at 8bp distance from cneI is a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein, potentially the cognate receptor, a luxR homologue which we named it as cneR. We also found an orphan luxR in this isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the AHL production activity in C. neteri, discovery of its luxI/R homologues and the orphan receptor."
10.1101/018945,"Current methods for processing diffusion MRI (dMRI) to map the connectivity of the human brain require precise delineations of anatomical structures. This requirement has been approached either segmenting the data in native dMRI space or mapping the structural information from T1-weighted (T1w) images. The characteristic features of diffusion data in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, as well as the geometrical distortions caused by the inhomogeneity of magnetic susceptibility across tissues hinder both solutions. Unifying the two approaches, we propose regseg, a surface-to-volume nonlinear registration method that segments homogeneous regions within multivariate images by mapping a set of nested reference-surfaces. Accurate surfaces are extracted from a T1w image of the subject, using as target image the bivariate volume comprehending the fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from the dMRI dataset. We first verify the accuracy of regseg on a general context using digital phantoms. Then we establish an evaluation framework using undistorted dMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and known deformations derived from real inhomogeneity fieldmaps. We analyze the performance of regseg computing the misregistration error of the surfaces estimated after being mapped with regseg onto 16 datasets from the HCP. The distribution of errors shows a 95% CI of 0.56-0.66 mm, that is below the dMRI resolution (1.25 mm, isotropic). Finally, we cross-compare the proposed tool against a nonlinear b0-to-T2w registration method, thereby obtaining a significantly lower misregistration error with regseg. Therefore, we demonstrate that regseg allows the accurate mapping of structural information in dMRI space, enabling the application of new structure-informed techniques in the connectome extraction."
10.1101/018960,"We relate vascular network structure to hemodynamics after vessel obstructions. We consider tree-like networks with a viscoelastic fluid with the rheological characteristics of blood. We analyze the network hemodynamic response, which is a function of the frequencies involved in the driving, and a measurement of the resistance to flow. This response function allows the study of the hemodynamics of the system, without the knowledge of a particular pressure gradient. We find analytical expressions for the network response, that explicitly show the roles played by the network structure, the degree of obstruction, and the geometrical place in which obstructions occur. Notably, we find that the sequence of resistances of the network without occlusions, strongly determines the tendencies that the response function has with the anatomical place where obstructions are located. We identify anatomical sites in a network that are critical for its overall capacity to supply blood to a tissue after obstructions. We demonstrate that relatively small obstructions in such critical sites are able to cause a much larger decrease on flow than larger obstructions placed in non-critical sites. Our results indicate that, to a large extent, the response of the network is determined locally. That is, it depends on the structure that the vasculature has around the place where occlusions are found. This result is manifest in a network that follows Murrays law, which is in reasonable agreement with several mammalian vasculatures. For this one, occlusions in early generation vessels have a radically different effect than occlusions in late generation vessels occluding the same percentage of area available to flow. This locality implies that whenever there is a tissue irrigated by a tree-like in-vivo vasculature, our model is able to interpret how important obstructions are for the irrigation of such tissue."
10.1101/018952,"Biological invasions are one of the main drivers of global change and have negatively impacted all biomes and trophic levels (Hobbs 2000, Vila et al. 2011). While most introduced species fail to establish, or establish small naturalized populations (hereafter exotic species), a few become invasive and rapidly increase in abundance and/or range (hereafter invasives or invaders; Pysek et al. 2004). It is these invader species that are most often linked to negative impacts on native / endemic communities. Although most interactions between invasive and native species at the same trophic level result in negative direct impacts (e.g. plant-plant competitive interactions, Vila et al. 2011), when the invasive plant species can be used as a resource those interactions can also be positive for consumers such as native herbivores, predators or mutualists, at least for some species (Heleno et al. 2009, Bezemer et al. 2004). Entomophilous exotic plant species, for example, not only compete directly for space and light with other plants, but also offer resource opportunities for the native pollinator community (Stouffer et al. 2014). Most research on this topic to date has taken the plant perspective, focusing on how successful plant invaders integrate into the native plant-pollinator interaction networks (Vila et al. 2009), and how this integration in turn impacts the native plant community (Morales and Traveset 2009). However, species specific responses of pollinators to the addition of exotic plants are rarely taken into account. This represent an important gap in our knowledge as pollinator foraging choices determine the structure of interactions within communities, which in turn have important implications for the community stability (Thebault and Fontain 2010) and functioning (Thomson et al. 2012). How different pollinators respond to the changed composition of floral species within the community that results from exotic plant invaders deserves more attention."
10.1101/018937,"Survival in aquatic environments requires organisms to have effective means of collecting information from their surroundings through various sensing strategies. In this study, we explore how sensing mode and range depend on body size. We find a hierarchy of sensing modes determined by body size. With increasing body size, a larger battery of modes becomes available (chemosensing, mechanosensing, vision, hearing, and echolocation, in that order) while the sensing range also increases. This size-dependent hierarchy and the transitions between primary sensory modes are explained on the grounds of limiting factors set by physiology and the physical laws governing signal generation, transmission and reception. We theoretically predict the body size limits for various sensory modes, which align well with size ranges found in literature. The treatise of all ocean life, from unicellular organisms to whales, demonstrates how body size determines available sensing modes, and thereby acts as a major structuring factor of aquatic life."
10.1101/018986,"ABTRACTThe use of recombinant genetic technologies for population manipulation has mostly remained an abstract idea due to the lack of a suitable means to drive novel gene constructs to high frequency in populations. Recently Gantz and Bier showed that the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology could provide an artificial drive mechanism, the so-called Mutagenic Chain Reaction (MCR), which could lead to rapid fixation of even a deleterious introduced allele. We establish the equivalence of this system to models of meiotic drive and review the results of simple models showing that, when there is a fitness cost to the MCR allele, an internal equilibrium exists that is usually unstable. Introductions must be at a frequency above this critical point for the successful invasion of the MCR allele. These modeling results have important implications for application of MCR in natural populations."
10.1101/018929,"The spatiotemporal distribution of recent human adaptation is a long standing question. We developed a new coalescent-based method that collectively assigned human genome regions to modes of neutrality or to positive, negative, or balancing selection. Most importantly, the selection times were estimated for all positive selection signals, which ranged over the last half million years, penetrating the emergence of anatomically modern human (AMH). These selection time estimates were further supported by analyses of the genome sequences from three ancient AMHs and the Neanderthals. A series of brain function-related genes were found to carry signals of ancient selective sweeps, which may have defined the evolution of cognitive abilities either before Neanderthal divergence or during the emergence of AMH. Particularly, signals of brain evolution in AMH are strongly related to Alzheimers disease pathways. In conclusion, this study reports a chronological atlas of natural selection in Human."
10.1101/018978,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) possesses a large and highly repetitive genome of 5.1 Gb that has hindered the development of a complete sequence. In 2012, the International Barley Sequencing Consortium released a resource integrating whole-genome shotgun sequences with a physical and genetic framework. However, since only 6,278 BACs in the physical map were sequenced, detailed fine structure was limited. To gain access to the gene-containing portion of the barley genome at high resolution, we identified and sequenced 15,622 BACs representing the minimal tiling path of 72,052 physical mapped gene-bearing BACs. This generated about 1.7 Gb of genomic sequence containing 17,386 annotated barley genes. Exploration of the sequenced BACs revealed that although distal ends of chromosomes contain most of the gene-enriched BACs and are characterized by high rates of recombination, there are also gene-dense regions with suppressed recombination. Knowledge of these deviant regions is relevant to trait introgression, genome-wide association studies, genomic selection model development and map-based cloning strategies. Sequences and their gene and SNP annotations can be accessed and exported via http://harvest-web.org/hweb/utilmenu.wc or through the software HarvEST:Barley (download from harvest.ucr.edu). In the latter, we have implemented a synteny viewer between barley and Aegilops tauschii to aid in comparative genome analysis."
10.1101/018994,"By benefitting others at a cost to themselves, cooperators face an ever present threat from defectors--individuals that avail themselves of the cooperative benefit without contributing. A longstanding challenge to evolutionary biology is to understand the mechanisms that support the many instances of cooperation that nevertheless exist. Hammarlund et al. recently demonstrated that cooperation can persist by hitchhiking along with beneficial non-social adaptations. Importantly, cooperators play an active role in this process. In spatially-structured environments, clustered cooperator populations reach greater densities, which creates more mutational opportunities to gain beneficial non-social adaptations. Cooperation rises in abundance by association with these adaptations. However, once adaptive opportunities have been exhausted, the ride abruptly ends as cooperators are displaced by adapted defectors. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that the selective feedback that is created as populations construct their local niches can maintain cooperation indefinitely. This cooperator success depends specifically on negative niche construction, which acts as a perpetual source of adaptive opportunities. As populations adapt, they alter their environment in ways that reveal additional opportunities for adaptation. Despite being independent of niche construction in our model, cooperation feeds this cycle. By reaching larger densities, populations of cooperators are better able to adapt to changes in their constructed niche and successfully respond to the constant threat posed by defectors. We relate these findings to previous studies from the niche construction literature and discuss how this model could be extended to provide a greater understanding of how cooperation evolves in the complex environments in which it is found."

These compartments are cell-type specific and are associated with open and closed chromatin. We show that A/B compartments can be reliably estimated using epigenetic data from several different platforms, the Illumina 450k DNA methylation microarray, DNase hypersensitivity sequencing, single-cell ATAC sequencing and single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We do this by exploiting the fact that the structure of long range correlations differs between open and closed compartments. This work makes A/B compartments readily available in a wide variety of cell types, including many human cancers."
10.1101/019026,"AbstractCatheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) account for more than 80% of all healthcare associated infections (HAIs) as compared to non-catheterized urinary tract infections. Catheter associated urinary tract infections occur on the third day after insertion of catheter in patients having urinary tract infection (UTI). In long term catheter use, bio-film form along the catheter which increases the risk of antibiotic resistant pathogens. Most common pathogens involved were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae which produce the enzymes Extended Spectrum {beta}-Lactamases (ESBLs).\n\nObjectiveTo compare the frequency of ESBLs in catheterized and non-catheterized UTI infections.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThis comparative study was conducted at the Microbiology Department, Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore, from June 2014 to January 2015. Urine samples were cultured according to WHO protocol and antimicrobial Susceptibility testing was performed by Modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion Method. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for ESBL production by phenotypic confirmatory method of disk diffusion synergy using a disc of amoxicillin-clavulonate (30g) and ceftrixone (30g), cefotaxime (30g) and aztreonam (30g) discs.\n\nResultsOut of 300 positive urinary isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from CAUTI, 65.33% were ESBL producing isolates whereas out of 300 positive urinary isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from non-catheterized UTI, 47.66% were ESBL producing isolates. The results were highly significant (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusionResults showed that frequency of ESBLs were higher in catheterized patients as compared to non-catheterized patients. This is suggestive of a need for regular screening and surveillance for ESBL producing organisms. Patients infected with these organisms should be nursed with contact precautions to avoid the spread of nosocomial infection."

10.1101/019067,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments now span hundreds to thousands of samples. Current spliced alignment software is designed to analyze each sample separately. Consequently, no information is gained from analyzing multiple samples together, and it is difficult to reproduce the exact analysis without access to original computing resources. We describe Rail-RNA, a cloud-enabled spliced aligner that analyzes many samples at once. Rail-RNA eliminates redundant work across samples, making it more efficient as samples are added. For many samples, Rail-RNA is more accurate than annotation-assisted aligners. We use Rail-RNA to align 667 RNA-seq samples from the GEUVADIS project on Amazon Web Services in under 16 hours for US$0.91 per sample. Rail-RNA produces alignments and base-resolution bigWig coverage files, ready for use with downstream packages for reproducible statistical analysis. We identify expressed regions in the GEUVADIS samples and show that both annotated and unannotated (novel) expressed regions exhibit consistent patterns of variation across populations and with respect to known confounders. Rail-RNA is open-source software available at http://rail.bio."
10.1101/019042,"Due to their relatively low-cost per sample and broad, gene-centric coverage of CpGs across the human genome, Illuminas 450k arrays are widely used in large scale differential methylation studies. However, by their very nature, large studies are particularly susceptible to the effects of unwanted variation. The effects of unwanted variation have been extensively documented in gene expression array studies and numerous methods have been developed to mitigate these effects. However, there has been much less research focused on the appropriate methodology to use for accounting for unwanted variation in methylation array studies. Here we present a novel 2-stage approach using RUV-inverse in a differential methylation analysis of 450k data and show that it outperforms existing methods."

10.1101/018671,"Animal migrations provide important ecological functions and can allow for increased biodiversity through habitat and niche diversification. However, aquatic migrations in general, and those of the worlds largest fish in particular, are imperiled worldwide and are often poorly understood. Several species of large Amazonian catfish carry out some of the longest freshwater fish migrations in the world, travelling from the Amazon River estuary to the Andes foothills. These species are important apex predators in the main stem rivers of the Amazon Basin and make up the regions largest fishery. They are also the only species to utilize the entire Amazon Basin to complete their life cycle. Studies indicate both that the fisheries may be declining due to overfishing, and that the proposed and completed dams in their upstream range threaten spawning migrations. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the details of these species migrations, or their life history. Otolith microchemistry has been an effective method for quantifying and reconstructing fish migrations worldwide across multiple spatial scales and may provide a powerful tool to understand the movements of Amazonian migratory catfish. Our objective was to describe the migratory behaviors of the three most populous and commercially important migratory catfish species, Dourada (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii), Piramutaba (Brachyplatystoma vaillantii), and Piraiba (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum). We collected fish from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Central Amazon and used strontium isotope signatures (87Sr/86Sr) recorded in their otoliths to determine the location of early rearing and subsequent. Fish location was determined through discriminant function classification, using water chemistry data from the literature as a training set. Where water chemistry data was unavailable, we successfully in predicted 87Sr/86Sr isotope values using a regression-based approach that related the geology of the upstream watershed to the Sr isotope ratio. Our results provide the first reported otolith microchemical reconstruction of Brachyplatystoma migratory movements in the Amazon Basin. Our results indicate that juveniles exhibit diverse rearing strategies, rearing in both upstream and estuary environments. This contrasts with the prevailing understanding that juveniles rear in the estuary before migrating upstream; however it is supported by some fisheries data that has indicated the presence of alternate spawning and rearing life-histories. The presence of alternate juvenile rearing strategies may have important implications for conservation and management of the fisheries in the region."
10.1101/019075,"Grey mullets (Mugilidae, Ovalentariae) are coastal fishes found in near-shore environments of tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions within marine, brackish, and freshwater habitats throughout the world. This group is noteworthy both for the highly conserved morphology of its members--which complicates species identification and delimitation--and also for the uncommon herbivorous or detritivorous diet of most mullets. In this study, we first attempt to identify the number of mullet species, and then--for the resulting species--estimate a densely sampled time-calibrated phylogeny using three mitochondrial gene regions and three fossil calibrations. Our results identify two major subgroups of mullets that diverged in the Paleocene/Early Eocene, followed by an Eocene/Oligocene radiation across both tropical and subtropical habitats. We use this phylogeny to explore the evolution of feeding preference in mullets, which indicates multiple independent origins of both herbivorous and detritivorous diets within this group. We also explore correlations between feeding preference and other variables, including body size, habitat (marine, brackish, or freshwater), and geographic distribution (tropical, subtropical, or temperate). Our analyses reveal: (1) a positive correlation between trophic index and habitat (with herbivorous and/or detritivorous species predominantly occurring in marine habitats); (2) a negative correlation between trophic index and geographic distribution (with herbivorous species occurring predominantly in subtropical and temperate regions), and; (3) a negative correlation between body size and geographic distribution (with larger species occurring predominantly in subtropical and temperate regions)."

10.1101/019109,"The uses of the Genome Reference Consortiums human reference sequence can be roughly categorized into three related but distinct categories: as a representative species genome, as a coordinate system for identifying variants, and as an alignment reference for variation detection algorithms. However, the use of this reference sequence as simultaneously a representative species genome and as an alignment reference leads to unnecessary artifacts for structural variation detection algorithms and limits their accuracy. We show how decoupling these two references and developing a separate alignment reference can significantly improve the accuracy of structural variation detection, lead to improved genotyping of disease related genes, and decrease the cost of studying polymorphism in a population."

10.1101/019125,"The evolution of sex in eukaryotes represents a paradox, given the \""two-fold\"" fitness cost it incurs. We hypothesize that the mutational dynamics of the mitochondrial genome would have favoured the evolution of sexual reproduction. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exhibits a high mutation rate across most eukaryote taxa, and several lines of evidence suggest this high rate is an ancestral character. This seems inexplicable given mtDNA-encoded genes underlie the expression of lifes most salient functions, including energy conversion. We propose that negative metabolic effects linked to mitochondrial mutation accumulation would have invoked selection for sexual recombination between divergent host nuclear genomes in early eukaryote lineages. This would provide a mechanism by which recombinant host genotypes could be rapidly shuffled and screened for the presence of compensatory modifiers that offset mtDNA-induced harm. Under this hypothesis, recombination provides the genetic variation necessary for compensatory nuclear coadaptation to keep pace with mitochondrial mutation accumulation."
10.1101/019083,"AbstractSeedling establishment and seed nutritional quality require the sequestration of sufficient element nutrients. Identification of genes and alleles that modify element content in the grains of cereals, including Sorghum bicolor, is fundamental to developing breeding and selection methods aimed at increasing bioavailable element content and improving crop growth.

We measured seed element levels in the genotyped Sorghum Association Panel (SAP), representing all major cultivated sorghum races from diverse geographic and climatic regions, and mapped alleles contributing to seed element variation across three environments by genome-wide association. We observed significant phenotypic and genetic correlation between several elements across multiple years and diverse environments. The power of combining high-precision measurements with genome wide association was demonstrated by implementing rank transformation and a multilocus mixed model (MLMM) to map alleles controlling 20 element traits, identifying 255 loci affecting the sorghum seed ionome. Sequence similarity to genes characterized in previous studies identified likely causative genes for the accumulation of zinc (Zn) manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), calcium (Ca) and cadmium (Cd) in sorghum seed. In addition to strong candidates for these four elements, we provide a list of candidate loci for several other elements. Our approach enabled identification of SNPs in strong LD with causative polymorphisms that can be evaluated in targeted selection strategies for plant breeding and improvement.\n\nOne sentence summaryHigh-throughput measurements of element accumulation and genome-wide association analysis across multiple environments identified novel alleles controlling seed element accumulation in Sorghum bicolor.\n\nThis project was partially funded by the iHUB Visiting Scientist Program (http://www.ionomicshub.org), Chromatin, Inc., NSF EAGER (1450341) to I.B. and BPD, NSF IOS 1126950 to IB, NSF IOS-0919739 to EC, and BMGF (OPP 1052924) to B.P.D."
10.1101/019117,"The Tara Oceans expedition (2009-2013) sampled contrasting ecosystems of the world oceans, collecting environmental data and plankton, from viruses to metazoans, for later analysis using modern sequencing and state-of-the-art imaging technologies. It surveyed 210 ecosystems in 20 biogeographic provinces, collecting over 35000 samples of seawater and plankton. The interpretation of such an extensive collection of samples in their ecological context requires means to explore, assess and access raw and validated data sets. To address this challenge, the Tara Oceans Consortium offers open science resources, including the use of open access archives for nucleotides (ENA) and for environmental, biogeochemical, taxonomic and morphological data (PANGAEA), and the development of on line discovery tools and collaborative annotation tools for sequences and images. Here, we present an overview of Tara Oceans Data, and we provide detailed registries (data sets) of all campaigns (from port-to-port), stations and sampling events."
10.1101/019158,"Many diploid organisms undergo facultative sexual reproduction. However, little is currently known concerning the distribution of neutral genetic variation amongst facultative sexuals except in very simple cases. Under-standing this distribution is important when making inferences about rates of sexual reproduction, effective population size and demographic history. Here, we extend coalescent theory in diploids with facultative sex to consider gene conversion, selfing, population subdivision, and temporal and spatial heterogeneity in rates of sex. In addition to analytical results for two-sample coalescent times, we outline a coalescent algorithm that accommodates the complexities arising from partial sex; this algorithm can be used to generate multi-sample coalescent distributions. A key result is that when sex is rare, gene conversion becomes a significant force in reducing diversity within individuals, which can remove genomic signatures of infrequent sex (the  Meselson Effect) or entirely reverse the predictions. Our models offer improved methods for assessing the null model (I.e. neutrality) of patterns of molecular variation in facultative sexuals."
10.1101/019166,"Gene duplication is a fundamental process in genome evolution. However, most young duplicates are degraded into pseudogenes by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization, especially through evolution of gene expression, while other models focus on sharing of gene dosage. While studies of whole genome duplications tend to support dosage sharing, the primary mechanisms in mammals-where duplications are small-scale and thus disrupt dosage balance- are unclear. Using RNA-seq data from 46 human and 26 mouse tissues we find that sub-functionalization of expression evolves slowly, and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals. A major impediment to subfunctionalization is that tandem duplicates tend to be co-regulated by shared genomic elements, in contrast to the standard assumption of modularity of gene expression. Instead, consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated to match expression of outgroup singleton genes. Our data suggest that dosage sharing of expression is a key factor in the initial survival of mammalian duplicates, followed by slower functional adaptation enabling long-term preservation."
10.1101/019216,"Sophisticated inferential tools coupled with the coalescent model have recently emerged for estimating past population sizes from genomic data. Accurate methods are available for data from a single locus or from independent loci. Recent methods that model recombination require small sample sizes, make constraining assumptions about population size changes, and do not report measures of uncertainty for estimates. Here, we develop a Gaussian process-based Bayesian nonparametric method coupled with a sequentially Markov coalescent model which allows accurate inference of population sizes over time from a set of genealogies. In contrast to current methods, our approach considers a broad class of recombination events, including those that do not change local genealogies. We show that our method outperforms recent likelihood-based methods that rely on discretization of the parameter space. We illustrate the application of our method to multiple demographic histories, including population bottlenecks and exponential growth. In simulation, our Bayesian approach produces point estimates four times more accurate than maximum likelihood estimation (based on the sum of absolute differences between the truth and the estimated values). Further, our methods credible intervals for population size as a function of time cover 90 percent of true values across multiple demographic scenarios, enabling formal hypothesis testing about population size differences over time. Using genealogies estimated with ARGweaver, we apply our method to European and Yoruban samples from the 1000 Genomes Project and confirm key known aspects of population size history over the past 150,000 years."
10.1101/019208,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disabilities that affect social interaction, communication and are characterized by repetitive behaviors. There is now a large body of evidence that suggests a complex role of genetics in ASD, in which many different loci are involved. Although many current population scale genomic studies have been demonstrably fruitful, these studies generally focus on analyzing a limited part of the genome or use a limited set of bioinformatics tools. These limitations preclude the analysis of genome-wide perturbations that may contribute to the development and severity of ASD-related phenotypes. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and utilized an integrative clinical and bioinformatics pipeline for generating a more complete and reliable set of genomic variants for downstream analyses. Our study focuses on the analysis of three simplex autism families consisting of one affected child, unaffected parents, and one unaffected sibling. All members were clinically evaluated and widely phenotyped. Genotyping arrays and whole genome sequencing were performed on each member, and the resulting sequencing data were analyzed using a variety of available bioinformatics tools. We searched for rare variants of putative functional impact that were found to be segregating according to de-novo, autosomal recessive, x-linked, mitochondrial and compound heterozygote transmission models. The resulting candidate variants included three small heterozygous CNVs, a rare heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in MYBBP1A located within exon 1, and a novel de novo missense variant in LAMB3. Our work demonstrates how more comprehensive analyses that include rich clinical data and whole genome sequencing data can generate reliable results for use in downstream investigations. We are moving to implement our framework for the analysis and study of larger cohorts of families, where statistical rigor can accompany genetic findings."
10.1101/019182,"This report includes the discovery and analysis of a pedigree with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and dysautonomia-like symptoms. Nine members of the family participated in whole genome sequencing (WGS), which enabled a wide scope of variant calling from single-nucleotide polymorphisms to copy number variations. First, a 5.5 Mb de novo deletion is identified in the chromosome region 15q11.2 to 15q13.1 in the boy with PWS. Second, a female invididual with HH is homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in HFE, a mutation known to be associated with HH. Her brother is homozygous for the same variant, although he has yet to be clinically diagnosed with HH. Third, none of the people with dysautonomia-like symptoms carry any reported or novel rare variants in IKBKAP that are implicated in familial dysautonomia (FD - HSAN III). Although two people with dysautonomia-like symptoms carry two heterozygous variants in NTRK1, a gene that has been shown to contribute to HSAN IV (congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, a disease that closely resembles FD), this variant is not present in the third proband. Fourth, WGS revealed pharmacogenetic variants influencing the metabolism of warfarin and simvastatin, which are being routinely prescribed to the proband. Finally, reports of the phenotypes were standardized with the Human Phenotype Ontology annotation, which may facilitate the search for other families with similar phenotypes. Due to the extreme heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge of human diseases, it is of crucial importance that both phenotypic data and genomic data are standardized and shared."
10.1101/019174,"This review is devoted to a consideration of the way in which the NADPH oxidase of neutrophils, NOX2, functions to enable the efficient killing of bacteria and fungi. It includes a critical examination of the current dogma that its primary purpose is the generation of hydrogen peroxide as substrate for myeloperoxide catalysed generation of hypochlorite. Instead it is demonstrated that NADPH oxidase functions to optimise the ionic and pH conditions within the vacuole for the solubilisation and optimal activity of the proteins released into this compartment from the cytoplasmic granules, which kill and digest the microbes. The general role of other NOX systems as electrochemical generators to alter the pH and ionic composition in compartments on either side of a membrane in plants and animals will also be examined."
10.1101/019232,"The gut microbiome provides access to otherwise unavailable metabolic and immune functions, likely affecting mammalian fitness and evolution. To investigate how this microbial ecosystem impacts evolutionary adaptation of humans to particular habitats, we explore the gut microbiome and metabolome of the BaAka rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The data demonstrate that the BaAka harbor a colonic ecosystem dominated by Prevotellaceae and other taxa likely related to an increased capacity to metabolize plant structural polysaccharides, phenolics, and lipids. A comparative analysis shows that the BaAka gut microbiome shares similar patterns with that of the Hadza, another hunter-gatherer population from Tanzania. Nevertheless, the BaAka harbor significantly higher bacterial diversity and pathogen load compared to the Hadza, as well as other Western populations. We show that the traits unique to the BaAka microbiome and metabolome likely reflect adaptations to hunter-gatherer lifestyles and particular subsistence patterns. We hypothesize that the observed increase in microbial diversity and potential pathogenicity in the BaAka microbiome has been facilitated by evolutionary adaptations in immunity genes, resulting in a more tolerant immune system.\n\nSignificanceHuman ecological adaptation requires changes at the genomic level. However, the gut microbiome, the collection of microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract and their functions, also responds significantly to ecological challenge. To determine how the gut microbiome responds to evolutionary adaptations in the host, we profiled gut bacterial communities of the BaAka, rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The gut microbiome of the BaAka shows adaptations to metabolize foods rich in fiber, tannins and fats. Similarly, higher bacterial diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria, compared to other hunter-gatherers and western populations, suggest that the BaAka immune system evolved to coexist with increased pathogen threats. Accordingly, these results show how the gut microbiome contributes to human ecological plasticity, impacting host adaptation and evolution."
10.1101/019224,"Under modern interrogation, famously well-studied neural circuits such as that for orientation tuning in V1 are steadily giving up their secrets, but quite basic questions about connectivity and dynamics, including whether most computation is done by lateral processing or by selective feedforward summation, remain unresolved. We show here that grid cells offer a particularly rich opportunity for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of a cortical circuit, through a strategy based on global circuit perturbation combined with sparse neural recordings. The strategy is based on the theoretical insight that small perturbations of circuit activity will result in characteristic quantal shifts in the spatial tuning relationships between grid cells, which should be observable from multisingle unit recordings of a small subsample of the population. The predicted shifts differ qualitatively across candidate recurrent network mechanisms, and also distinguish between recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms. More generally, the proposed strategy demonstrates how sparse neural recordings coupled with global perturbation in the grid cell system can reveal much more about circuit mechanism as it relates to function than can full knowledge of network activity or of the synaptic connectivity matrix."
10.1101/019190,"Memory and learning are thought to result from changes in synaptic strength. Previous studies on synaptic physiology in brain slices have traditionally been focused on biochemical processes. Here, we demonstrate with experiments on mouse brain slices that central nervous system plasticity is also sensitive to mechanical stretch. This is important, given the host of clinical conditions involving changes in mechanical tension on the brain, and the normal role that mechanical tension plays in brain development. A novel platform is developed to investigate neural responses to mechanical stretching. Flavoprotein autofluoresence (FA) imaging was employed for measuring neural activity. We observed that synaptic excitability substantially increases after a small (2.5%) stretch was held for 10 minutes and released. The increase is accumulative, i.e. multiple stretch cycles further increase the excitability. We also developed analytical tools to quantify the spatial spread and response strength. Results show that the spatial spread is less stable in slices undergoing the stretch-unstretch cycle. FA amplitude and activation rate decrease as excitability increases in stretch cases but not in electrically enhanced cases. These results collectively demonstrate that a small stretch in physiological range can modulate neural activities significantly, suggesting that mechanical events can be employed as a novel tool for the modulation of neural plasticity."
10.1101/019257,"Gene regulation in biological systems is impacted by the cellular and genetic context-dependent effects of the biological parts which comprise the circuit. Here, we have sought to elucidate the limitations of engineering biology from an architectural point of view, with the aim of compiling a set of engineering solutions for overcoming failure modes during the development of complex, synthetic genetic circuits. Using a synthetic biology approach that is supported by computational modelling and rigorous characterisation, AND, OR and NOT biological logic gates were layered in both parallel and serial arrangements to generate a repertoire of Boolean operations that include NIMPLY, XOR, half adder and half subtractor logics in single cell. Subsequent evaluation of these near-digital biological systems revealed critical design pitfalls that triggered genetic context dependent effects, including 5 UTR interference and uncontrolled switch-on behaviour of {sigma}54 promoter. Importantly, this work provides a representative case study to the debugging of genetic context dependent effects through principles elucidated herein, thereby providing a rational design framework to program single prokaryotic cell with diversified digital operations."
10.1101/019265,"BackgroundHigh throughput sequencing (HTS) has become one of the primary experimental tools used to extract genomic information from biological samples. Bioinformatics tools are continuously being developed for the analysis of HTS data. Beyond some well-defined core analyses, such as quality control or genomic alignment, the consistent development of custom tools and the representation of sequencing data in organized computational structures and entities remains a challenging effort for bioinformaticians.\n\nResultsIn this work, we present GenOO [jee-noo], an open-source; object-oriented (OO) Perl framework specifically developed for the design and implementation of HTS analysis tools. GenOO models biological entities such as genes and transcripts as Perl objects, and includes relevant modules, attributes and methods that allow for the manipulation of high throughput sequencing data. GenOO integrates these elements in a simple and transparent way which allows for the creation of complex analysis pipelines minimizing the overhead for the researcher. GenOO has been designed with flexibility in mind, and has an easily extendable modular structure with minimal requirements for external tools and libraries. As an example of the frameworks capabilities and usability, we present a short and simple walkthrough of a custom use case in HTS analysis.\n\nConclusionsGenOO is a tool of high software quality which can be efficiently used for advanced HTS analyses. It has been used to develop several custom analysis tools, leading to a number of published works. Using GenOO as a core development module can greatly benefit users, by reducing the overhead and complexity of managing HTS data and biological entities at hand."
10.1101/019315,"SummaryA typical prokaryote population sequencing study can now consist of hundreds or thousands of isolates. Interrogating these datasets can provide detailed insights into the genetic structure of of prokaryotic genomes.

10.1101/019307,"We propose that NADH will exert a specific kill action against some cancers. NADH is a natural metabolite. We envisage a low side effect profile and that NADH therapy will, additionally, combat the wastage and weakness of cancer patients, which can be the cause of death in some cases. Significantly, NADH can be administered orally and has already cleared clinical trials, all be it for other pathologies.\n\nBackgroundAerobic respiration consists of glycolysis in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria: the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [1, 2]. It requires O2 and net yields 30 ATPs from one glucose molecule. Anaerobic respiration, consisting of glycolysis only, does not require O2 but produces merely 2 ATPs from one glucose molecule. When O2 is available, normal animal cells tend to favour aerobic respiration because of its higher ATP yield."
10.1101/019240,"The study of microbial evolution is hindered by the fact that microbial populations leave few fossils. We hypothesized that bacterial cells preserved in ancient ice could be used as a molecular fossil record if their DNA could be extracted and sequenced. Channels formed along triple junctions of ice crystals contain liquid \""veins\"" in which microbial cells may be preserved intact. Since vertical motion through the ice matrix is impossible, microbes found in ice cores are representative of microbes present at the time the ice was formed. We detected chlorophyll fluorescence in intact ice cores taken from Greenland and Antarctica. Flow cytometric analysis localized at least some of this fluorescence to particles < 1 m in diameter. Metagenomic analysis of meltwater indeed revealed sequences similar to modern strains of the picocyanobacterial genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, and some of these sequences were distinct from any sequences known from modern oceans or glacial environments. Our study is a first proof-of-concept of the use of ice cores as records of microbial evolution, and we suggest that future genetic studies with higher vertical resolution in the cores might shed light on the pace and character of evolution of these ecologically important cells."
10.1101/019323,"Most biological traits are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Individual loci contributing to the phenotypic diversity in a population are generally identified by their contributions to the trait mean. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses can also detect loci based on variance differences between genotypes and several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the possible genetic mechanisms leading to such signals. Little is, however, known about what causes them and whether this genetic variance-heterogeneity reflects mechanisms of importance in natural populations. Previously, we identified a variance-heterogeneity GWA (vGWA) signal for leaf molybdenum concentrations in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, fine-mapping of this association to a [~]78 kb Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)-block reveals that it emerges from the independent effects of three genetic polymorphisms on the high-variance associated version of this LD-block. By revealing the genetic architecture underlying this vGWA signal, we uncovered the molecular source of a significant amount of hidden additive genetic variation (\""missing heritability\""). Two of the three polymorphisms on the high-variance LD-block are promoter variants for Molybdate transporter 1 (MOT1), and the third a variant located [~]25 kb downstream of this gene. A fourth independent association was also detected [~]600 kb upstream of the LD-block. Testing of T-DNA knockout alleles for genes in the associated regions suggest AT2G25660 (unknown function) and AT2G26975 (Copper Transporter 6; COPT6) as the strongest candidates for the associations outside MOT1. Our results show that multi-allelic genetic architectures within a single LD-block can lead to a variance-heterogeneity between genotypes in natural populations. Further they provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of ion homeostasis in A. thaliana, and empirically confirm that variance-heterogeneity based GWA methods are a valuable tool to detect novel associations of biological importance in natural populations."
10.1101/019299,"Genome scans, including both genome-wide association studies and deep sequencing, continue to discover a growing number of significant association signals for various traits. However, often variants meeting genome-wide significance criteria explain far less of the overall trait variance than \""sub-threshold\"" association signals. To extract these sub-threshold signals, there is a need for methods which accurately estimate the mean of all (normally-distributed) test-statistics from a genome scan (i.e., Z-scores). This is currently achieved by the difficult procedures of adjusting all Z-score [Formula] statistics for \""winners curse\"" (multiple testing). Given that multiple testing adjustments are much simpler for p-values, we propose a method for estimating Z-scores means by i) first adjusting their p-values for multiple testing and then ii) transforming the adjusted p-values to upper tail Z-scores with the sign of the original statistics. Because a False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure is used for multiple testing adjustment, we denote this method FDR Inverse Quantile Transformation (FIQT). When compared to competitors, e.g. Empirical Bayes (including proposed improvements), FIQT is more i) accurate and ii) computationally efficient by orders of magnitude. Its accuracy advantage is substantial at larger sample sizes and/or moderate numbers of association signals. Practical application of FIQT to Z-scores from the first Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia predicts a non-trivial fraction of the significant signal regions from the subsequent published PGC schizophrenia studies. Finally, we suggest that FIQT might be i) used to improve subject level risk prediction and ii) further improved by modelling the noncentrality of [Formula] statistics."

10.1101/019356,"The recently introduced Oxford Nanopore MinION platform generates DNA sequence data in real-time. This opens immense potential to shorten the sample-to-results time and is likely to lead to enormous benefits in rapid diagnosis of bacterial infection and identification of drug resistance. However, there are very few tools available for streaming analysis of real-time sequencing data. Here, we present a framework for streaming analysis of MinION real-time sequence data, together with probabilistic streaming algorithms for species typing, multi-locus strain typing, gene presence strain-typing and antibiotic resistance profile identification. Using three culture isolate samples as well as a mixed-species sample, we demonstrate that bacterial species and strain information can be obtained within 30 minutes of sequencing and using about 500 reads, initial drug-resistance profiles within two hours, and complete resistance profiles within 10 hours. Multi-locus strain typing required more than 15x coverage to generate confident assignments, whereas gene-presence typing could detect the presence of a known strain with 0.5x coverage. We also show that our pipeline can process over 100 times more data than the current throughput of the MinION on a desktop computer."
10.1101/019349,"The reproducibility of experiments is key to the scientific process, and particularly necessary for accurate reporting of analyses in data-rich fields such as phylogenomics. We present ReproPhylo, a phylogenomic analysis environment developed to ensure experimental reproducibility, to facilitate the handling of large-scale data, and to assist methodological experimentation. Reproducibility, and instantaneous repeatability, is built in to the ReproPhylo system, and does not require user intervention or configuration because it stores the experimental workflow as a single, serialized Python object containing explicit provenance and environment information. This  single file approach ensures the persistence of provenance across iterations of the analysis, with changes automatically managed by the version control program Git. ReproPhylo produces an extensive human-readable report, and generates a comprehensive experimental archive file, both of which are suitable for submission with publications. The system facilitates thorough experimental exploration of both parameters and data. ReproPhylo is a platform independent CC0 python module, and is easily installed as a Docker image, with an Jupyter GUI, or as a slimmer version in a Galaxy distribution."
10.1101/019406,"Distant metastasis (DM) and local-regional recurrence (LR) after radiation and chemo therapy are major cause of treatment failure for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, detailed underlying mechanisms leading to DM and LR in patients are not fully understood yet. MiRNA have been proposed as biomarkers in a variety of biological and medical conditions such as cancer and stress response. The advantages of miRNA as a biomarker lies in its stability in tissues as well as body fluids, hence the potential for non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, towards understanding the molecular mechanism causing DM and LR in HN cancer patients we performed miRNA expression profiling using tumor samples from 118 head and neck cancer patients treated by post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1992 to 1999. All patients were considered to be at high-risk for recurrence having histologically proven advanced squamous cell carcinoma. Amongst these samples, 41 found to have distant metastasis (DM), 53 responded without relapse (no evidence of disease (NED)) to PORT. Comparison of miRNA expression between DM and NED specimens using two-way ANOVA identified 28 miRNAs that were differentially expressed with statistical significance (FDR < 0.2 and fold change > 1.5). Amongst these 28 miRNAs seen in the DM and NED outcome groups, miRNAs 551a and 551b are significantly associated with the DM group. Interestingly these two miRNAs share same seed sequence. Moreover Kaplan-Meir survival analysis in our data set and two other data sets suggested that miR-551a and miR-551b expressions are associated with poor survival in patients. We further performed cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays using the HN5 and UMSCC-17B head and neck cancer cell lines by transfection of either mimic or an inhibitor of miR-551a and miR-551b. The results suggested that miR-551a and miR-551b mimics promote proliferation, migration and invasion whereas the inhibitor decreased. Further studies indicated that these miRNAs target GLIPR2 expression and miR-551a, miR-551b and GLIPR2 axis at least in part plays an important role in tumor progression. Hence we need to further explore miR-551a and miR-551b-3p role in HN cancer progression in detail in in-vivo models to use them as therapeutic targets in future."
10.1101/019430,"Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen associated with serious gastric diseases. Owing to its medical importance and close relationship with its human host, understanding genomic patterns of global and local adaptation in H. pylori may be of particular significance for both clinical and evolutionary studies. Here we present the first such whole-genome analysis of 60 globally distributed strains, from which we inferred worldwide population structure and demographic history and shed light on interesting global and local events of positive selection, with particular emphasis on the evolution of San-associated lineages. Our results indicate a more ancient origin for the association of humans and H. pylori than previously thought.

10.1101/019372,"Background: The human genome contains variants ranging in size from small single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to large structural variants (SVs). High-quality benchmark small variant calls for the pilot National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Material (NA12878) have been developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, but no similar high-quality benchmark SV calls exist for this genome. Since SV callers output highly discordant results, we developed methods to combine multiple forms of evidence from multiple sequencing technologies to classify candidate SVs into likely true or false positives. Our method (svclassify) calculates annotations from one or more aligned bam files from many high-throughput sequencing technologies, and then builds a one-class model using these annotations to classify candidate SVs as likely true or false positives.\n\nResults: We first used pedigree analysis to develop a set of high-confidence breakpoint-resolved large deletions. We then used svclassify to cluster and classify these deletions as well as a set of high-confidence deletions from the 1000 Genomes Project and a set of breakpoint-resolved complex insertions from Spiral Genetics. We find that likely SVs cluster separately from likely non-SVs based on our annotations, and that the SVs cluster into different types of deletions. We then developed a supervised one-class classification method that uses a training set of random non-SV regions to determine whether candidate SVs have abnormal annotations different from most of the genome. To test this classification method, we use our pedigree-based breakpoint-resolved SVs, SVs validated by the 1000 Genomes Project, and assembly-based breakpoint-resolved insertions, along with semi-automated visualization using svviz.\n\nConclusions: We find that candidate SVs with high scores from multiple technologies have high concordance with PCR validation and an orthogonal consensus method MetaSV (99.7% concordant), and candidate SVs with low scores are questionable. We distribute a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with high svclassify scores from these call sets for benchmarking SV callers. We expect these methods to be particularly useful for establishing high-confidence SV calls for benchmark samples that have been characterized by multiple technologies."
10.1101/019380,"We elaborate a framework for investigating the evolutionary history of morphological characters. We argue that morphological character trees generated by phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes provide a useful tool for identifying causal gene expression differences underlying the development and evolution of morphological characters. They also enable rigorous testing of different models of morphological character evolution and origination, including the hypothesis that characters originate via divergence of repeated ancestral characters. Finally, morphological character trees provide evidence that character transcriptomes undergo concerted evolution. We argue that concerted evolution of transcriptomes can explain the so-called \""species-specific clustering\"" found in several recent comparative transcriptome studies. The species signal is the phenomenon that transcriptomes cluster by species rather than character type, even though the characters are older than the respective species. We suggest that concerted gene expression evolution results from mutations that alter gene regulatory network interactions shared by the characters under comparison. Thus, character trees generated from transcriptomes allow us to investigate the variational independence, or individuation, of morphological characters at the level of genetic programs."
10.1101/019398,"Organisms and ecological groups accumulate evidence to make decisions. Classic experiments and theoretical studies have explored this process when the correct choice is fixed during each trial. However, the natural world constantly changes. Using sequential analysis we derive a tractable model of evidence accumulation when the correct option changes in time. Our analysis shows that ideal observers discount prior evidence at a rate determined by the volatility of the environment, and that the dynamics of evidence accumulation is governed by the information gained over an average environmental epoch. A plausible neural implementation of an optimal observer in a changing environment shows that, in contrast to previous models, neural populations representing alternate choices are coupled through excitation."
10.1101/019414,"Molecular clocks give \""Time to most recent common ancestor\"" TMRCA of genetic trees. By Watson-Galton17 most lineages terminate, with a few overrepresented singular lineages generated by W. Hamiltons \""kin selection\""13. Applying current methods to this non-uniform branching produces greatly exaggerated TMRCA. We introduce an inhomogenous stochastic process which detects singular lineages by asymmetries, whose reduction gives true TMRCA. This implies a new method for computing mutation rates. Despite low rates similar to mitosis data, reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. We establish accuracy by a comparison across a wide range of time, indeed this is only clock giving consistent results for both short and long term times. In particular we show that the dominant European y-haplotypes R1a1a & R1b1a2, expand from c3700BC, not reaching Anatolia before c3300BC. While this contradicts current clocks which date R1b1a2 to either the Neolithic Near East4 or Paleo-Europe20, our dates support recent genetic analysis of ancient skeletons by Reich23."
10.1101/019539,"MotivationGenome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a great success in the past decade. However, significant challenges still remain in both identifying new risk loci and interpreting results. Bonferroni-corrected significance level is known to be conservative, leading to insufficient statistical power when the effect size is moderate at risk locus. Complex structure of linkage disequilibrium also makes it challenging to separate causal variants from nonfunctional ones in large haplotype blocks.\n\nResultsWe describe GenoWAP, a post-GWAS prioritization method that integrates genomic functional annotation and GWAS test statistics. The effectiveness of GenoWAP is demonstrated through its applications to Crohns disease and schizophrenia using the largest studies available, where highly ranked loci show substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after prioritization based on a subset of samples. At the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, top ranked SNPs after prioritization have both higher replication rates and consistently stronger enrichment of eQTLs. Within each risk locus, GenoWAP is also able to distinguish functional sites from groups of correlated SNPs.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationGenoWAP is freely available on the web at http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoWAP"
10.1101/019505,"Cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of death in Europe, and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. With the advancements in genomic tools and technologies there is potential to predict and diagnose heart disease using molecular data from analysis of blood cells. We analyzed gene expression data from blood samples taken from normal people (n=21), non-significant coronary artery disease (n=93), patients with unstable angina (n=16), stable coronary artery disease (n=14) and myocardial infarction (MI; n=207). We used a feature selection approach to identify a set of gene expression variables which successfully differentiate different cardiovascular diseases. The initial features were discovered by fitting a linear model for each probe set across all arrays of normal individuals and patients with myocardial infarction. Three different feature optimisation algorithms were devised which identified two most discriminating sets of genes one using MI and normal controls (total genes=8) and another one using MI and unstable angina patients (total genes=17). The results proved the diagnostic robustness of the final feature sets in discriminating not only patients with myocardial infraction from healthy controls but also from patients with clinical symptoms of cardiac ischemia with myocardial necrosis and stable coronary artery disease despite the influence of batch effects and different microarray gene chips and platforms. selection approach to identify a set of gene expression variables which successfully differentiate different cardiovascular diseases.

10.1101/019448,"The single-molecule accuracy of nanopore sequencing has been an area of rapid academic and commercial advancement, but remains insufficient for the de novo analysis of genomes. We introduce here a novel algorithm for the error correction of nanopore data, utilizing statistical models of the physical system in order to obtain high accuracy de novo sequences at a range of coverage depths. We demonstrate the technique by sequencing M13 bacteriophage DNA to 99% accuracy at moderate coverage as well as its use in an assembly pipeline by sequencing {lambda} DNA at a range of coverages. We also show the algorithms ability to accurately classify sequence variants at far lower coverage than existing methods."
10.1101/019497,"Food webs represent the set of consumer-resource interactions among a set of species that co-occur in a habitat, but most food web studies have omitted parasites and their interactions. Recent studies have provided conflicting evidence on whether including parasites changes food web structure, with some suggesting that parasitic interactions are structurally distinct from those among free-living species while others claim the opposite. Here, we describe a principled method for understanding food web structure that combines an efficient optimization algorithm from statistical physics called parallel tempering with a probabilistic generalization of the empirically well-supported food web niche model. This generative model approach allows us to rigorously estimate the degree to which interactions that involve parasites are statistically distinguishable from interactions among freeliving species, whether parasite niches behave similarly to free-living niches, and the degree to which existing hypotheses about food web structure are naturally recovered. We apply this method to the well-studied Flensburg Fjord food web and show that while predation on parasites, concomitant predation of parasites, and parasitic intraguild trophic interactions are largely indistinguishable from free-living predation interactions, parasite-host interactions are different. These results provide a powerful new tool for evaluating the impact of classes of species and interactions on food web structure to shed new light on the roles of parasites in food webs."
10.1101/019513,"Genetic mapping studies of quantitative traits typically focus on detecting loci that contribute additively to trait variation. Genetic interactions are often proposed as a contributing factor to trait variation, but the relative contribution of interactions to trait variation is a subject of debate. Here, we use a very large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate the fraction of phenotypic variance due to pairwise QTL-QTL interactions for 20 quantitative traits. We find that this fraction is 9% on average, substantially less than the contribution of additive QTL (43%). Statistically significant QTL-QTL pairs typically have small individual effect sizes, but collectively explain 40% of the pairwise interaction variance. We show that pairwise interaction variance is largely explained by pairs of loci at least one of which has a significant additive effect. These results refine our understanding of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and help guide future mapping studies."
10.1101/019547,"Selective attention causes visual cortical neurons to act as if only one of multiple stimuli are within their receptive fields. This suggests that attention employs a, yet unknown, neuronal gating mechanism for transmitting only the information that is relevant for the current behavioral context. We introduce an experimental paradigm to causally investigate this putative gating and the mechanism underlying selective attention by determining the signal availability of two time-varying stimuli in local field potentials of V4 neurons. We find transmission of the low frequency (<20Hz) components only from the attended visual input signal and that the higher frequencies from both stimuli are attenuated. A minimal model implementing routing by synchrony replicates the attentional gating effect and explains the spectral transfer characteristics of the signals. It supports the proposal that selective gamma-band synchrony subserves signal routing in cortex and further substantiates our experimental finding that attention selectively gates signals already at the level of afferent synaptic input."
10.1101/019521,"Parasite effector proteins target various host cell compartments to alter host processes and promote infection. How effectors cross membrane-rich interfaces to reach these compartments is a major question in effector biology. Growing evidence suggests that effectors use molecular mimicry to subvert host cell machinery for protein sorting. We recently identified CTP1 (chloroplast-targeted protein 1), a candidate effector from the poplar leaf rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina that carries a predicted transit peptide and accumulates in chloroplasts. Here, we show that the CTP1 transit peptide is necessary and sufficient for accumulation in the stroma of chloroplasts, and is cleaved after translocation. CTP1 is part of a Melampsora-specific family of polymorphic secreted proteins whose members translocate and are processed in chloroplasts in a N-terminal signal-dependent manner. Our findings reveal that fungi have evolved effector proteins that mimic plant-specific sorting signals to traffic within plant cells."
10.1101/019471,"O_LIThe first layer of plant immunity is activated by cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and proteins (RLPs) that detect infectious pathogens. Constitutive interaction with the RLK SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1 (SOBIR1) contributes to RLP stability and kinase activity. As RLK activation requires transphosphorylation with a second associated RLK, it remains elusive how RLPs initiate downstream signaling. To address this, we investigated functioning of Cf RLPs that mediate immunity of tomato against Cladosporium fulvum.\nC_LIO_LIWe employed live-cell imaging and co-immunoprecipitation in tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the requirement of associated kinases for Cf activity and ligand-induced subcellular trafficking of Cf-4.\nC_LIO_LIUpon elicitation with the matching effector ligands Avr4 and Avr9, BRI1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) associates with Cf-4 and Cf-9. Furthermore, Cf-4 that interacts with SOBIR1 at the plasma membrane, is recruited to late endosomes after elicitation. Significantly, BAK1 is required for Avr4-triggered endocytosis, effector-triggered defenses in Cf-4 plants and resistance of tomato against C. fulvum.\nC_LIO_LIOur observations indicate that RLP-mediated immune signaling and endocytosis require ligand-induced recruitment of BAK1, reminiscent of BAK1 interaction and subcellular fate of the FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 RLK.

10.1101/019596,"BackgroundMicroarray technologies are established approaches for high throughput gene expression, methylation and genotyping analysis. An accurate mapping of the array probes is essential to generate reliable biological findings. Manufacturers typically provide incomplete and outdated annotation tables, which often rely on older genome and transcriptome versions differing substantially from up-to-date sequence databases.\n\nResultsHere, we present the Re-Annotator, a re-annotation pipeline for microarrays. It is primarily designed for gene expression microarrays but can be adapted to other types of microarrays. The Re-Annotator is based on a custom-built mRNA reference, used to identify the positions of gene expression array probe sequences. A comparison of our re-annotation of the Human-HT12-v4 microarray to the manufacturers annotation led to over 25% differently interpreted probes.\n\nConclusionsA thorough re-annotation of probe information is crucial to any microarray analysis.

Re-annotation files for Illumina microarrays Human HT-12 v3/v4 and MouseRef-8 v2 are available as well."
10.1101/019604,"The tumor growth paradox refers to the observation that incomplete treatment of cancers can enhance their growth. As shown here and elsewhere, the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) can explain this effect. CSC are less sensitive to treatments, hence any stress applied to the tumor selects for CSC, thereby increasing the fitness of the tumor. In this paper we use a mathematical model to understand the role of CSC in the progression of cancer. Our model is a rather general system of integro-differential equations for tumor growth and tumor spread. Such a model has never been analysed, and we prove results on local and global existence of solutions, their uniqueness and their boundedness. We show numerically that this model exhibits the tumor growth paradox for all parameters tested. This effect becomes more relevant for small renewal rate of the CSC."
10.1101/019455,"Direct reprogramming technology has emerged as an outstanding technique for the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and various specialized cells directly from somatic cells of different species. Recent studies dissecting the molecular mechanisms of reprogramming have methodologically improved the quality, ease and efficiency of reprogramming and eliminated the need for genome modifications with integrating viral vectors. With these advancements, direct reprogramming technology has moved closer to clinical application. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the cutting-edge findings regarding distinct barriers of reprogramming to pluripotency, strategies to enhance reprogramming efficiency, and chemical reprogramming as one of the non-integrating approaches in iPS cell generation. In addition to direct transdifferentiation, pluripotency factor-induced transdifferentiation or cell activation and signaling directed (CASD) lineage conversion is described as a robust strategy for the generation of both tissue-specific progenitors and clinically relevant cell types. Then, we consider the possibility that a combined method of inhibition of roadblocks (e.g. p53, p21, p57, Mbd3, etc.), and application of enhancing factors in a chemical reprogramming paradigm would be an almost safe, reliable and effective approach in pluripotent reprogramming and transdifferentiation. Furthermore, with respect to the state of native, aberrant, and target gene regulatory networks in reprogrammed cell populations, CellNet is reviewed as a computational platform capable of evaluating the fidelity of reprogramming methods and refining current engineering strategies. Ultimately, we conclude that a faithful, highly efficient and integration-free reprogramming paradigm would provide powerful tools for research studies, drug-based induced regeneration, cell transplantation therapies and other regenerative medicine purposes."

However, in groups with no obvious morphological innovations, observed upticks in diversification rates have also been attributed to the colonization of a new geographic environment. In this study, we explore the systematics, diversification dynamics, and historical biogeography of the plant clade Rhinantheae in the Orobanchaceae, with a special focus on the Andean clade of the genus Bartsia L..\n\nMethodsWe sampled taxa from across Rhinantheae, including a representative sample of Andean Bartsia species. Using standard phylogenetic methods, we reconstructed evolutionary relationships, inferred divergence times among the clades of Rhinantheae, elucidated their biogeographic history, and investigated diversification dynamics.\n\nKey resultsWe confirmed that the South American Bartsia species form a highly supported monophyletic group. The median crown age of Rhinantheae was determined to be ca. 30 Ma, and Europe played an important role in the biogeographic history of the lineages. South America was first reconstructed in the biogeographic analyses around 9 Ma, and with a median age of 2.59 Ma, this clade shows a significant uptick in diversification.\n\nConclusionsIncreased net diversification of the South American clade corresponds with biogeographic movement into the New World. This happened at a time when the Andes were reaching the necessary elevation to host an alpine environment. Although a specific route could not be identified with certainty, we provide plausible hypotheses to how the group colonized the New World."
10.1101/019570,"The ability to precisely modify the genome in a site-specific manner is extremely useful. The CRISPR/Cas9 system facilitates precise modifications by generating RNA-guided double-strand breaks. We demonstrate that guide RNA pairs generate deletions that are repaired with a high level of precision by non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells. We present a method called knock-in blunt ligation for exploiting this excision and repair to insert exogenous sequences in a homology-independent manner without loss of additional nucleotides. We successfully utilize this method in a human immortalized cell line and induced pluripotent stem cells to insert fluorescent protein cassettes into various loci, with efficiencies up to 35.8% in HEK293 cells. We also present a version of Cas9 fused to the FKBP12-L106P destabilization domain for investigating repair dynamics of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks. Our in vivo blunt-end cloning method and destabilization-domain-fused Cas9 variant increase the repertoire of precision genome engineering approaches."
10.1101/019562,"Identifying sources of variation in DNA methylation levels is important for understanding gene regulation. Recently, bisulfite sequencing has become a popular tool for investigating DNA methylation levels. However, modeling bisulfite sequencing data is complicated by dramatic variation in coverage across sites and individual samples, and because of the computational challenges of controlling for genetic covariance in count data. To address these challenges, we present a binomial mixed model and an efficient, sampling-based algorithm (MACAU: Mixed model association for count data via data augmentation) for approximate parameter estimation and p-value computation. This framework allows us to simultaneously account for both the over-dispersed, count-based nature of bisulfite sequencing data, as well as genetic relatedness among individuals. Using simulations and two real data sets (whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data from Arabidopsis thaliana and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from baboons), we show that our method provides well-calibrated test statistics in the presence of population structure. Further, it improves power to detect differentially methylated sites: in the RRBS data set, MACAU detected 1.6-fold more age-associated CpG sites than a beta-binomial model (the next best approach). Changes in these sites are consistent with known age-related shifts in DNA methylation levels, and are enriched near genes that are differentially expressed with age in the same population. Taken together, our results indicate that MACAU is an efficient, effective tool for analyzing bisulfite sequencing data, with particular salience to analyses of structured populations. MACAU is freely available at www.xzlab.org/software.html.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in regulating gene expression. It can be measured at base-pair resolution, on a genome-wide scale, by coupling sodium bisulfite conversion with high-throughput sequencing (a technique known as  bisulfite sequencing). However, the data generated by such methods present several challenges for statistical analysis. In particular, while the raw data generated from bisulfite sequencing experiments are read counts, they are often converted to proportions for ease of modeling, resulting in loss of information. Furthermore, although DNA methylation levels are known to be heritable--and are thus affected by kinship and population structure--existing approaches for modeling bisulfite sequencing data fail to account for this covariance. Such failure can lead to spurious associations and reduced power. Here, we present a new approach that models bisulfite sequencing data using raw read counts, while also taking into account population structure and other sources of data over-dispersion. Using simulations and two real data sets (publicly available data from Arabidopsis thaliana and newly generated data from Papio cynocephalus), we demonstrate that our model provides well-calibrated p-values and improves power compared with previous methods. In addition, the DNA methylation patterns identified by our method agree with those reported in previous studies."
10.1101/019620,"A central goal of synthetic biology is to engineer cellular behavior by engineering synthetic gene networks for a variety of biotechnology and medical applications. The process of engineering gene networks often involves an iterative  design-build-test cycle, whereby the parts and connections that make up the network are built, characterized and varied until the desired network function is reached. Many advances have been made in the design and build portions of this cycle. However, the slow process of in vivo characterization of network function often limits the timescale of the testing step. Cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) systems offer a simple and fast alternative to performing these characterizations in cells. Here we provide an overview of a cell-free TX-TL system that utilizes the native Escherichia coli TX-TL machinery, thereby allowing a large repertoire of parts and networks to be characterized. As a way to demonstrate the utility of cell-free TX-TL, we illustrate the characterization of two genetic networks: an RNA transcriptional cascade and a protein regulated incoherent feed-forward loop. We also provide guidelines for designing TX-TL experiments to characterize new genetic networks. We end with a discussion of current and emerging applications of cell free systems.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/019588,"Cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell to cell variation and cell progression at different rates. Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our methods utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq data sets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis data set, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of cross-sectional time series."
10.1101/019638,"Gene expression is intrinsically stochastic due to the small number of molecules involved in some of the underlying biochemical reactions. The resulting molecule-count random fluctuations are known as biochemical noise. The dynamic effects of intrinsic noise (that originated within the system) have been widely studied. However, the effects of the noise coming from other sources the system is in contact with, or extrinsic noise, is not so well understood. In this work we introduce an electronic model for a simple gene oscillatory network, with delayed negative-feedback regulation. Notably, this model accounts for the intrinsic biochemical noise due to the slow promoter switching between the active and inactive states; but dismisses biochemical noise due to mRNA and protein production and degradation. We characterize the oscillatory behavior of this gene network by varying all the relevant parameter values within biologically meaningful ranges. Finally, we investigate how different sources of extrinsic noise affect the system dynamic behavior. To simulate extrinsic noise we consider stochastic time series coming from another circuit simulating a gene network. Our results indicate that, depending on the parameter affected by extrinsic noise and the power spectra of the stochastic time series, the system quasi-periodic behavior is affected in different ways."
10.1101/019612,"The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to the classical \""hard sweep\"" hitchhiking model, recent research has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation can play out in a variety of different ways, and that the specific signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for which a large number of empirical examples are already known is that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of the environmental change can be approximated by considering recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite alleles model. We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep, and multiple mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general, adaptation from a uniquely derived standing variant will be difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data alone, and when it can be detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other varieties of selective sweeps."
10.1101/019653,"BackgroundThe adduction of the first pedal ray in humans, such that the hallux is incapable of functional opposability, is a major feature of the evolution of the hominin foot (e.g. Darwin 1872, Haeckel 1879, Latimer and Lovejoy 1990). While hallucal adduction facilitates obligate bipedalism, it inhibits but does not eliminate arboreal grasping ability. The angle of the hallux (as determined by the longitudinal axis of the first metatarsal) relative to the rest of the foot (as determined by the longitudinal axis of the second metatarsal) is a product of both hard-and soft-tissues. Given the failure of soft tissue to fossilize, direct evidence for hallucal angle evolution is scanty, and consensus has not emerged as to when and how the modern human condition of hallucal non-opposability evolved.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsAnalysis of a large sample (n = 331) of radiographs taken from the dorsal aspect of living human feet elucidates the relationship between osteological measures and the magnitude of hallucal adduction, which is resultant of both hard-and soft-tissue anatomy (Lovejoy et al. 2009). I describe the correlation of hallucal convergence with first metatarsal posterior articular facet morphology, which allows inference of hallucal convergence in the absence of the medial cuneiform. I report parameters of modern human hallucal convergence variation and offer insight into the hominin fossil record. I infer that the hallucal convergence of the recently reported specimen from Burtele (BRT-VP-2/73) falls within the range of living human variation, inconsistent with the interpretation that this hominin retained the ability to oppose its great toe for the purpose of arboreal locomotion (Haile-Selassie et al. 2012). Of the fossil hominin first metatarsals surveyed, all fall within the range of living human variation, consistent with previous research on medial cuneiform (McHenry and Jones 2006) and first metatarsal (Berillon 1999) morphology.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis study finds that the modern human condition of hallucal non-opposability was present in the genus Australopithecus. However, while the Burtele specimen (BRT-VP-2/73) falls within the range of living human variation, it displays a markedly divergent hallux compared to most living humans. This study suggests that, as in humans today, there was variation in hallucal divergence in Plio-Pleistocene hominins. Rather than using the terms  opposability and the ambiguously synonymous  grasping, I suggest here the term  clamping (as in the motion performed by a clamp) be used to describe the less powerful and less dexterous ability of modern humans to place and hold a thin, narrow object between the great toe and second toe ray in a limited, albeit functional, manner."
10.1101/019737,"Artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum is advancing across Southeast Asia in a soft selective sweep involving at least 20 independent kelch13 mutations. In a large global survey, we find that kelch13 mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally, and that kelch13 shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of standing variation that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions."
10.1101/019661,"The identification of gene-gene and gene-environment interaction in human traits and diseases is an active area of research that generates high expectation, and most often lead to high disappointment. This is partly explained by a misunderstanding of some of the inherent characteristics of interaction effects. Here, I untangle several theoretical aspects of standard regression-based interaction tests in genetic association studies. In particular, I discuss variables coding scheme, interpretation of effect estimate, power, and estimation of variance explained in regard of various hypothetical interaction patterns. I show first that the simplest biological interaction models--in which the magnitude of a genetic effect depends on a common exposure--are among the most difficult to identify. Then, I demonstrate the demerits of the current strategy to evaluate the contribution of interaction effects to the variance of quantitative outcomes and argue for the use of new approaches to overcome these issues. Finally I explore the advantages and limitations of multivariate models when testing for interaction between multiple SNPs and/or multiple exposures, using either a joint test, or a test of interaction based on risk score. Theoretical and simulated examples presented along the manuscript demonstrate that the application of these methods can provide a new perspective on the role of interaction in multifactorial traits."

10.1101/019711,"The Out-of-Africa (OOA) dispersal ~50,000 years ago is characterized by a series of founder events as modern humans expanded into multiple continents. Population genetics theory predicts an increase of mutational load in populations undergoing serial founder effects during range expansions. To test this hypothesis, we have sequenced full genomes and high-coverage exomes from 7 geographically divergent human populations from Namibia, Congo, Algeria, Pakistan, Cambodia, Siberia and Mexico. We find that individual genomes vary modestly in the overall number of predicted deleterious alleles. We show via spatially explicit simulations that the observed distribution of deleterious allele frequencies is consistent with the OOA dispersal, particularly under a model where deleterious mutations are recessive. We conclude that there is a strong signal of purifying selection at conserved genomic positions within Africa, but that many predicted deleterious mutations have evolved as if they were neutral during the expansion out of Africa. Under a model where selection is inversely related to dominance, we show that OOA populations are likely to have a higher mutation load due to increased allele frequencies of nearly neutral variants that are recessive or partially recessive."
10.1101/019646,"Resting-state functional connectivity is a promising biomarker for Alzheimers disease. However, previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in Alzheimers disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have shown limited reproducibility as they have had small sample sizes and substantial variation in study protocol. We sought to identify functional brain networks and connections that could consistently discriminate normal aging from MCI despite variations in scanner manufacturer, imaging protocol, and diagnostic procedure. We therefore pooled four independent datasets, including 112 healthy controls and 143 patients with MCI, systematically testing multiple brain connections for consistent differences. The largest effects associated with MCI involved the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, striatum, and middle temporal lobe. Compared with controls, patients with MCI exhibited significantly decreased connectivity within the frontal lobe, between frontal and temporal areas, and between regions of the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. Despite the heterogeneity of methods among the four datasets, we identified robust MCI-related connectivity changes that appear to be promising candidate biomarkers for Alzheimers disease."

10.1101/019687,"Delays in gene networks result from the sequential nature of protein assembly. However, it is unclear how models of gene networks that use delays should be modified when considering time-dependent changes in temperature. This is important, as delay is often used in models of genetic oscillators that can be entrained by periodic fluctuations in temperature. Here, we analytically derive the time dependence of delay distributions in response to time-varying temperature changes. We find that the resulting time-varying delay is nonlinearly dependent on parameters of the time-varying temperature such as amplitude and frequency, therefore, applying an Arrhenius scaling may result in erroneous conclusions. We use these results to examine a model of a synthetic gene oscillator with temperature compensation. We show that temperature entrainment follows from the same mechanism that results in temperature compensation. Under a common Arrhenius scaling alone, the frequency of the oscillator is sensitive to changes in the mean temperature but robust to changes in the frequency of a periodically time-varying temperature. When a mechanism for temperature compensation is included in the model, however, we show that the oscillator is entrained by periodically varying temperature even when maintaining insensitivity to the mean temperature."
10.1101/019802,"AimWe studied different species of gooseneck barnacles from the globally distributed rafting genus Lepas to examine whether the most widespread species are true cosmopolitans and to explore the factors influencing the phylogeny and biogeography of these epipelagic rafters.\n\nLocationTemperate and tropical parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indic oceans.\n\nMethodsWe used a phylogenetic approach based on mitochondrial 16S and coI sequences, and the nuclear 18S gene to elucidate patterns of inter- and intra-species divergence. Altogether, five species of Lepas from 18 confined regions of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indic oceans were analyzed.\n\nResultsA combination of nuclear and mitochondrial sequences provided robust phylogenetic signals for biogeographic classification of subgroups in Lepas species. Lepas australis, restricted to cold-temperate waters of the southern hemisphere shows two separate populations in the southern hemisphere (coastal Chile, other circum-Antarctic sampling sites) most probably related to temperature differences in the southern Pacific current systems. A more complex differentiation is seen for the cosmopolitan L. anatifera that thrives in warmer waters. In total, it is differentiated in four regional subgroups (coastal Chile, Oregon, Indopacific in general, Atlantic) and a global group, which might be either an ancient stemgroup, but more probably is an anthropogenic artefact. Separation into subgroups likely reflect geological vicariance effects. For Lepas, these were closure of the Isthmus of Panama, installation of the cool Benguela Current in the later Miocene including its persistence into the Present, Pleistocene current systems in the western Pacific differing from today, and in general lowered Pleistocene temperatures, and finally present-day current systems. The extreme ecological generalists L. anserifera and L. pectinata are not differentated according to available data and might represent true global species. Data for L. testudinata remain ambiguous.\n\nMain conclusionsOur data indicate cryptic speciation in some but not all species of the cosmopolitan epipelagic genus Lepas. Regional distribution of genetically different populations rely on a wealth of in part interacting inherited geological factors and modern traits. Controlling factors differ between species according to their ecospace limits and demonstrate the need for studies on species level to avoid unjustified generalizations. Data indicate that allopatric speciation is the main mode of divergence. True global species, if existent at all, need to be extreme ecological generalists, like Lepas pectinata and L. anserifera."
10.1101/019786,"Sex chromosomes evolve distinctive types of chromatin from a pair of ancestral autosomes that are usually euchromatic. In Drosophila, the dosage-compensated X becomes enriched for hyperactive chromatin in males (mediated by H4K16ac), while the Y chromosome acquires silencing heterochromatin (enriched for H3K9me2/3). Drosophila autosomes are typically mostly euchromatic but the small dot chromosome has evolved a heterochromatin-like milieu (enriched for H3K9me2/3) that permits the normal expression of dot-linked genes, but which is different from typical pericentric heterochromatin. In Drosophila busckii, the dot chromosomes have fused to the ancestral sex chromosomes, creating a pair of  neo-sex chromosomes. Here we collect genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data from D. busckii, to investigate the evolutionary trajectory of sex chromosomes from a largely heterochromatic ancestor. We show that the neo-sex chromosomes formed <1 million years ago, but nearly 60% of neo-Y linked genes have already become non-functional. Expression levels are generally lower for the neo-Y alleles relative to their neo-X homologs, and the silencing heterochromatin mark H3K9me2, but not H3K9me3, is significantly enriched on silenced neo-Y genes. Despite rampant neo-Y degeneration, we find that the neo-X is deficient for the canonical histone modification mark of dosage compensation (H4K16ac), relative to autosomes or the compensated ancestral X chromosome, possibly reflecting constraints imposed on evolving hyperactive chromatin in an originally heterochromatic environment. Yet, neo-X genes are transcriptionally more active in males, relative to females, suggesting the evolution of incipient dosage compensation on the neo-X. Our data show that Y degeneration proceeds quickly after sex chromosomes become established through genomic and epigenetic changes, and are consistent with the idea that the evolution of sex-linked chromatin is influenced by its ancestral configuration.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA is packaged with proteins into two general types of chromatin: the transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressive heterochromatin. Sex chromosomes typically evolve from a pair of euchromatic autosomes. The Y chromosome of Drosophila is gene poor and almost entirely heterochromatic; the X chromosome, in contrast, has evolved a hyperactive euchromatin structure and globally up-regulates its gene expression, to compensate for loss of activity from the homologous genes on the Y chromosome. The evolutionary trajectory along which sex chromosomes evolve such opposite types of chromatin configurations remains unclear, as most sex chromosomes are ancient and no longer contain signatures of their transitions. Here we investigate a pair of unusual young sex chromosomes (termed  neo-Y and  neo-X chromosomes) in D. busckii, which formed through fusions of a largely heterochromatic autosome (the  dot chromosome) to the ancestral sex chromosomes. We show that nearly 60% of the neo-Y genes have already become non-functional within only 1 million years of evolution. Gene expression is lower on the neo-Y than on the neo-X, which is associated with a higher level of binding of a silencing heterochromatin mark. The neo-X, on the other hand, shows no evidence of evolving hyperactive chromatin for dosage compensation. Our results show that the Y chromosome can degenerate quickly, but the tempo and mode of chromatin evolution on the sex chromosomes may be constrained by the ancestral chromatin configuration."
10.1101/019745,"Species delimitation is problematic in many taxa due to the difficulty of evaluating predictions from species delimitation hypotheses, which chiefly relay on subjective interpretations of morphological observations and/or DNA sequence data. This problem is exacerbated in recalcitrant taxa for which genetic resources are scarce and inadequate to resolve questions regarding evolutionary relationships and uniqueness. In this case study we demonstrate the empirical utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) by unambiguously resolving phylogenetic relationships among recalcitrant octocoral taxa with divergences greater than 80 million years. We objectively infer robust species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia, which contains some of the most important ecosystem engineers in the deep-sea, by testing alternative taxonomy-guided or unguided species delimitation hypotheses using the Bayes factors delimitation method (BFD*) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data. We present conclusive evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus Paragorgia and indicating the presence of cryptic species boundaries associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences in divergent taxa cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but depend on taxon-specific factors such as mutation rate, generation time and effective population size. We show that classic morphological taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypothesis. Our results pave the way for addressing further questions in biogeography, species ranges, community ecology, population dynamics, conservation, and evolution in octocorals and other marine taxa."
10.1101/019794,"Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples represent a potentially invaluable resource for transcriptomic-based research into the molecular basis of disease. However, use of FFPE samples in gene expression studies has been limited by technical challenges resulting from degradation of nucleic acids. Here we evaluated gene expression profiles derived from fresh-frozen (FRO) and FFPE mouse liver tissues using two DNA microarray protocols and two whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation methodologies. The ribo-depletion protocol outperformed the other three methods by having the highest correlations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and best overlap of pathways between FRO and FFPE groups. We next tested the effect of sample time in formalin (18 hours or 3 weeks) on gene expression profiles. Hierarchical clustering of the datasets indicated that test article treatment, and not preservation method, was the main driver of gene expression profiles. Meta- and pathway analyses indicated that biological responses were generally consistent for 18-hour and 3-week FFPE samples compared to FRO samples. However, clear erosion of signal intensity with time in formalin was evident, and DEG numbers differed by platform and preservation method. Lastly, we investigated the effect of age in FFPE block on genomic profiles. RNA-seq analysis of 8-, 19-, and 26-year-old control blocks using the ribo-depletion protocol resulted in comparable quality metrics, including expected distributions of mapped reads to exonic, UTR, intronic, and ribosomal fractions of the transcriptome. Overall, our results suggest that FFPE samples are appropriate for use in genomic studies in which frozen samples are not available, and that ribo-depletion RNA-seq is the preferred method for this type of analysis in archival and long-aged FFPE samples.\n\nAuthor contributions\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@124589eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1361ddeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e30065org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f0ed5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176fc83_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL"
10.1101/019760,"Role of microRNAs in gene regulation has been well established. Though the number of genes appear to be equal between human and zebrafish, miRNAs detected in zebrafish ([~]247) is significantly low compared to human ([~]2000; miRBase Release 19). It appears that most of the miRNAs in zebrafish are yet to be discovered. Using next generation sequencing technology, we sequenced small RNAs from brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo of zebrafish. In few tissues (brain, gut, liver) sequencing was done sex specifically. About 16-62% of the sequenced reads mapped to known miRNAs of zebrafish, with the exceptions of ovary (5.7%) and testis (7.8%). We used miRDeep2, the miRNA predication tool, to discover the novel miRNAs using the un-annotated reads that ranged from 7.6 to 23.0%, with exceptions of ovary (51.4%) and testis (55.2%) that had the largest pool of un-annotated reads. The prediction tool identified a total of 459 novel pre-miRNAs. Comparison of miRNA expression data of the tissues showed the presence of tissue and sex specific miRNAs that could serve as biomarkers. The brain and liver had highest number of tissue specific (36) and sex specific (34) miRNAs, respectively. Taken together, we have made a comprehensive approach to identify tissue and sex specific miRNAs from zebrafish. Further, we have discovered 459 novel pre-miRNAs ([~]30% homology to human miRNA) as additional genomic resource for zebrafish. This resource can facilitate further investigations to understand miRNA-mRNA gene regulatory network in zebrafish which will have implications to understand human miRNA function."
10.1101/019836,"O_LIUnderstanding shallow water lakes is important because they are not only subjected to a number of natural and anthropogenic stressors but are also able to switch from clear states with high levels of biodiversity to dominance by suspended sediments, phytoplankton, or floating plants. Such switches are often influenced by high levels of nitrogen deposition, which may reduce the diversity of submerged plant communities, suppressing benthic animal and plant life. Therefore, it is important to predict potential effects of nitrogen on such a change.\nC_LIO_LII modeled competition for light and nutrients between floating and submerged plants under low and high nutrient levels. Both types of plants were randomly chosen in their trait space by varying their average trait values by +/-25%.\nC_LIO_LISurprisingly, I found that submerged plants could perform better under high nitrogen by having substantial growth rates. Further, I found that responsiveness to nitrogen deposition is greater in shallow lakes with low biomass than high biomass. My results suggest that shallow lakes with low productivity may respond strongly to nitrogen deposition. Moreover, albedo may increase in the future over shallow lakes. Thus, future warming over shallow lakes may be higher than current predictions. Earth System Models should allow the trait values of submerged and floating plants to vary when making predictions about future climatic conditions.\nC_LI"
10.1101/019877,"In many eusocial species, queens use pheromones to influence offspring to express worker phenotypes. While evidence suggests that queen pheromones are honest signals of the queens reproductive health, here I show that queens honest signaling can result from ancestral maternal manipulation. I develop a mathematical model to study the coevolution of maternal manipulation, offspring resistance to manipulation, and maternal resource allocation. I assume that (1) maternal manipulation causes offspring to be workers against offsprings interests; (2) offspring can resist at no direct cost, as is thought to be the case with pheromonal manipulation; and (3) the mother chooses how much resource to allocate to fertility and maternal care. In the coevolution of these traits, I find that maternal care decreases, thereby increasing the benefit that offspring obtain from help, which in the long run eliminates selection for resistance. Consequently, ancestral maternal manipulation yields stable eusociality despite costless resistance. Additionally, ancestral manipulation in the long run becomes honest signaling that induces offspring to help. These results indicate that both eusociality and its commonly associated queen honest signaling can be likely to originate from ancestral manipulation."
10.1101/019869,"The Luria-Delbruck experiment is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, demonstrating the randomness of mutations before selection. The distribution of the number of mutants in this experiment has been the subject of intense investigation during the last 70 years. Despite this considerable effort, most of the results have been obtained under the assumption of constant growth rate, which is far from the experimental condition. We derive here the properties of this distribution for arbitrary growth function, for both the deterministic and stochastic growth of the mutants. The derivation we propose is surprisingly simple and versatile, allowing many generalizations to be taken easily into account."
10.1101/019828,"The understanding of the mechanisms that allow the origin of species has shed light on many processes such as speciation, adaptation and extinction, but how to explain the existence of such a huge diversity of species on Earth still remains a mystery. Many theories and evidence have corroborated the processes that allow species to evolve or become extinct. Currently there are different hypotheses but no clear demonstrations of the factors that maintain the species diversity of ecosystems. Those based on competitive principles have been criticized from both theoretical and empirical approaches. Only by studying biodiversity in the context of evolution, natural history and ecology (taking into consideration the avoidance of competition and dispersal abilities, the phenotypic plasticity, the heterogeneous landscape, the facilitation and the endogenosymbiosis) we can understand values and gaps of past theories trying to provide a broader understanding of life on Earth towards a Unified Theory of Biodiversity."
10.1101/019844,"Gene expression is precisely controlled in time and space through the integration of signals that act at gene promoters and gene-distal enhancers. Classically, promoters and enhancers are considered separate classes of regulatory elements, often distinguished by histone modifications. However, recent studies have revealed broad similarities between enhancers and promoters, blurring the distinction: active enhancers often initiate transcription, and some gene promoters have the potential of enhancing transcriptional output of other promoters. Here, we propose a model in which promoters and enhancers are considered a single class of functional element, with a unified architecture for transcription initiation. The context of interacting regulatory elements, and surrounding sequences, determine local transcriptional output as well as the enhancer and promoter activities of individual elements."
10.1101/019901,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \""mutation signatures\"" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\n\nHere we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites.\n\nWe illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5 to the mutated site.\n\nThe overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \""mixed-membership models\"" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.\n\nOur methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/.\n\nAuthor SummarySomatic (non-inherited) mutations are acquired throughout our lives in cells throughout our body. These mutations can be caused, for example, by DNA replication errors or exposure to environmental mutagens such as tobacco smoke. Some of these mutations can lead to cancer.\n\nDifferent cancers, and even different instances of the same cancer, can show different distinctive patterns of somatic mutations. These distinctive patterns have become known as \""mutation signatures\"". For example, C > A mutations are frequent in lung caners whereas C > T and CC > TT mutations are frequent in skin cancers. Each mutation signature may be associated with a specific kind of carcinogen, such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light. Identifying mutation signatures therefore has the potential to identify new carcinogens, and yield new insights into the mechanisms and causes of cancer,\n\nIn this paper, we introduce new statistical tools for tackling this important problem. These tools provide more robust and interpretable mutation signatures compared to previous approaches, as we demonstrate by applying them to large-scale cancer genomic data."
10.1101/019885,"We performed a genome-wide scan for genetic variants that influence multiple human phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 40 traits or diseases, including anthropometric traits (e.g. nose size and male pattern baldness), immune traits (e.g. susceptibility to childhood ear infections and Crohns disease), metabolic phenotypes (e.g. type 2 diabetes and lipid levels), and psychiatric diseases (e.g. schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease). First, we identified 307 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) that influence multiple traits (excluding \""trivial\"" phenotype pairs like type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose). Several loci influence a large number of phenotypes; for example, variants near the blood group gene ABO influence eleven of these traits, including risk of childhood ear infections (rs635634: log-odds ratio = 0.06, P = 1.4 x 10-8) and allergies (log-odds ratio = 0.05, P = 2.5 x 10-8), among others. Similarly, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of these traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-odds ratio = 0.15, P = 2 x 10-12) and Parkinsons disease (log-odds ratio = -0.15, P = 1.6 x 10-7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that share multiple genetic causes in common. For example, genetic variants that delay age of menarche in women also, on average, delay age of voice drop in men, decrease body mass index (BMI), increase adult height, and decrease risk of male pattern baldness. Finally, we identified four pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased BMI causally increases triglyceride levels, and that increased liability to hypothyroidism causally decreases adult height."
10.1101/018523,"Population dynamics is a central component of demography and critical for meta-population management, especially of endangered species. We employed complete individual life records to construct census data for a reintroduced black rhinoceros population over 22 years from its founding and investigated that populations dynamics to inform black rhinoceros meta-population management practice and, more generally, megaherbivore ecology. Akaikes information criterion applied to scalar models of population growth based on the generalized logistic unambiguously selected an exponential growth model (r = 0.102 {+/-} 0.017), indicating a highly successful reintroduction, but yielding no evidence of density dependence. This result is consistent with, but does not confirm, the threshold model of density dependence that has influenced black rhinoceros meta-population management. Our analysis did support previous work contending that the generalized logistic is unreliable when fit to data that do not sample the entire range of possible population sizes. A stage-based matrix model of the exponential population dynamics exhibited mild transient behaviour. We found no evidence of environmental stochasticity, consistent with our previous studies of this population that found no influence of rainfall on demographic parameters. Process noise derived from demographic stochasticity, principally reflected in annual sex-specific recruitment numbers that differed from deterministic predictions of the matrix model. Demographically driven process noise should be assumed to be a component of megaherbivore population dynamics, as these populations are typically relatively small, and should be considered in managed removals and introductions. We suggest that an extended period of exponential growth is common for megaherbivore populations growing from small size and that an increase in age at first reproduction with increasing population size, manifest in the study population, may provide a warning of density feedback prior to detectable slowing of population growth rate for megaherbivores."
10.1101/019851,"In a recent articxle, Nelson-Sathi et al. [NS] report that the origins of Major Archaeal Lineages [MAL] correspond to massive group-specific gene acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria (Nelson-Sathi et al., 2015, Nature 517(7532):77-80). If correct, this would have fundamental implications for the process of diversification in microbes. However, a re-examination of these data and results shows that the methodology used by NS systematically inflates the number of genes acquired at the root of each MAL, and incorrectly assumes bacterial origins for these genes. A re-analysis of their data with appropriate phylogenetic models accounting for the dynamics of gene gain and loss between lineages supports the continuous acquisition of genes over long periods in the evolution of Archaea."
10.1101/019893,"Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) open up new opportunities for targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes. Similar to zinc-finger nucleases, sequence-specific DNA-binding domains can be fused with effector domains like the nucleolytically active part of FokI in order to induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and thereby modify the host genome on a predefined target site via non-homologous end joining. More sophisticated applications of programmable endonucleases involve the use of a DNA repair template facilitating homology-directed repair (HDR) so as to create predefined rather than random DNA sequence modifications. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of editing the barley genome by precisely modifying a defined target DNA sequence resulting in a predicted alteration of gene function. We used gfp-specific TALENs along with a repair template that, via HDR, facilitates conversion of gfp into yfp which is associated with a single amino acid exchange in the gene product. As a result of co-bombardment of leaf epidermis, we detected YFP accumulation in about 3 out of 100 mutated cells. The creation of a functional yfp gene via HDR was unambiguously confirmed by sequencing of the respective genomic site. Predictable genetic modifications comprising only a few genomic base pairs rather than entire genes are of particular practical relevance, because they might not fall under the European regulation of genetically engineered organisms. In addition to the allele conversion accomplished in planta, a readily screenable marker system is introduced that might be useful for optimization approaches in the field of genome editing."
10.1101/019927,"When facing recalcitrant pollutants, soil bacteria exploit noise of catabolic promoters for deploying environmentally beneficial phenotypes such as metabolic bet-hedging an/or division of biochemical labor. While the origin of such noise in terms of upstream promoter-regulator interplay is hardly understood, its dynamics has to be somehow encrypted in the patterns of flow-cytometry data delivered by transcriptional reporter fusions. On this background, we have examined the behaviour of the Pm promoter of the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida and its cognate 3-methylbenzoate-responsive regulator XylS under different conditions by following expression of Pm-GFP fusions in single cells. Using mathematical modeling and computational simulations we elucidated the kinetic properties of the system and use them as a baseline code to interpret the observed fluorescence output in terms of upstream regulator variability. Transcriptional noise was predicted to depend on the intracellular physical distance between the regulator source (where the e.g. XylS is being produced in the cells) and the target promoter. Experiments with engineered bacteria where this distance is either minimized or enlarged proved the effects of proximity on noise patterns as predicted by the model. This approach not only allowed deconvolution of cytometry data into mechanistic information on the gene expression flow. But it also provided a mechanistic basis for selecting a given level of noise in engineered regulatory nodes e.g. in Synthetic Biology constructs."
10.1101/019935,"There is high variability in the level of herbivory between individual plants from the same species with potential effects on population dynamics, community composition, and ecosystem structure and function. This variability can be partly explained by associational effects i.e. the impact of the presence of neighboring plants on the level of herbivory experienced by a focal plant, but it is still unclear how the spatial scale of plant neighborhood modulates foraging choice of herbivores; an inherently spatial process in itself. Using a meta-analysis, we investigated how spatial scale modifies associational effects on the susceptibility to browsing by herbivores with movement capacities similar to deer. From 2496 articles found in literature databases, we selected 46 studies providing a total of 168 differences of means in damage by herbivores or survival to woody plants (mostly) with and without neighboring plants. Spatial scales were reported as distance between plants or as plot size. We estimated the relationships between the effect sizes and spatial scale, type of associational effects and nature of the experiment using meta-analysis mixed models. The strength of associational effects declined with increasing plot size, regardless of the type of associational effects. Associational defences (i.e. decrease in herbivory for focal plants associated with unpalatable neighbors) had stronger magnitude than associational susceptibilities. The high remaining heterogeneity among studies suggests that untested factors modulate associational effects, such as nutritional quality of focal and neighboring plants, density of herbivores, timing of browsing, etc. Associational effects are already considered in multiple restoration contexts worldwide, but a better understanding of these relationships could improve their use in conservation, restoration and forest exploitation when browsing is a concern. This study is the first to investigate spatial patterns of associational effects across species and ecosystems, an issue that is essential to determine differential herbivory damages among plants."

10.1101/019968,"Learning is a fundamental biological adaptation that is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. According to previous research, two conditions are necessary for learning to be adaptive: between-generation environmental variability and within-generation environmental predictability. In this paper, we show that between-generation variability is not necessary, and that instrumental learning can provide a selective advantage in complex environments, where an individual is exposed to a large number of different challenges during its lifespan. We construct an evolutionary model where individuals have a memory with limited storage capacity, and an evolving trait determines the fraction of that memory that should be allocated to innate responses to the environment versus learning these responses. The evolutionarily stable level of learning depends critically on the environmental process, but generally increases with environmental complexity. Overall, our work sheds light on the importance of global structural properties of the environment in shaping the evolution of learning."

This semi-conservative duplex is sequentially treated with {beta}- glucosyltransferase and M.SssI methylase. A glucosyl-5hmCpG in the parental strand inhibits methylation of the mirroring CpG site, and after bisulfite conversion, a thymine in the mirroring strand indicates a 5hmCpG site in the parental strand whereas a cytosine indicates a non-5hmC site.

This manuscript evaluates several popular read-correction tools ability to correct sequence errors commonplace to transcriptome derived Illumina reads.\n\nResultsI evaluated the efficacy of correction of transcriptome derived sequencing reads using using several metrics across a variety of sequencing depths.

10.1101/020115,"Mixed models are an effective statistical method for increasing power and avoiding confounding in genetic association studies. Existing mixed model methods have been designed for \""pooled\"" studies where all individual-level genotype and phenotype data are simultaneously visible to a single analyst. Many studies follow a \""meta-analysis\"" design, wherein a large number of independent cohorts share only summary statistics with a central meta-analysis group, and no one person can view individual-level data for more than a small fraction of the total sample. When using linear regression for GWAS, there is no difference in power between pooled studies and meta-analyses [1]; however, we show that when using mixed models, standard meta-analysis is much less powerful than mixed model association on a pooled study of equal size. We describe a method that allows meta-analyses to capture almost all of the power available to mixed model association on a pooled study without sharing individual-level genotype data. The added computational cost and analytical complexity of this method is minimal, but the increase in power can be large: based on the predictive performance of polygenic scoring reported in [2] and [3], we estimate that the next height and BMI studies could see increases in effective sample size of {approx}15% and {approx}8%, respectively. Last, we describe how a related technique can be used to increase power in sequencing, targeted sequencing and exome array studies.\n\nNote that these techniques are presently only applicable to randomly ascertained studies and will sometimes result in loss of power in ascertained case/control studies. We are developing similar methods for case/control studies, but this is more complicated."
10.1101/019976,"Starch synthesis requires several enzymatic activities including branching enzymes (BEs) responsible for the formation of (1[-&gt;]6) linkages. Distribution and number of these linkages are further controlled by debranching enzymes (DBEs) that cleave some of them, rendering the polyglucan water-insoluble and semi-crystalline. Although the activity of BEs and DBEs is mandatory to sustain normal starch synthesis, the relative importance of each in the establishment of the plant storage polyglucan (i.e. water-insolubility, crystallinity, presence of amylose) is still debated. Here, we have substituted the activity of BEs in Arabidopsis with that of the Escherichia coli glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB). The latter is the BE counterpart in the metabolism of glycogen, a highly branched water-soluble and amorphous storage polyglucan. GlgB was expressed in the be2 be3 double mutant of Arabidopsis that is devoid of BE activity and consequently free of starch. The synthesis of a water-insoluble, partly crystalline, amylose-containing starch-like polyglucan was restored in GlgB-expressing plants, suggesting that BEs origin only have a limited impact on establishing essential characteristics of starch. Moreover, the balance between branching and debranching is crucial for the synthesis of starch, as an excess of branching activity results in the formation of highly branched, water-soluble, poorly crystalline polyglucan."
10.1101/020131,"Motif search is an important step in extracting meaningful patterns from biological data. Since the general problem of motif search is intractable, there is a pressing need to develop efficient exact and approximation algorithms to solve this problem. We design novel algorithms for solving the Edit-distance-based Motif Search (EMS) problem: given two integers l, d and n biological strings, find all strings of length l that appear in each input strings with at most d substitutions, insertions and deletions. These algorithms have been evaluated on several challenging instances. Our algorithm solves a moderately hard instance (11, 3) in a couple of minutes and the next difficult instance (14, 3) in a couple of hours whereas the best previously known algorithm, EMS1, solves (11, 3) in a few hours and does not solve (13, 4) even after 3 days. This significant improvement is due to a novel and provably efficient neighborhood generation technique introduced in this paper. This efficient approach can be used in other edit distance based applications in Bioinformatics, such as k-spectrum based sequence error correction algorithms. We also use a trie based data structure to efficiently store the candidate motifs in the neighbourhood and to output the motifs in a sorted order."
10.1101/020172,"Understanding the transcriptional regulatory code, as well as other types of information encoded within biomolecular sequences, will require learning biophysical models of sequence-function relationships from high-throughput data. Controlling and characterizing the noise in such experiments, however, is notoriously difficult. The unpredictability of such noise creates problems for standard likelihood-based methods in statistical learning, which require that the quantitative form of experimental noise be known precisely. However, when this unpredictability is properly accounted for, important theoretical aspects of statistical learning which remain hidden in standard treatments are revealed. Specifically, one finds a close relationship between the standard inference method, based on likelihood, and an alternative inference method based on mutual information. Here we review and extend this relationship. We also describe its implications for learning sequence-function relationships from real biological data. Finally, we detail an idealized experiment in which these results can be demonstrated analytically."
10.1101/020149,"The paleontological record chronicles numerous episodes of mass extinction that severely culled the Tree of Life. Biologists have long sought to assess the extent to which these events may have impacted particular groups. We present a novel method for detecting mass-extinction events from phylogenies estimated from molecular sequence data. We develop our approach in a Bayesian statistical framework, which enables us to harness prior information on the frequency and magnitude of mass-extinction events. The approach is based on an episodic stochastic-branching process model in which rates of speciation and extinction are constant between rate-shift events. We model three types of events: (1) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (2) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate, and; (3) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each of the events is described by a separate compound Poisson process (CPP) model, where the waiting times between each event are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-type specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events, provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e., below 5%) false discovery rate even in the case of background diversification rate variation. Finally, we provide an empirical application of this approach to conifers, which reveals that this group has experienced two major episodes of mass extinction. This new approach--the CPP on Mass Extinction Times (CoMET) model--provides an effective tool for identifying mass-extinction events from molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes more prosaic temporal variation in diversification rate."
10.1101/020180,"In this study, we sequenced the genome of P. pnomenusa RB38 and reported the finding of a pair of cognate luxI/R homologs which we firstly coined as ppnI, which is found adjacent to a luxR homolog, ppnR. An additional orphan luxR homolog, ppnR2 was also discovered. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that PpnI is a distinct cluster of AHL synthase compared to those of its nearest phylogenetic neighbor, Burkholderia spp. When expressed heterologously and analysed using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, PpnI directs the synthesis of N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C8-HSL). To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of the luxI/R homologs of the genus of Pandoraea."
10.1101/020206,"Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes."
10.1101/020214,"We introduce Pyvolve, a flexible Python module for simulating genetic data along a phylogeny according to continuous-time Markov models of sequence evolution. Pyvolve is easily incorporated into Python bioinformatics pipelines, and it can simulate sequences according most standard models of nucleotide, amino-acid, and codon sequence evolution. All model parameters are fully customizable. Users can additionally specify custom evolutionary models, with custom rate matrices and/or states to evolve. This flexibility makes Pyvolve a convenient framework not only for simulating sequences under a wide variety of conditions, but also for developing and testing new evolutionary models. Moreover, Pyvolve includes several novel sequence simulation features, including a new rate matrix scaling algorithm and branch-length perturbations.

10.1101/020230,"The assembly of large, repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes continues to represent a significant challenge in genomics. While long-read technologies have made the high-quality assembly of small, microbial genomes increasingly feasible, data generation can be prohibitively expensive for larger genomes. Advances in assembly algorithms are thus essential to exploit the characteristics of short and long-read sequencing technologies to consistently and reliably provide high-quality assemblies in a cost-efficient manner. OPERA-LG is a scalable, exact algorithm for the scaffold assembly of large, repeat-rich genomes, with consistent improvement over state-of-the-art programs for scaffold correctness and contiguity. It provides a rigorous framework for scaffolding of repetitive sequences and a systematic approach for combining data from different second-generation (Illumina, Ion Torrent) and third-generation (PacBio, ONT) sequencing technologies. OPERA-LG efficiently scaffolds large genomes with provable scaffold properties, providing an avenue for systematic augmentation and improvement of 1000s of existing draft eukaryotic genome assemblies."
10.1101/020222,"The lack of effective biomarkers for predicting cancer risk in premalignant disease is a major clinical problem. There is a near-limitless list of candidate biomarkers and it remains unclear how best to sample the tissue in space and time. Practical constraints mean that only a few of these candidate biomarker strategies can be evaluated empirically and there is no framework to determine which of the plethora of possibilities is the most promising. Here we have sought to solve this problem by developing a theoretical platform for in silico biomarker development. We construct a simple computational model of carcinogenesis in premalignant disease and use the model to evaluate an extensive list of tissue sampling strategies and different molecular measures of these samples. Our model predicts that: (i) taking more biopsies improves prognostication, but with diminishing returns for each additional biopsy; (ii) longitudinally-collected biopsies provide slightly more prognostic information than a single biopsy collected at the latest possible time-point; (iii) measurements of clonal diversity are more prognostic than measurements of the presence or absence of a particular abnormality and are particularly robust to confounding by tissue sampling; and (iv) the spatial pattern of clonal expansions is a particularly prognostic measure. This study demonstrates how the use of a mechanistic framework provided by computational modelling can diminish empirical constraints on biomarker development."

10.1101/020263,"ObjectiveUrothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder is the fourth most common cancer in males in the United States. In addition to mutations in FGFR3, TP53, AKT1, TSC1, and PTEN genes, mutations in PIK3CA have been also described in urothelial carcinomas, preferentially in low-grade tumors. Mutations in PIK3CA also has been shown to have implications for prognosis, surveillance and therapeutic response. Thus, determining the PIK3CA status in urothelial carcinomas could potentially improved the clinical management of patients with bladder cancer. Herein, we evaluated the presence of PIK3CA mutations in exons 1, 9, and 20 in 21 urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder.\n\nMethodsPatients were treated by radical cystectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Representative tissue blocks (1 for each case) were selected. We used a pinpoint DNA extraction technique from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and mutational analysis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay coupled with sequencing of targeted exons. Patients included 15 men and 6 women, with a median age of 68 years (range, 42 to 76 years), with 3 noninvasive and 18 invasive urothelial carcinomas. Noninvasive carcinomas included 1 case each of low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS). Invasive tumors included 3 pT1, 5 pT2, 6 pT3, and 4 pT4 urothelial carcinomas.\n\nResultsWe did not find mutations in the analyzed exons of the PIK3CA gene, in any of the 21 urothelial carcinomas. The preponderance of invasive high-grade and high-stage tumors could explain the absence of identifiable mutations in our cohort.\n\nConclusionsPIK3CA mutations as prognosti-cators of outcome or predictors of therapeutic response await further evaluation."
10.1101/020297,"Long (>200vbps) non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) can act as a scaffold promoting the interaction of several proteins, RNA and DNA. Some lncRNAs interact with the DNA via a triple helix formation. Triple helices are formed by a single stranded RNA/DNA molecule, which binds to the major groove of a double helix following a canonical code. Recently, sequence analysis methods have been proposed to detect triple helices for a given RNA and DNA sequences. We propose the Triplex Domain Finder (TDF) to detect DNA binding domains in RNA molecules. For a candidate lncRNA and potential target DNA regions, i.e. promoter of genes differentially regulated after the knockdown of the lncRNA, TDF evaluates whether particular RNA regions are likely to form DNA binding domains (DBD). Moreover, the DNA binding sites from the predicted DBDs are used to indicate potential target DNA regions, i.e. genes with high binding site coverage in their promoter. The command line tool provides results on a user friendly and graphical html interface. A case study on FENDRR, an lncRNA known to form triple helices, demonstrates that TDF is able to recover both previously discovered DBDs and DNA binding sites.

10.1101/020289,"The last 20 years have been a remarkable era for biology and medicine. One of the most significant achievements has been the sequencing of the first human genomes, which has laid the foundation for profound insights into human genetics, the intricacies of regulation and development, and the forces of evolution. Incredibly, as we look into the future over the next 20 years, we see the very real potential for sequencing more than one billion genomes, bringing with it even deeper insights into human genetics as well as the genetics of millions of other species on the planet. Realizing this great potential, though, will only be achieved through the integration and development of highly scalable computational and quantitative approaches can keep pace with the rapid improvements to biotechnology. In this perspective, we aim to chart out these future technologies, anticipate the major themes of research, and call out the challenges ahead. One of the largest shifts will be in the training used to prepare the class of 2035 for their highly interdisciplinary world."
10.1101/020313,"Cell-cell intercalation is used in several developmental processes to shape the normal body plan1. There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in pathologies. Here, we use the proto-oncogene Myc to study a process analogous to early phase of tumour expansion: Myc-induced cell competition2-7. Cell competition is a conserved mechanism5,6,8,9 driving the elimination of slow proliferating cells (so called losers) by faster proliferating neighbours (so called winners) through apoptosis10 and is important to prevent developmental malformations and maintain tissue fitness11. Using long term live imaging of Myc-driven competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, we show that the probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact shared with winners. As such, modifying loser/winner interface morphology can modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser clones requires winner/loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a preferential stabilisation of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone compactness over time. Differences in tension are generated by a relative difference of junctional F-actin levels between loser and winner junctions, induced by differential levels of the phosphatidylinositol PIP3. Our results establish the first link between cell-cell intercalation induced by a proto-oncogene and how it promotes invasiveness and destruction of healthy tissues."
10.1101/020271,"New DNA sequencing technologies are allowing researchers to explore the genomes of the millions of natural history specimens collected prior to the molecular era. Yet, we know little about how well specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques work with the degraded DNA typically extracted from museum specimens. Here, we use one type of NGS approach, sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs), to collect data from bird museum specimens as old as 120 years. We targeted approximately 5,000 UCE loci in 27 Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) representing three evolutionary lineages, and we collected an average of 3,749 UCE loci containing 4,460 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite older specimens producing fewer and shorter loci in general, we collected thousands of markers from even the oldest specimens. More sequencing reads per individual helped to boost the number of UCE loci we recovered from older specimens, but more sequencing was not as successful at increasing the length of loci. We detected contamination in some samples and determined contamination was more prevalent in older samples that were subject to less sequencing. For the phylogeny generated from concatenated UCE loci, contamination led to incorrect placement of some individuals. In contrast, a species tree constructed from SNPs called within UCE loci correctly placed individuals into three monophyletic groups, perhaps because of the stricter analytical procedures we used for SNP calling. This study and other recent studies on the genomics of museums specimens have profound implications for natural history collections, where millions of older specimens should now be considered genomic resources."
10.1101/020198,"Rare variant association studies are at a critical inflexion point with the increasing availability of exome-sequencing data. A popular test of association is the sequence kernel association test (SKAT). Weights are embedded within SKAT to reflect the hypothesized contribution of the variants to the trait variance. Correct weighting is expected to boost power, and yet the correct weights are generally unknown. It is therefore important to assess the effect of weight misspecification in SKAT.\n\nWe evaluated the behavior of the score and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) under weight misspecification. Simulation and empirical results revealed that LRT is generally more robust and more powerful than score test in such a circumstance. For instance, when the simulated betas were larger for rarer than for more common variants, (incorrectly) assigning equal weights reduced the power of the LRT by [~] 5%, while the score tests power dropped by [~] 30%.\n\nTo optimize weighting we proposed a data-driven weighting scheme. With this scheme and LRT we detected significant enrichment of rare case mutations (MAF<5%; P-value=7e-04) of a set of constrained genes in the Swedish schizophre-nia case-control cohort with exome-sequencing data.\n\nThe score test is currently preferred for its computational efficiency and power. Indeed, assuming correct specification, in some circumstances the score test is the most powerful test. However, LRT has the compelling qualities of being generally more powerful and more robust to misspecification. This is an important result given that, arguably, misspecified models are likely to be the rule rather than the exception in weighting-based approaches."
10.1101/020305,"BackgroundDrug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains.\n\nResultsThe P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.\n\nConclusionsWe report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains."
10.1101/020347,"A fundamental challenge common to studies of animal movement, behavior, and ecology is the collection of high-quality datasets on spatial positions of animals as they change through space and time. Recent innovations in tracking technology have allowed researchers to collect large and highly accurate datasets on animal spatiotemporal position while vastly decreasing the time and cost of collecting such data. One technique that is of particular relevance to the study of behavioral ecology involves tracking visual tags that can be uniquely identified in separate images or movie frames. These tags can be located within images that are visually complex, making them particularly well suited for longitudinal studies of animal behavior and movement in naturalistic environments. While several software packages have been developed that use computer vision to identify visual tags, these software packages are either (a) not optimized for identification of single tags, which is generally of the most interest for biologist, or (b) suffer from licensing issues, and therefore their use in the study of animal behavior has been limited. Here, we present BEEtag, an open-source, image-based tracking system in Matlab that allows for unique identification of individual animals or anatomical markers. The primary advantages of this system are that it (a) independently identifies animals or marked points in each frame of a video, limiting error propagation, (b) performs well in images with complex background, and (c) is low-cost. To validate the use of this tracking system in animal behavior, we mark and track individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) and recover individual patterns of space use and activity within the hive. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this software package and its application to the study of animal movement, behavior, and ecology."

10.1101/020362,"BackgroundTranscriptional enhancers are generally known to regulate gene transcription from afar. Their activation involves a series of changes in chromatin marks and recruitment of protein factors. These enhancers may also occur inside genes, but how many may be active in human cells and their effects on the regulation of the host gene remains unclear.\n\nResultsWe describe a novel semi-supervised method based on the relative enrichment of chromatin signals between 2 conditions to predict active enhancers. We applied this method to the tumoral K562 and the normal GM12878 cell lines to predict enhancers that are differentially active in one cell type. These predictions show enhancer-like properties according to positional distribution, correlation with gene expression and production of enhancer RNAs. Using this model, we predict 10,365 and 9,777 intragenic active enhancers in K562 and GM12878, respectively, and relate the differential activation of these enhancers to expression and splicing differences of the host genes.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that the activation or silencing of intragenic transcriptional enhancers modulate the regulation of the host gene by means of a local change of the chromatin and the recruitment of enhancer-related factors that may interact with the RNA directly or through the interaction with RNA binding proteins.

10.1101/020370,"In budding yeasts, fermentation in the presence of oxygen evolved around the time of a whole genome duplication (WGD) and is thought to confer dominance in high-sugar environments because ethanol is toxic to many species. While there are many fermentative yeast species, only Saccharomyces cerevisiae consistently dominates wine fermentations. In this study, we use co-culture experiments and intrinsic growth rate assays to examine the relative fitness of non-WGD and WGD yeast species across environments to assess when S. cerevisiaes ability to dominate high-sugar environments arose. We show that S. cerevisiae dominates nearly all other non-WGD and WGD species except for its sibling species S. paradoxus in both grape juice and a high-sugar rich medium. Of the species we tested, S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus have evolved the highest ethanol tolerance and intrinsic growth rate in grape juice. However, the ability of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus to dominate certain species depends on the temperature and the type of high-sugar environment. Our results indicate that dominance of high-sugar environments evolved much more recently than the WGD, most likely just prior to or during the differentiation of Saccharomyces species, and that evolution of multiple traits contributes to S. cerevisiaes ability to dominate wine fermentations."

At titers ranging from 107-108 copies per milliliter, reads to EBOV from two patients with acute hemorrhagic fever and CHIKV from an asymptomatic blood donor were detected within 4 to 10 minutes of data acquisition, while lower titer HCV virus (1x105 copies per milliliter) was detected within 40 minutes. Analysis of mapped nanopore reads alone, despite an average individual error rate of 24% [range 8-49%], permitted identification of the correct viral strain in all 4 isolates, and 90% of the genome of CHIKV was recovered with >98% accuracy. Using nanopore sequencing, metagenomic detection of viral pathogens directly from clinical samples was performed within an unprecedented <6 hours sample-to-answer turnaround time and in a timeframe amenable for actionable clinical and public health diagnostics."
10.1101/020321,"High-dose chemotherapy has long been advocated as a means of controlling drug resistance in infectious diseases but recent empirical and theoretical studies have begun to challenge this view. We show how high-dose chemotherapy engenders opposing evolutionary processes involving the mutational input of resistant strains and their release from ecological competition. Whether such therapy provides the best approach for controlling resistance therefore depends on the relative strengths of these processes. These opposing processes lead to a unimodal relationship between drug pressure and resistance emergence. As a result, the optimal drug dose always lies at either end of the therapeutic window of clinically acceptable concentrations. We illustrate our findings with a simple model that shows how a seemingly minor change in parameter values can alter the outcome from one where high-dose chemotherapy is optimal to one where using the smallest clinically effective dose is best. A review of the available empirical evidence provides broad support for these general conclusions. Our analysis opens up treatment options not currently considered as resistance management strategies, and greatly simplifies the experiments required to determine the drug doses which best retard resistance emergence in patients.\n\nSignificance StatementThe evolution of antimicrobial resistant pathogens threatens much of modern medicine. For over one hundred years, the advice has been to  hit hard, in the belief that high doses of antimicrobials best contain resistance evolution. We argue that nothing in evolutionary theory supports this as a good rule of thumb in the situations that challenge medicine. We show instead that the only generality is to either use the highest tolerable drug dose or the lowest clinically effective dose; that is, one of the two edges of the therapeutic window. This approach suggests treatment options not currently considered, and greatly simplifies the experiments required to identify the dose that best retards resistance evolution."
10.1101/020396,"Abstract\n\nBackgroundWe propose an approach to detection of essential proteins required for cancer cell survival. Gene is considered essential if mutation with high functional impact upon function of encoded protein causes death of cancer cell. We draw an analogy between essential cancer proteins and well-known Abraham Walds work on estimating the plane critical areas using data on survivability of aircraft encountering enemy fire. Wald reasoned that parts hit least on the returned planes are critical and should be protected more. Similarly we propose that genes essential for tumor cell should carry less high-impact mutations in cancer compared to polymorphisms found in normal cells.\n\nResultsWe used data on mutations from the Cancer Genome Atlas and polymorphisms found in healthy humans (from 1000 Genomes Project) to predict 91 protein-coding genes essential for melanoma. These genes were selected according to several criteria including negative selection, expression in melanocytes and decrease in the proportion of high-impact mutations in cancer compared with normal cells.\n\nGene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of essential proteins related to membrane and cell periphery. We speculate that this could be a sign of immune system-driven negative selection of cancer neo-antigens. Another finding is overrepresentation of semaphorin receptors, which can mediate distinctive signaling cascades and are involved in various aspects of tumor development. Cytokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR1 were also identified as cancer essential proteins and this is confirmed by other studies.\n\nConclusionsOverall our goal was to illustrate the idea of detecting proteins whose sequence integrity and functioning is important for cancer cell survival. Hopefully, this prediction of essential cancer proteins may point to new targets for anti-tumor therapies."
10.1101/020339,"Previous Bayesian phylogeographic studies of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) explored the origin and spread of the epidemic from China into Russia, indicating that HPAIV circulated in Russia prior to its detection there in 2005. In this study, we extend this research to explore the evolution and spread of HPAIV within Europe during the 2005-2010 epidemic, using all available sequences of the HA and NA gene regions that were collected in Europe and Russia during the outbreak. We use discrete-trait phylodynamic models within a Bayesian statistical framework to explore the evolution of HPAIV. Our results indicate that the genetic diversity and effective population size of HPAIV peaked between mid-2005 and early 2006, followed by drastic decline in 2007, which coincides with the end of the epidemic in Europe. Our results also suggest that domestic birds were the most likely source of the spread of the virus from Russia into Europe. Additionally, estimates of viral dispersal routes indicate that Russia, Romania, and Germany were key epicenters of these outbreaks. Our study quantifies the dynamics of a major European HPAIV pandemic and substantiates the ability of phylodynamic models to improve molecular surveillance of novel AIVs."
10.1101/020511,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently associated with nosocomial infections, including polymicrobial wound infections and the complex biofilm communities that reside within the cystic fibrosis lung. P. aeruginosa utilizes flagellum-mediated motility to approach, attach to, and spread across a surface using a combination of swimming, swarming and twitching (type IV pili extension and retraction) motility. We report an innovative approach to study the motility of single P. aeruginosa cells in microfluidic channels possessing different structural geometry, all with the flexibility of being able to manipulate stiffness gradients and electric fields to investigate changes in motility in response to specific stimuli. P. aeruginosa cells exhibit restricted motility in reduced microchannel spaces, with preferential migration toward a stiffer region in a rigidness gradient of substrate medium and preferential migration toward a positive electrode in presence of a pulsed or successive electric field. This single-cue environmental study using microfluidic technology lays the groundwork for multi-cue experimentation to more faithfully mimic conditions in vivo, demonstrating just some of the advantages of this technique. This study is designed to examine the interplay between surface rigidity, mechanical, and electrical cues to pave the way for improvements in the design of anti-fouling surfaces for biomedical applications and to identify new ways to inhibit bacterial biofilm growth through motility restriction."

These new viruses are poorly characterised and new approaches are needed predict the host species these viruses pose a risk to. The rhabdoviruses are a diverse family of RNA viruses that includes important pathogens of humans, animals and plants. We have discovered 32 new rhabdoviruses through a combination of our own RNA sequencing of insects and searching public sequence databases. Combining these with previously known sequences we reconstructed the phylogeny of 195 rhabdovirus sequences, and produced the most in depth analysis of the family to date. In most cases we know nothing about the biology of the viruses beyond the host they were identified from, but our dataset provides a powerful phylogenetic approach to predict which are vector-borne viruses and which are specific to vertebrates or arthropods. By reconstructing ancestral and present host states we found that switches between major groups of hosts have occurred rarely during rhabdovirus evolution. This allowed us to propose 76 new likely vector-borne vertebrate viruses among viruses identified from vertebrates or biting insects. Based on currently available data, our analysis suggests it is likely there was a single origin of the known plant viruses and arthropod-borne vertebrate viruses, while vertebrate-specific and arthropod-specific viruses arose at least twice. There are also few transitions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Viruses also cluster together at a finer scale, with closely related viruses tending to be found in closely related hosts. Our data therefore suggest that throughout their evolution, rhabdoviruses have occasionally jumped between distantly related host species before spreading through related hosts in the same environment. This approach offers a way to predict the most probable biology and key traits of newly discovered viruses."
10.1101/020479,"The importance of epistasis - or statistical interactions between genetic variants - to the development of complex disease in humans has long been controversial. Genome-wide association studies of statistical interactions influencing human traits have recently become computationally feasible and have identified many putative interactions. However, several factors that are difficult to address confound the statistical models used to detect interactions and make it unclear whether statistical interactions are evidence for true molecular epistasis. In this study, we investigate whether there is evidence for epistasis regulating gene expression after accounting for technical, statistical, and biological confounding factors that affect interaction studies. We identified 1,119 (FDR=5%) interactions within cis-regulatory regions that regulate gene expression in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, a tightly controlled, largely genetically determined phenotype. Approximately half of these interactions replicated in an independent dataset (363 of 803 tested). We then performed an exhaustive analysis of both known and novel confounders, including ceiling/floor effects, missing genotype combinations, haplotype effects, single variants tagged through linkage disequilibrium, and population stratification. Every replicated interaction could be explained by at least one of these confounders, and replication in independent datasets did not protect against this issue. Assuming the confounding factors provide a more parsimonious explanation for each interaction, we find it unlikely that cis-regulatory interactions contribute strongly to human gene expression. As this calls into question the relevance of interactions for other human phenotypes, the analytic framework used here will be useful for protecting future studies of epistasis against confounding."
10.1101/020354,"Networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons form the basic computational units in the mammalian cortex. Within the dominant paradigm, neurons in such networks encode and process information by asynchronously emitting action potentials. In a recent publication, I argued that unstructured, sparsely connected networks of integrate-and-fire neurons display a transition between two qualitatively different types of asynchronous activity as the synaptic coupling is increased. A comment by Engelken et al (bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/017798) disputes this finding. Here I provide additional evidence for a transition between two qualitatively different types of asynchronous activity and address the criticism raised in the comment. The claims that the original paper is \""factually incorrect\"" and \""conceptually misleading\"" are unsubstantiated and inappropriate."
10.1101/020487,"A true engineering framework for synthetic multicellular systems requires a programmable means of cell-cell communication. Such a communication system would enable complex behaviors, such as pattern formation, division of labor in synthetic microbial communities, and improved modularity in synthetic circuits. However, it remains challenging to build synthetic cellular communication systems in eukaryotes due to a lack of molecular modules that are orthogonal to the host machinery, easy to reconfigure, and scalable. Here, we present a novel cell-to-cell communication system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) based on CRISPR transcription factors and the plant hormone auxin that exhibits several of these features. Specifically, we engineered a sender strain of yeast that converts indole-3-acetamide (IAM) into auxin via the enzyme iaaH from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. To sense auxin and regulate transcription in a receiver strain, we engineered a reconfigurable library of auxin degradable CRISPR transcription factors (ADCTFs). Auxin-induced degradation is achieved through fusion of an auxin sensitive degron (from IAA co-repressors) to the CRISPR TF and co-expression with an auxin F-box protein. Mirroring the tunability of auxin perception in plants, our family of ADCTFs exhibits a broad range of auxin sensitivities. We characterized the kinetics and steady state behavior of the sender and receiver independently, and in co-cultures where both cell types were exposed to IAM. In the presence of IAM, auxin is produced by the sender cell and triggers de-activation of reporter expression in the receiver cell. The result is an orthogonal, rewireable, tunable, and arguably scalable cell-cell communication system for yeast and other eukaryotic cells."
10.1101/020461,"Cancer cells exhibit high rates of aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Aerobic glycolysis can provide energy and glutaminolysis can provide carbon for anaplerosis and reductive carboxylation to citrate. However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Energy can be generated from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) of glucose, anaplerosis can be accomplished using pyruvate carboxylate and citrate can be derived from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the mitochondria OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic glycolysis for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including acetate and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Finally, we show that cancer cell lines commonly used in cancer research have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic glycolysis and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation. Any defect or perturbation reducing the OxPhos capacity will exacerbate this selection."
10.1101/020537,"We present a Bayesian method for characterizing the mating system of populations reproducing through a mixture of self-fertilization and random outcrossing. Our method uses patterns of genetic variation across the genome as a basis for inference about pure hermaphroditism, androdioecy, and gynodioecy. We extend the standard coalescence model to accommodate these mating systems, accounting explicitly for multilocus identity disequilibrium, inbreeding depression, and variation in fertility among mating types. We incorporate the Ewens Sampling Formula (ESF) under the infinite-alleles model of mutation to obtain a novel expression for the likelihood of mating system parameters. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm assigns locus-specific mutation rates, drawn from a common mutation rate distribution that is itself estimated from the data using a Dirichlet Process Prior model. Among the parameters jointly inferred are the population-wide rate of self-fertilization, locus-specific mutation rates, and the number of generations since the most recent outcrossing event for each sampled individual."
10.1101/020552,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a rapidly evolving pathogen that causes chronic infections, so genetic diversity within a single infection can be very high. High-throughput \""deep\"" sequencing can now measure this diversity in unprecedented detail, particularly since it can be performed at different timepoints during an infection, and this offers a potentially powerful way to infer the evolutionary dynamics of the intra-host viral population. However, population genomic inference from HIV sequence data is challenging because of high rates of mutation and recombination, rapid demographic changes, and ongoing selective pressures. In this paper we develop a new method for inference using HIV deep sequencing data using an approach based on importance sampling of ancestral recombination graphs under a multi-locus coalescent model. The approach further extends recent progress in the approximation of so-called conditional sampling distributions, a quantity of key interest when approximating co-alescent likelihoods. The chief novelties of our method are that it is able to infer rates of recombination and mutation, as well as the effective population size, while handling sampling over different timepoints and missing data without extra computational difficulty. We apply our method to a dataset of HIV-1, in which several hundred sequences were obtained from an infected individual at seven timepoints over two years. We find mutation rate and effective population size estimates to be comparable to those produced by the software BEAST. Additionally, our method is able to produce local recombination rate estimates. The software underlying our method, Coalescenator, is freely available."
10.1101/020529,"ABTRACTPolyglutamine (pQ) tracts are abundant in many proteins co-interacting on DNA. The lengths of these pQ tracts can modulate their interaction strengths. However, pQ tracts > 40 residues are pathologically prone to amyloidogenic self-assembly. Here, we assess the extent and consequences of variation in the pQ-encoding opa repeats of Notch (N) in Drosophila melanogaster. We use Sanger sequencing to genotype opa sequences (5-CAX repeats), which have resisted assembly using short sequence reads. While the majority of N sequences pertain to reference opa31 (Q13HQ17) and opa32 (Q13HQ18) allelic classes, several rare alleles encode tracts > 32 residues: opa33a (Q14HQ18), opa33b (Q15HQ17), opa34 (Q16HQ17), opa35a1/opa35a2 (Q13HQ21), opa36 (Q13HQ22), and opa37 (Q13HQ23). Only one rare allele encodes a tract < 31 residues: opa23 (Q13-Q10). This opa23 allele shortens the pQ tract while simultaneously eliminating the interrupting histidine. Homozygotes for the short and long opa alleles have defects in sensory bristle organ specification, abdominal patterning, and embryonic survival. Inbred stocks with wild-type opa31 alleles become more viable when outbred, while an inbred stock with the longer opa35 becomes less viable after outcrossing to different backgrounds. In contrast, an inbred stock with the short opa23 allele is semi-viable in both inbred and outbred genetic backgrounds. This opa23 Notch allele also produces notched wings when recombined out of the X chromosome. Importantly, wa-linked X balancers carry the N allele opa33b and suppress AS-C insufficiency caused by the sc8 inversion. Our results demonstrate significant cryptic variation and epistatic sensitivity for the N locus, and the need for long read genotyping of key repeat variables underlying gene regulatory networks."
10.1101/020545,"BackgroundRNA:DNA hybrids represent a non-canonical nucleic acid structure that has been associated with a range of human diseases and potential transcriptional regulatory functions. Mapping of RNA:DNA hybrids in human cells reveals them to have a number of characteristics that give insights into their functions.\n\nResultsWe find RNA:DNA hybrids to occupy millions of base pairs in the human genome. A directional sequencing approach shows the RNA component of the RNA:DNA hybrid to be purine-rich, indicating a thermodynamic contribution to their in vivo stability. The RNA:DNA hybrids are enriched at loci with decreased DNA methylation and increased DNase hypersensitivity, and within larger domains with characteristics of heterochromatin formation, indicating potential transcriptional regulatory properties. Mass spectrometry studies of chromatin at RNA:DNA hybrids shows the presence of the ILF2 and ILF3 transcription factors, supporting a model of certain transcription factors binding preferentially to the RNA:DNA conformation.\n\nConclusionsOverall, there is little to indicate a dependence for RNA:DNA hybrids forming co-transcriptionally, with results from the ribosomal DNA repeat unit instead supporting the intriguing model of RNA generating these structures in trans. The results of the study indicate heterogeneous functions of these genomic elements and new insights into their formation and stability in vivo."

10.1101/020644,"Some group-living species exhibit social immunity, where the immune system of one individual can protect others in the group from infection. In burying beetles this is part of parental care. Larvae feed on vertebrate carcasses which their parents smear with exudates that inhibit microbial growth. We have sequenced the transcriptome of the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides and identified six genes that encode lysozymes - a type of antimicrobial enzyme that has previously been implicated in social immunity in burying beetles. When females start breeding and producing antimicrobial anal exudates, we found that the expression of one of these genes was increased by [~]1000 times to become one of the most abundant transcripts in the transcriptome. We conclude that we have likely identified a gene for social immunity, and that it was recruited during evolution from a previous function in personal immunity."
10.1101/020602,"Transcription factors (TFs) recognize small DNA sequence motifs directly or through their sequence-dependent structure. While sequence composition and degeneracy are verified to be the defining factors of TF binding specificity, the role of conformational dynamics of the DNA remains poorly understood. With growing evidence from next generation sequencing (NGS) data suggesting the inadequacy of sequence-only models, alternative models for describing the TF binding preferences are required, wherein the conformational dynamics presents an attractive option. Here, we report a novel method (DynaSeq) which accurately predicts DNA-conformational ensembles for genomic targets of TFs. Using DynaSeq we demonstrate how the dynamics of binding sites and their distal flanking regions can be used to elucidate TF-binding patterns for two model systems: cell type-specific binding of STAT3 and chromatin structural specificity of 3 functional TF classes viz. pioneers, settlers and migrants. We find that TF preferences in both these systems can be accurately explained by the conformational dynamics of their binding sites and their distal flanking DNA regions. Conformational dynamics not only distinguishes binding sites from genomic backgrounds in STAT3; it also points to a modular organization of their surrounding regions. Further, the differential binding modes of STAT3-DNA reveal a potential mechanism of cellular specificity. Our model identifies clear signatures to accurately classify pioneer, migrant and settler TF targets from the dynamics of distal flanking regions. This suggests that the chromatin preferences of TFs are significantly influenced by the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the DNA surrounding the TF binding sites."
10.1101/020503,"Natural products have provided humans with antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of chemical discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads. The empirical nature of current genome mining approaches used for natural products research limits the chemical space that is explored. By integration of evolutionary concepts related to emergence of metabolism, we have gained fundamental insights that are translated into an alternative genome mining approach, termed EvoMining. As the founding assumption of EvoMining is the evolution of enzymes, we solved two milestone problems revealing unprecedented conversions. First, we report the biosynthetic gene cluster of the  orphan metabolite leupeptin in Streptomyces roseus. Second, we discover an enzyme involved in formation of an arsenic-carbon bond in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans. This work provides evidence that bacterial chemical repertoire is underexploited, as well as an approach to accelerate the discovery of novel antibiotics from bacterial genomes."
10.1101/020651,"Identifying whether potential causal variants for related diseases are shared can increase understanding of the shared etiology between diseases. Colocalization methods are designed to disentangle shared and distinct causal variants in regions where two diseases show association, but existing methods are limited by assuming independent datasets. We extended existing methods to allow for the shared control design common in GWAS and applied them to four autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes (T1D); rheumatoid arthritis; celiac disease (CEL) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Ninety regions associated with at least one disease. In 22 regions (24%), we identify association to precisely one of our four diseases and can find no published association of any other disease to the same region; some of these may reflect effects mediated by the target of immune attack. Thirty-three regions (37%) were associated with two or more, but in 14 of these there was evidence that causal variants differed between diseases. By leveraging information across datasets, we identified novel disease associations to 12 regions previously associated with one or more of the other three autoimmune disorders. For instance, we link the CEL-associated FASLG region to T1D and identify a single SNP, rs78037977, as a likely causal variant. We also highlight several particularly complex association patterns, including the CD28-CTLA4-ICOS region, in which it appears that three distinct causal variants associate with three diseases in three different patterns. Our results underscore the complexity in genetic variation underlying related but distinct autoimmune diseases and help to approach its dissection."
10.1101/020586,"Critics of significance testing claim that this statistical framework promotes discrepancies by using arbitrary thresholds () to impose reject/accept dichotomies on continuous data, which is not reflective of the biological reality of quantitative phenotypes. Here we explore this idea and evaluate an alternative approach, demonstrating the potential for meta-analysis and related estimation methods to resolve discordance generated by the use of traditional significance tests. We selected a set of behavioral studies proposing differing models of the physiological basis of Drosophila olfactory memory and used systematic review and meta-analysis approaches to define the true role of lobular specialization within the brain. The mainstream view is that each of the three lobes of the Drosophila mushroom body play specialized roles in short-term aversive olfactory memory [1-5], but a number of studies have made divergent conclusions based on their discordant experimental findings [6-8]. Multivariate meta-regression models revealed that short-term memory lobular specialization is not in fact supported by the data, and identified the cellular extent of a transgenic driver as the major predictor of its effect on short-term memory. Our findings demonstrate that meta-analysis, meta-regression, hierarchical models and estimation methods in general can be successfully harnessed to identify knowledge gaps, synthesize divergent results, accommodate heterogeneous experimental design and quantify genetic mechanisms."
10.1101/020594,"A central goal of synthetic biology is to design sophisticated synthetic cellular circuits that can perform complex computations and information processing tasks in response to specific inputs. The tremendous advances in our ability to understand and manipulate cellular information processing networks raises several fundamental physics questions: How do the molecular components of cellular circuits exploit energy consumption to improve information processing? Can one utilize ideas from thermodynamics to improve the design of synthetic cellular circuits and modules? Here, we summarize recent theoretical work addressing these questions. Energy consumption in cellular circuits serves five basic purposes: (1) increasing specificity, (2) manipulating dynamics, (3) reducing variability, (4) amplifying signal, and (5) erasing memory. We demonstrate these ideas using several simple examples and discuss the implications of these theoretical ideas for the emerging field of synthetic biology. We conclude by discussing how it may be possible to overcome these limitations using \""post-translational\"" synthetic biology that exploits reversible protein modification."
10.1101/020610,"A major limitation in the analysis of genetic marker data from polyploid organisms is non-Mendelian segregation, particularly when a single marker yields allelic signals from multiple, independently segregating loci (isoloci). However, with markers such as microsatellites that detect more than two alleles, it is sometimes possible to deduce which alleles belong to which isoloci. Here we describe a novel mathematical property of codominant marker data when it is recoded as binary (presence/absence) allelic variables: under random mating in an infinite population, two allelic variables will be negatively correlated if they belong to the same locus, but uncorrelated if they belong to different loci. We present an algorithm to take advantage of this mathematical property, sorting alleles into isoloci based on correlations, then refining the allele assignments after checking for consistency with individual genotypes. We demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data, as well as a real microsatellite dataset from a natural population of octoploid white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Our methodology is implemented in the R package O_SCPLOWPOLYSATC_SCPLOW version 1.5."
10.1101/020677,"Cellular reprogramming, the conversion of one cell type to another, has fundamentally transformed our conception of cell types. Cellular reprogramming induces global changes in gene expression involving hundreds of transcription factors and thousands of genes and understanding how cells globally alter their gene expression profile during reprogramming is an open problem. Here we reanalyze time-series data on cellular reprogramming from differentiated cell types to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and show that gene expression dynamics during reprogramming follow a simple one-dimensional reaction coordinate. This reaction coordinate is independent of both the time it takes to reach the iPSC state as well as the details of experimental protocol used. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that such a reaction coordinate emerges naturally from epigenetic landscape models of cell identity where cellular reprogramming is viewed as a \""barrier-crossing\"" between the starting and ending cell fates. The model also provides gene-level insight into reprogramming dynamics and resolves a debate in the stem cell field about the different phases of reprogramming dynamics. Overall, our analysis and model suggest that gene expression dynamics during reprogramming follow a canonical trajectory consistent with the idea of an \"" optimal path\"" in gene expression space for reprogramming."

Diazepam, 5-HT1A receptor gene knockout and overexpression, SERT gene knockout and overexpression, pain, restraint, social isolation, corticotropin-releasing hormone and Crhr1 were selected for review. Eight interventions had statistically significant effects on rodent anxiety, while Htr1a overexpression and Crh knockout did not. Evidence for publication bias was found in the diazepam, Htt knockout, and social isolation literatures.

10.1101/020735,"The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed between two experimental conditions. Here, we present a discrete, distributional method for differential gene expression (D3E), a novel algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use synthetic data to evaluate D3E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since D3E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D3E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression."
10.1101/020743,"Long distance migration is a widespread process evolved independently in several animal groups in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Many factors contribute to the migration process and of primary importance are intra-specific competition and seasonality in the resource distribution. Adaptive migration in direction of increasing fitness should leads to the ideal free distribution (IFD) which is the evolutionary stable strategy of the habitat selection game. We introduce a migration game which focuses on migrating dynamics that lead to the IFD for age-structured populations in time varying environments where dispersal is costly. The model assumes a network of habitats and predicts migration dynamics between these habitats and the corresponding population distribution. When applied to Atlantic bluefin tunas it predicts their migration routes and their seasonal distribution. The largest biomass is located in the spawning areas which have also the largest diversity in the age-structure. Distant feeding areas are occupied on a seasonal base and often by larger individuals, in agreement with empirical observation. Moreover we show that only a selected number of migratory routes emerge as those effectively used by tunas."

Since this primordial RNA also must have developed enzyme functionalities, in this work we examine the responses of two simple ribozymes to a THP periodic drive, using experimental rate and thermochemical data in a dynamical model for the coupled, self-consistent evolution of all reactants and intermediates. The resulting time traces show that ribozyme performance can be enhanced under pH cycling, and that thermal cycling may have been necessary to achieve large performance gains. We discuss three important ways in which the dynamic hydrogen peroxide medium may have acted as an agent for development of the RNA world towards a cellular world: proton gradients, resolution of the ribozyme versus replication paradox, and vesicle formation."
10.1101/020784,"MotivationAn important property of a valid method for testing for differential expression is that the false positive rate should at least roughly correspond to the p-value cutoff, so that if 10,000 genes are tested at a p-value cutoff of 10-4, and if all the null hypotheses are true, then there should be only about 1 gene declared to be significantly differentially expressed. We tested this by resampling from existing RNA-Seq data sets and also by matched negative binomial simulations.\n\nResultsMethods we examined, which rely strongly on a negative binomial model, such as edgeR, DESeq, and DESeq2, show large numbers of false positives in both the resampled real-data case and in the simulated negative binomial case. This also occurs with a negative binomial generalized linear model function in R. Methods that use only the variance function, such as limma-voom, do not show excessive false positives, as is also the case with a variance stabilizing transformation followed by linear model analysis with limma. The excess false positives are likely caused by apparently small biases in estimation of negative binomial dispersion and, perhaps surprisingly, occur mostly when the mean and/or the dispersion is high, rather than for low-count genes.\n\nContactdmrocke@ucdavis.edu, lruan@ucdavis.edu, yilzhang@ucdavis.edu, gt4636b@gatech.edu, bpdur-bin@ucdavis.edu, saviran@ucdavis.edu.\n\nSupplementary InformationThe computational tools developed for this study are freely available via our website http://dmrocke.ucdavis.edu/software.html.

10.1101/020792,"BackgroundReconstructing phylogenies through Bayesian methods has many benefits, which include providing a mathematically sound framework, providing realistic estimates of uncertainty and being able to incorporate different sources of information based on formal principles. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are popular for interpreting nucleotide sequence data, however for such studies one needs to specify a site model and associated substitution model. Often, the parameters of the site model is of no interest and an ad-hoc or additional likelihood based analysis is used to select a single site model.\n\nResultsbModelTest allows for a Bayesian approach to inferring and marginalizing site models in a phylogenetic analysis. It is based on trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that allow switching between substitution models as well as estimating the posterior probability for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity a proportion of invariable sites and unequal base frequencies. The model can be used with the full set of time-reversible models on nucleotides, but we also introduce and demonstrate the use of two subsets of time-reversible substitution models.\n\nConclusionWith the new method the site model can be inferred (and marginalized) during the MCMC analysis and does not need to be pre-determined, as is now often the case in practice, by likelihood-based methods. The method is implemented in the bModelTest package of the popular BEAST 2 software, which is open source, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License and allows joint site model and tree inference under a wide range of models."
10.1101/020800,"DNA sampled from the environment (eDNA) is becoming a game changer for uncovering biodiversity patterns. By combining a conceptual model and empirical data, we test whether eDNA transported in river networks can be used as an integrative way to assess eukaryotic biodiversity for broad spatial scales and across the land-water interface. Using an eDNA metabarcode approach we detected 296 families of eukaryotes, spanning 19 phyla across the catchment of a river. We show for a subset of these families that eDNA samples overcome spatial autocorrelation biases associated with classical community assessments by integrating biodiversity information over space. Additionally, we demonstrate that many terrestrial species can be detected; thus revealing that eDNA in river-water also incorporates biodiversity information across terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Environmental DNA transported in river networks offers a novel and spatially integrated way to assess total biodiversity for whole landscapes and will transform biodiversity data acquisition in ecology.\n\n\""Eventually, all things merge into one, 32 and a river runs through it.\"" -- Norman Maclean"
10.1101/020685,"MotivationIdentification of biochemical processes that drive the transformation of a totipotent cell into various cell types is essential to our understanding of living systems. This complex machinery determines how tissues differ in terms of their anatomy, physiology, morphology, and, more importantly, how various cellular control mechanisms contribute to the observed similarities/ differences. Tissue-selective genes orchestrate various aspects of cellular machinery in different tissues, and are known to be implicated in a number of tissue-specific pathologies.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel statistical approach that identifies and removes the effect of universally expressed genes in groups of tissues. This allows us to better characterize tissue similarities, as well as to identify tissue-selective genes. We use our method to construct a reliable hierarchy of tissue similarities. The groupings of tissues in this hierarchy are used to specify successively refined priors for identifying tissue-selective functions and their corresponding genes in the reduced subspace. We show that our refinement process enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in the identification of markers. Using case studies of immune cells and brain tissues, we show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of coverage and reliability of the predicted tissue-selective genes.\n\nConclusionsOur statistical approach provides a general framework for enhancing the sensitivity of marker detection methods, which can be used in conjunction with other techniques. Even in cases where the number of available expression datasets is limited, we show that our marker detection method outperforms existing techniques. We present detailed validation on immune cells and brain tissues in this paper. Our approach can be applied to construct similar datasets of other human tissues as well, for identifying tissue-specific genes. We demonstrate how these tissue-selective genes enhance our understanding of differentiating biochemical features of brain tissues, shed light on how tissue-selective pathologies progress, and help us identify specific biomarkers and targets for future interventions."
10.1101/020826,"Polyglutamine (pQ) tracts are abundant in many proteins co-interacting on DNA. The lengths of these pQ tracts can modulate their interaction strengths. However, pQ tracts > 40 residues are pathologically prone to amyloidogenic self-assembly. Here, we assess the extent and consequences of variation in the pQ-encoding opa repeats of Notch (N) in Drosophila melanogaster. We use Sanger sequencing to genotype opa sequences (50-CAX repeats), which have resisted assembly using short sequence reads. While the majority of N sequences pertain to reference opa31 (Q13HQ17) and opa32 (Q13HQ18) allelic classes, several rare alleles encode tracts > 32 residues: opa33a (Q14HQ18), opa33b (Q15HQ17), opa34 (Q16HQ17), opa35a1/opa35a2 (Q13HQ21), opa36 (Q13HQ22), and opa37 (Q13HQ23). Only one rare allele encodes a tract < 31 residues: opa23 (Q13-Q10). This opa23 allele shortens the pQ tract while simultaneously eliminating the interrupting histidine. Homozygotes for the short and long opa alleles have defects in sensory bristle organ specification, abdominal patterning, and embryonic survival. Inbred stocks with wild-type opa31 alleles become more viable when outbred, while an inbred stock with the longer opa35 becomes less viable after outcrossing to different backgrounds. In contrast, an inbred stock with the short opa23 allele is semi-viable in both inbred and outbred genetic backgrounds. This opa23 Notch allele also produces notched wings when recombined out of the X chromosome. Importantly, wa-linked X balancers carry the N allele opa33b and suppress AS-C insufficiency caused by the sc8 inversion. Our results demonstrate potent pQ variation and epistatic sensitivity for the N locus, and the need for long read genotyping of key repeat variables underlying gene regulatory networks."
10.1101/020834,"Recombination is a process that unlinks neighbouring loci allowing for independent evolutionary trajectories within genomes of many organisms. If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently. Recombination in MERS-CoV implies frequent co-infection with distinct lineages of MERS-CoV, probably in camels given the current understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology."
10.1101/020818,"The relatively recent development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques has revealed a wealth of novel sequences found in very low abundance: the rare biosphere. Today, most studies of diversity of microorganisms are carried out almost exclusively with HTS techniques. However, culturing seems indispensable for diversity studies especially if the aim is exploring the rare biosphere. We have carried out a deep (1 million sequences per sample) pyrosequencing analysis of two marine bacterial samples and isolated a culture collection from one of them. We have shown that the collectors curves of the pyrosequencing data were close to reaching an asymptote. We have estimated the total richness of the samples and the sequencing effort necessary to obtain the total estimated richness experimentally. Comparing the pyrosequencing data and the isolates sequences we have found that isolation retrieves some of the rarest taxa and that the composition of rare taxa follows an annual succession. We have shown that increasing the number of tags sequenced would slowly uncover the isolated bacteria. However, even if the whole bacterial diversity was found by increasing the sampling depth, culturing would still be essential for the study of marine bacterial communities, especially if the target is the rare biosphere."
10.1101/020859,"Novel methods for the sequencing of single-cell DNA offer tremendous opportunities. However, many techniques are still in their infancy and a major obstacle is given by sample contamination with foreign DNA. In this contribution, we present a pipeline that allows for fast, automated detection of contaminated samples by the use of modern machine learning methods. First, a vectorial representation of the genomic data is obtained using oligonucleotide signatures. Using non-linear subspace projections, data is transformed to be suitable for automatic clustering. This allows for the detection of one vs. more genomes (clusters) in a sample. As clustering is an ill-posed problem, the pipeline relies on a thorough choice of all involved methods and parameters. We give an overview of the problem and evaluate techniques suitable for this task."
10.1101/020842,"Single-cell transcriptomic profiling enables the unprecedented interrogation of gene expression heterogeneity in rare cell populations that would otherwise be obscured in bulk RNA sequencing experiments. The stochastic nature of transcription is revealed in the bimodality of single-cell transcriptomic data, a feature shared across single-cell expression platforms. There is, however, a paucity of computational tools that take advantage of this unique characteristic. We present a new methodology to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data that models this bimodality within a coherent generalized linear modeling framework. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model that allows one to characterize biological changes in the proportions of cells that are expressing each gene, and in the positive mean expression level of that gene. We introduce the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes turned on in a cell, and show how it can be used to simultaneously adjust for technical variation and so-called \""extrinsic noise\"" at the single-cell level without the use of control genes. Our model permits direct inference on statistics formed by collections of genes, facilitating gene set enrichment analysis. The residuals defined by such models can be manipulated to interrogate cellular heterogeneity and gene-gene correlation across cells and conditions, providing insights into the temporal evolution of networks of co-expressed genes at the single-cell level. Using two single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including newly generated data from Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells, we show how model residuals can be used to identify significant changes across biologically relevant gene sets that are missed by other methods and characterize cellular heterogeneity in response to stimulation."
10.1101/020867,"Proteomics is poised to play critical roles in clinical research. However, due to limited coverage and high noise, integration with powerful analysis algorithms is necessary. In particular, network-based algorithms can improve selection of reproducible features in spite of incomplete proteome coverage, technical inconsistency or high inter-sample variability. We define analytical reliability on three benchmarks --- precision/recall rates, feature-selection stability and cross-validation accuracy. Using these, we demonstrate the insufficiencies of commonly used Students t-test and Hypergeometric enrichment. Given advances in sample sizes, quantitation accuracy and coverage, we are now able to introduce and evaluate Ranked-Based Network Approaches (RBNAs) for the first time in proteomics. These include SNET (SubNETwork), FSNET (FuzzySNET), PFSNET (PairedFSNET). We also introduce for the first time, PPFSNET(samplePairedPFSNET), which is a paired-sample variant of PFSNET. RBNAs (particularly PFSNET and PPFSNET) excelled on all three benchmarks and can make consistent and reproducible predictions even in the small-sample size scenario (n=4). Given these qualities, RBNAs represent an important advancement in network biology, and is expected to see practical usage, particularly in clinical biomarker and drug target prediction."
10.1101/020875,"Cancer genome sequencing studies have identified cancer-driver genes from the increased accumulation of protein-altering mutations. However, the positional distributions of coding mutations, and the 79% of somatic variants in exome data that do not alter protein sequence or RNA splicing, remain largely unstudied. We employed density-based clustering methods on ~4,700 exomes from 21 tumor types to detect variably-sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs reveal recurrent alterations across a diverse spectrum of coding and non-coding elements, including microRNAs, transcription factor binding sites, and untranslated regions that are individually mutated in up to ~15% of samples in specific cancer types. SMRs often associated with changes in gene expression and signaling. Mapping SMRs to protein structures revealed spatial clustering of somatic mutations at known and novel cancer-driver domains and molecular interfaces. Mutation frequencies in SMRs demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially mutated among tumor types. The functional diversity of SMRs underscores both the varied mechanisms of oncogenic misregulation and the advantage of unbiased driver identification."
10.1101/020883,"The striatum is an input structure of the basal ganglia implicated in several time-dependent functions including reinforcement learning, decision making, and interval timing. To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects' judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals' duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time."
10.1101/020966,"BackgroundGenome assembly remains an unsolved problem. Assembly projects face a range of hurdles that confound assembly. Thus a variety of tools and approaches are needed to improve draft genomes.\n\nResultsWe used a custom assembly workflow to optimize consensus genome map assembly, resulting in an assembly equal to the estimated length of the Tribolium castaneum genome and with an N50 of more than 1 Mb. We used this map for super scaffolding the T. castaneum sequence assembly, more than tripling its N50 with the program Stitch.\n\nConclusionsIn this article we present software that leverages consensus genome maps assembled from extremely long single molecule maps to increase the contiguity of sequence assemblies. We report the results of applying these tools to validate and improve a 7x Sanger draft of the T. castaneum genome."
10.1101/020974,"We surveyed gene expression in six tissues in an F2 intercross between mouse strains C57BL/6J (abbreviated B6) and BTBR T+ tf /J (abbreviated BTBR) made genetically obese with the Leptin(ob) mutation. We identified a number of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) affecting the expression of numerous genes distal to the locus, called trans-eQTL hotspots. Some of these trans-eQTL hotspots showed effects in multiple tissues, whereas some were specific to a single tissue. An unusually large number of transcripts (7% of genes) mapped in trans to a hotspot on chromosome 6, specifically in pancreatic islets. By considering the first two principal components of the expression of genes mapping to this region, we were able to convert the multivariate phenotype into a simple Mendelian trait. Fine-mapping the locus by traditional methods reduced the QTL interval to a 298 kb region containing only three genes, including Slco1a6, one member of a large family of organic anion transporters. Direct genomic sequencing of all Slco1a6 exons identified a non-synonymous coding SNP that converts a highly conserved proline residue at amino acid position 564 to serine. Molecular modeling suggests that Pro564 faces an aqueous pore within this 12-transmembrane domain-spanning protein. When transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells, BTBR OATP1A6-mediated cellular uptake of the bile acid taurocholic acid (TCA) was enhanced compared to B6 OATP1A6. Our results suggest that genetic variation in Slco1a6 leads to altered transport of TCA (and potentially other bile acids) by pancreatic islets, resulting in broad gene regulation."
10.1101/020933,"Our method for \""Time to most recent common ancestor\"" TMRCA of genetic trees for the first time deals with natural selection by apriori mathematics and not as a random factor. Bioprocesses such as \""kin selection\"" generate a few overrepresented \""singular lineages\"" while almost all other lineages terminate. This non-uniform branching gives greatly exaggerated TMRCA with current methods. Thus we introduce an inhomogenous stochastic process which will detect singular lineages by asymmetries, whose \""reduction\"" then gives true TMRCA. Reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. This gives a new phylogenetic method for computing mutation rates, with results similar to \""pedigree\"" (meiosis) data. Despite these low rates, reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. We establish accuracy by a comparison across a wide range of time, indeed this is only y-clock giving consistent results for 500-15,000 ybp. In particular we show that the dominant European y-haplotypes R1a1a & R1b1a2, expand from c3700BC, not reaching Anatolia before c3300BC. This contradicts current clocks dating R1b1a2 to either the Neolithic Near East or Paleo-Europe. However our dates match R1a1a & R1b1a2 found in Yamnaya cemetaries of c3300BC by Svante Paabo et al, together proving R1a1a & R1b1a2 originates in the Russian Steppes."
10.1101/020909,"Some diseases are caused by genetic loci with a high rate of change, and heritability in complex traits is likely to be partially caused by variation at these loci. These hypermutable elements, such as tandem repeats, change at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than the rates at which most single nucleotides mutate. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are currently the primary focus of genetic studies of human disease. Here we quantify the degree to which SNPs are correlated with hypermutable loci by examining a range of mutation rates. We use established population genetics theory to relate mutation rates to recombination rates and compare the theoretical predictions to simulations. Both simulations and theory agree that, at the highest mutation rates, almost all correlation is lost between a hypermutable locus and surrounding SNPs. The theoretical predictions break down as the mutation rate increases, and consequently differ widely from the simulated results. The simulation results suggest that some correlation remains between SNPs and hypermutable loci when mutation rates are on the lower end of the mutation spectrum. Consequently, in some cases SNPs can tag variation caused by some hypermutable loci. We also examine the linkage between SNPs and other SNPs and uncover ways in which the linkage disequilibrium of rare SNPs differs from that of hypermutable loci."
10.1101/020891,"Bacteria are central to human health and disease, but the tools available for modulating and editing bacterial communities are limited. New technologies for tuning microbial populations would facilitate the targeted manipulation of the human microbiome and treatment of bacterial infections. For example, antibiotics are often broad spectrum in nature and cannot be used to accurately manipulate bacterial communities. Bacteriophages can provide highly specific targeting of bacteria, but relying solely on natural phage isolation strategies to assemble well-defined and uniform phage cocktails that are amenable to engineering can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Here, we present a synthetic-biology strategy to modulate phage host ranges by manipulating phage genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this technology to swap multiple modular phage tail components and demonstrated that Escherichia coli phage scaffolds can be redirected to target pathogenic Yersinia and Klebsiella bacteria, and conversely, Klebsiella phage scaffolds can be redirected to target E. coli. The synthetic phages achieved multiple orders-of-magnitude killing of their new target bacteria and were used to selectively remove specific bacteria from multi-species bacterial communities. We envision that this approach will accelerate the study of phage biology, facilitate the tuning of phage host ranges, and enable new tools for microbiome engineering and the treatment of infectious diseases."
10.1101/020990,"Eukaryotic cells are defined by compartments through which the trafficking of macromolecules is mediated by large complexes, such as the nuclear pore, transport vesicles and intraflagellar transport. The assembly and maintenance of these complexes is facilitated by endomembrane coatomers, long suspected to be divergently related on the basis of structural and more recently phylogenomic analysis. By performing supervised walks in sequence space across coatomer superfamilies, we uncover subtle sequence patterns that have remained elusive to date, ultimately unifying eukaryotic coatomers by divergent evolution. The conserved residues shared by 3,502 endomembrane coatomer components are mapped onto the solenoid superhelix of nucleoporin and COPII protein structures, thus determining the invariant elements of coatomer architecture. This ancient structural motif can be considered as a universal signature connecting eukaryotic coatomers involved in multiple cellular processes across cell physiology and human disease."
10.1101/021048,"One of surprising recent discoveries in biology is that the gene and protein expression profiles in cells with identical genetic and environmental makeup can exhibit large variability. The nature and the significance of this variability had been posed as one of the current fundamental questions of biology. In this letter, we argue that the observed variability in cellular gene and protein expression can be understood as an outcome of homeostatic regulation mechanisms controlling the gene and protein expression profiles."
10.1101/021030,"Little is known about the mechanisms that enable organisms to cope with unpredictable environments. To address this issue, we used replicate populations of Escherichia coli selected under complex, randomly changing environments. Under four novel stresses that had no known correlation with the selection environments, individual cells of the selected populations had significantly lower lag and greater yield compared to the controls. More importantly, there were no outliers in terms of growth, thus ruling out the evolution of population-based resistance. We also assayed the standing phenotypic variation of the selected populations, in terms of their growth on 94 different substrates. Contrary to expectations, there was no increase in the standing variation of the selected populations, nor was there any significant divergence from the ancestors. This suggested that the greater fitness in novel environments is brought about by selection at the level of the individuals, which restricts the suite of traits that can potentially evolve through this mechanism. Given that day-to-day climatic variability of the world is rising, these results have potential public health implications. Our results also underline the need for a very different kind of theoretical approach to study the effects of fluctuating environments."
10.1101/020776,"The rate at which human genomes mutate is a central biological parameter that has many implications for our ability to understand demographic and evolutionary phenomena. We present a method for inferring mutation and gene conversion rates using the number of sequence differences observed in identical-by-descent (IBD) segments together with a reconstructed model of recent population size history. This approach is robust to, and can quantify, the presence of substantial genotyping error, as validated in coalescent simulations. We applied the method to 498 trio-phased Dutch individuals from the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) project, sequenced at an average depth of 13x. We infer a point mutation rate of 1.66 {+/-} 0.04 x 10-8 per base per generation, and a rate of 1.26 {+/-} 0.06 x 10-9 for < 20 bp indels. Our estimated average genome-wide mutation rate is higher than most pedigree-based estimates reported thus far, but lower than estimates obtained using substitution rates across primates. By quantifying how estimates vary as a function of allele frequency, we infer the probability that a site is involved in non-crossover gene conversion as 5.99 {+/-} 0.69 x 10-6, consistent with recent reports. We find that recombination does not have observable mutagenic effects after gene conversion is accounted for, and that local gene conversion rates reflect recombination rates. We detect a strong enrichment for recent deleterious variation among mismatching variants found within IBD regions, and observe summary statistics of local IBD sharing to closely match previously proposed metrics of background selection, but find no significant effects of selection on our estimates of mutation rate. We detect no evidence for strong variation of mutation rates in a number of genomic annotations obtained from several recent studies."
10.1101/021006,"In the construction of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) from two divergent inbred parents certain genotype (or epigenotype) combinations may be functionally \""incompatible\"" when brought together in the genomes of the progeny, thus resulting in sterility or lower fertility. Natural selection against these epistatic combinations during inbreeding can change haplotype frequencies and distort linkage disequilibrium (LD) relations between loci within and across chromosomes. These LD distortions have received increased experimental attention, because they point to genomic regions that may drive Dobzhansky-Muller-type of reproductive isolation and, ultimately, speciation in the wild. Here we study the selection signatures of two-locus epistatic incompatibility models and quantify their impact on the genetic composition of the genomes of 2-way RILs obtained by selfing. We also consider the biases introduced by breeders when trying to counteract the loss of lines by selectively propagating only viable seeds. Building on our theoretical results, we develop model-based maximum likelihood (ML) tests which can be employed in pairwise genome scans for incompatibility loci using multi-locus genotype data. We illustrate this ML approach in the context of two published A.thaliana RIL panels. Our work lays the theoretical foundation for studying more complex systems such as RILs obtained by sibling mating and/or from multi-parental crosses."
10.1101/021071,"The relationship between functional brain activity and gene expression has not been fully explored in the human brain. Here, we identify significant correlations between gene expression in the brain and functional activity by comparing fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) from two independent human fMRI resting state datasets to regional cortical gene expression from a newly generated RNA-seq dataset and two additional gene expression datasets to obtain robust and reproducible correlations. We find significantly more genes correlated with fALFF than expected by chance, and identify specific genes correlated with the imaging signals in multiple expression datasets in the default mode network. Together, these data support a population-level relationship between regional steady state brain gene expression and resting state brain activity.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIGene expression is correlated with resting state activity in human brain.\nC_LIO_LISpecific genes are correlated with activity in the default mode network.\nC_LIO_LIActivity-correlated genes are enriched in neurons.\nC_LIO_LIRegionally-patterned gene expression is enriched for activity-correlated genes.\nC_LI"
10.1101/020917,CTFFIND is a widely-used program for the estimation of objective lens defocus parameters from transmission electron micrographs. Defocus parameters are estimated by fitting a model of the microscopes contrast transfer function (CTF) to an images amplitude spectrum. Here we describe modifications to the algorithm which make it significantly faster and more suitable for use with images collected using modern technologies such as dose fractionation and phase plates. We show that this new version preserves the accuracy of the original algorithm while allowing for higher throughput. We also describe a measure of the quality of the fit as a function of spatial frequency and suggest this can be used to define the highest resolution at which CTF oscillations were successfully modeled.
10.1101/021055,"Intrinsic covariation of brain activity has been studied across many levels of brain organization. Between visual areas, neuronal activity covaries primarily among portions with similar retinotopic selectivity. We hypothesized that spontaneous inter-areal co-activation is subserved by neuronal synchronization. We performed simultaneous high-density electrocorticographic recordings across several visual areas in awake monkeys to investigate spatial patterns of local and inter-areal synchronization. We show that stimulation-induced patterns of inter-areal co-activation were reactivated in the absence of stimulation. Reactivation occurred through both, inter-areal co-fluctuation of local activity and inter-areal phase synchronization. Furthermore, the trial-by-trial covariance of the induced responses recapitulated the pattern of inter-areal coupling observed during stimulation, i.e. the signal correlation. Reactivation-related synchronization showed distinct peaks in the theta, alpha and gamma frequency bands. During passive states, this rhythmic reactivation was augmented by specific patterns of arrhythmic correspondence. These results suggest that networks of intrinsic covariation observed at multiple levels and with several recording techniques are related to synchronization and that behavioral state may affect the structure of intrinsic dynamics."
10.1101/021063,"When visualizing scientific data one of the current bottlenecks is the lack of interactivity. There already exist many options to build static data visualizations such as R, Matlab or Microsoft Excel among others. On the other hand, we can also find many different pieces of software with a broader or more specific aim that however must be installed locally. There is therefore a gap that is not covered by any of these latter two worlds. Here is where Biographika comes in handy since it provides scientists in general, and more specifically bioinformaticians, with a way of being able to use interactive rich visualizations on the web as part of their daily research. This first version of Biographika includes a set of charts combining diverse approaches that are thought to give users different perspectives of their research data. For the sake of interoperability and expressivity among other reasons we are using D3.js [1], the de facto standard visualization JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. But not only that, we incorporate new approaches as the fact of having fully interactive 3D charts that can be easily integrated with the rest of visualizations; providing the possibility of analyzing multidimensional data in a way that could otherwise be difficult to tackle. For that we use X3DOM[2], an open-source framework and runtime for 3D graphics on the Web that eases the integration of HTML5 and declarative 3D content. And last but not least, Biographika is also conceived as an effort to provide the data visualization layer for Bio4j [3] that researchers have been lacking in the past few years."
10.1101/020958,"Evolution of a novel function can greatly alter the effects of an organism on its environment. These environmental changes can, in turn, affect the further evolution of that organism and any coexisting organisms. We examine these effects and feedbacks following evolution of a novel function in the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) with Escherichia coli. A characteristic feature of E. coli is its inability to consume citrate aerobically. However, that ability evolved in one of the LTEE populations. In this population, citrate-utilizing bacteria (Cit+) coexisted stably with another clade of bacteria that lacked the capacity to utilize citrate (Cit-). This coexistence was shaped by the evolution of a cross-feeding relationship in which Cit+ cells released the dicarboxylic acids succinate, fumarate, and malate into the medium, and Cit- cells evolved improved growth on these carbon sources, as did the Cit+ cells. Thus, the evolution of citrate consumption led to a flask-based ecosystem that went from a single limiting resource, glucose, to one with five resources either shared or partitioned between two coexisting clades. Our findings show how evolutionary novelties can change environmental conditions, thereby facilitating diversity and altering both the structure of an ecosystem and the evolutionary trajectories of coexisting organisms.\n\nEvolution does not produce novelties from scratch. It works on what already exists, either transforming a system to give it new functions or combining several systems to produce a more elaborate one.\n\n-Francois Jacob"
10.1101/020164,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individuals genetic profile and correlates the \""imputed\"" gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. The genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome datasets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple testing burden, more comprehensive annotation of gene function compared to that derived from single variants, and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments while also integrating knowledge of regulatory function. Since no actual expression data are used in the analysis of GWAS data - only in silico expression - reverse causality problems are largely avoided. PrediXcan harnesses reference transcriptome data for disease mapping studies. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and novel genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations."

10.1101/021121,"Author SummaryThe CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as a powerful tool to engineer the genome of an organism. The system is adopted from bacteria where it confers immunity against invading foreign DNA. This work reports the first successful use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in C. briggsae, a cousin of the well-known nematode C. elegans. We used two plasmids, one expressing Cas9 endonuclease and the other an engineered CRISPR RNA corresponding to the DNA sequence to be cleaved. Our approach allows for the generation of loss-of-function mutations in C. briggsae genes thereby facilitating a comparative study of gene function between nematodes.\n\nAbstractThe CRISPR/Cas9 system is an efficient technique for generating targeted alterations in an organisms genome. Here we describe a methodology for using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate mutations via non-homologous end joining in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, a sister species of C. elegans. Evidence for somatic mutations and off-target mutations are also reported. The use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in C. briggsae will greatly facilitate comparative studies to C. elegans."
10.1101/021154,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrosophila melanogaster is a valuable invertebrate model for viral infection and antiviral immunity, and is a focus for studies of insect-virus coevolution. Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus associated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include distant relatives of known insect pathogens, but also novel groups of insect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs we show that the viruses represent active infections of Drosophila. We find that the RNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and we detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of small RNAs also allows us to identify putative viral sequences that lack detectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying >2000 individually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30% of D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry multiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont--which is known to be protective against virus infections in Drosophila--we were unable to detect any relationship between the presence of Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available RNA-seq datasets we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila laboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some of the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in laboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing viruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses are shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Our results provide an essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus interaction in Drosophila, and the newly reported viral sequences will help develop D. melanogaster further as a model for molecular and evolutionary virus research.\n\nDO_SCPLOWATAC_SCPLOW AO_SCPLOWVAILABILITYC_SCPLOWAll of the relevant data can be found within the paper and its Supporting Information files, with the exception of raw metagenomic sequence data which are deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRP056120), and sequence data which are deposited at Genbank (KP714070-KP714108, KP757922-KP757936 and KP757937-KP757993)"
10.1101/021113,"Hyponatremia is a serious complication of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use. We investigated potential mechanisms in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In study 1, healthy drug-experienced volunteers received MDMA or placebo alone and in combination with the alpha-1 adrenergic inverse agonist prazosin, used as a positive control to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In study 2, volunteers received MDMA or placebo followed by standardized water intake. MDMA lowered serum sodium, but did not increase ADH or copeptin, although the control prazosin did increase ADH. Water loading reduced serum sodium more after MDMA than after placebo. There was a trend for women to have lower baseline serum sodium than men, but there were no significant interactions with drug condition. Combining studies, MDMA potentiated the ability of water to lower serum sodium. Thus, hyponatremia appears to be a significant risk when hypotonic fluids are consumed during MDMA use.

10.1101/021212,"RNA-Seq and gene expression microarrays provide comprehensive profiles of gene activity, but lack of reproducibility has hindered their application. A key challenge in the data analysis is the normalization of gene expression levels, which is currently performed following an implicit assumption that most genes are not differentially expressed. Here, we present a mathematical approach to normalization that makes no assumption of this sort. We have found that variation in gene expression is much greater than currently believed, and that it can be measured with available technologies. Our results also explain, at least partially, the problems encountered in transcriptomics studies. We expect this improvement in detection to help efforts to realize the full potential of gene expression profiling, especially in analyses of cellular processes involving complex modulations of gene expression."
10.1101/021204,"Mammalian grid cells fire whenever an animal crosses the points of an imaginary, hexagonal grid tessellating the environment. Here, we show how animals can localize themselves and navigate by reading-out a simple population vector of grid cell activity across multiple scales, even though this activity is intrinsically stochastic. This theory of dead reckoning explains why grid cells are organized into modules with equal lattice scale and orientation. Computing the homing vector is least error-prone when the ratio of successive grid scales is around 3/2. Silencing intermediate-scale modules should cause systematic errors in navigation, while knocking out the module at the smallest scale will only affect navigational precision. Read-out neurons should behave like goal-vector cells subject to nonlinear gain fields."
10.1101/021238,"SummaryMany fundamental questions in evolutionary biology entail estimating rates of lineage diversification (speciation - extinction). We develop a flexible Bayesian framework for specifying an effectively infinite array of diversification models--where rates are constant, vary continuously, or change episodically through time--and implement numerical methods to estimate parameters of these models from molecular phylogenies, even when species sampling is incomplete. Additionally we provide robust methods for comparing the relative and absolute fit of competing branching-process models to a given tree, thereby providing rigorous tests of biological hypotheses regarding patterns and processes of lineage diversification.\n\nAvailability and implementationthe source code for TESS is freely available at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TESS/.\n\nContactSebastian.Hoehna@gmail.com"
10.1101/021261,"The large amount and high quality of genomic data available today enables, in principle, accurate inference of evolutionary history of observed populations. The Wright-Fisher model is one of the most widely used models for this purpose. It describes the stochastic behavior in time of allele frequencies and the influence of evolutionary pressures, such as mutation and selection. Despite its simple mathematical formulation, exact results for the distribution of allele frequency (DAF) as a function of time are not available in closed analytic form. Existing approximations build on the computationally intensive diffusion limit, or rely on matching moments of the DAF. One of the moment-based approximations relies on the beta distribution, which can accurately describe the DAF when the allele frequency is not close to the boundaries (zero and one). Nonetheless, under a Wright-Fisher model, the probability of being on the boundary can be positive, corresponding to the allele being either lost or fixed. Here, we introduce the beta with spikes, an extension of the beta approximation, which explicitly models the loss and fixation probabilities as two spikes at the boundaries. We show that the addition of spikes greatly improves the quality of the approximation. We additionally illustrate, using both simulated and real data, how the beta with spikes can be used for inference of divergence times between populations, with comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art method."
10.1101/021279,"Estimates of carbon flux to the deep oceans are essential for our understanding for global carbon budgets. We identify an important mechanism, the lipid pump, that has been unrecorded in previous estimates. The seasonal lipid pump is highly efficient in sequestering carbon in the deep ocean. It involves the vertical transport and respiration of carbon rich compounds (lipids) by hibernating zooplankton. Estimates for one species, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus overwintering in the North Atlantic, sequester around the same amount of carbon as does the flux of detrital material that is usually thought of as the main component of the biological pump. The efficiency of the lipid pump derives from a near complete decoupling between nutrient and carbon cycling and directly transports carbon through the meso-pelagic with very little attenuation to below the permanent thermocline. Consequently the seasonal transport of lipids by migrating zooplankton is overlooked in estimates of deep ocean carbon sequestration by the biological pump."
10.1101/021220,"Predictions from theory, field data, and experiments have shown that high landscape connectivity promotes higher species richness than low connectivity. However, examples demonstrating high diversity in low connected landscapes also exist. Here we describe the many factors that drive landscape connectivity at different spatiotemporal scales by varying the amplitude and frequency of changes in the dispersal radius of spatial networks. We found that the fluctuations of landscape connectivity support metacommunities with higher species richness than static landscapes. Our results also show a dispersal radius threshold below which species richness drops dramatically in static landscapes. Such a threshold is not observed in dynamic landscapes for a broad range of amplitude and frequency values determining landscape connectivity. We conclude that merging amplitude and frequency as drivers of landscape connectivity together with patch dynamics into metacommunity theory can provide new testable predictions about species diversity in rapidly changing landscapes."
10.1101/021246,"Advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have allowed researchers to obtain large amounts of biological sequence information at speeds and costs unimaginable only a decade ago. Phylogenetics, and the study of evolution in general, is quickly migrating towards using HTS to generate larger and more complex molecular datasets. In this paper, we present a method that utilizes microfluidic PCR and HTS to generate large amounts of sequence data suitable for phylogenetic analyses. The approach uses a Fluidigm microfluidic PCR array and two sets of PCR primers to simultaneously amplify 48 target regions across 48 samples, incorporating sample-specific barcodes and HTS adapters (2,304 unique amplicons per microfluidic array). The final product is a pooled set of amplicons ready to be sequenced, and thus, there is no need to construct separate, costly genomic libraries for each sample. Further, we present a bioinformatics pipeline to process the raw HTS reads to either generate consensus sequences (with or without ambiguities) for every locus in every sample or--more importantly--recover the separate alleles from heterozygous target regions in each sample. This is important because it adds allelic information that is well suited for coalescent-based phylogenetic analyses that are becoming very common in conservation and evolutionary biology. To test our subgenomic method and bioinformatics pipeline, we sequenced 576 samples across 96 target regions belonging to the South American clade of the genus Bartsia L. in the plant family Orobanchaceae. After sequencing cleanup and alignment, the experiment resulted in [~]25,300bp across 486 samples for a set of 48 primer pairs targeting the plastome, and [~]13,500bp for 363 samples for a set of primers targeting regions in the nuclear genome. Finally, we constructed a combined concatenated matrix from all 96 primer combinations, resulting in a combined aligned length of [~]40,500bp for 349 samples."
10.1101/021253,"BackgroundGathering genomic-scale data efficiently is challenging for non-model species with large, complex genomes. Transcriptome sequencing is accessible for even large-genome organisms, and sequence capture probes can be designed from such mRNA sequences to enrich and sequence exonic regions. Maximizing enrichment efficiency is important to reduce sequencing costs, but, relatively little data exist for exon capture experiments in large-genome non-model organisms. Here, we conducted a replicated factorial experiment to explore the effects of several modifications to standard protocols that might increase sequence capture efficiency for large-genome amphibians.\n\nMethodsWe enriched 53 genomic libraries from salamanders for a custom set of 8,706 exons under differing conditions. Libraries were prepared using pools of DNA from 3 different salamanders with approximately 30 gigabase genomes: California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense), barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium), and an F1 hybrid between the two. We enriched libraries using different amounts of c0t-1 blocker, individual input DNA, and total reaction DNA. Enriched libraries were sequenced with 150 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, and the efficiency of target enrichment was quantified using unique read mapping rates and average depth across targets. The different enrichment treatments were evaluated to determine if c0t-1 and input DNA significantly impact enrichment efficiency in large-genome amphibians.\n\nResultsIncreasing the amounts of c0t-1 and individual input DNA both reduce the rates of PCR duplication. This reduction led to an increase in the percentage of unique reads mapping to target sequences, essentially doubling overall efficiency of the target capture from 10.4% to nearly 19.9%. We also found that post-enrichment DNA concentrations and qPCR enrichment verification were useful for predicting the success of enrichment.\n\nConclusionsIncreasing the amount of individual sample input DNA and the amount of c0t-1 blocker both increased the efficiency of target capture in large-genome salamanders. By reducing PCR duplication rates, the number of unique reads mapping to targets increased, making target capture experiments more efficient and affordable. Our results indicate that target capture protocols can be modified to efficiently screen large-genome vertebrate taxa including amphibians."
10.1101/021147,"Human genes exhibit different effects on fitness in cancer and normal cells. Here, we present an evolutionary approach to measure the selection pressure on human genes, using the well-known ratio of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate in both cancer genomes (CN/CS) and normal populations (pN/pS). A new mutation-profile-based method that adopts sample-specific mutation rate profiles instead of conventional substitution models was developed. We found that cancer-specific selection pressure is quite different from the selection pressure at the species and population levels. Both the relaxation of purifying selection on passenger mutations and the positive selection of driver mutations may contribute to the increased CN/CS values of human genes in cancer genomes compared with the pN/pS values in human populations. The CN/CS values also contribute to the improved classification of cancer genes and a better understanding of the onco-functionalization of cancer genes during oncogenesis. The use of our computational pipeline to identify cancer-specific positively and negatively selected genes may provide useful information for understanding the evolution of cancers and identifying possible targets for therapeutic intervention."

It remains to be determined whether there are genetic connections between the 2 disorders. A female F2 cohort, generated from BALB/cJ (BALB) and SM/J (SM) Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) strains, was fed a Western diet for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma glucose and lipid levels were measured before and after Western diet feeding. 144 genetic markers across the entire genome were used for analysis. One significant QTL on chromosome 9, named Bglu17 [26.4 cM, logarithm of odds ratio (LOD): 5.4], and 3 suggestive QTLs were identified for fasting glucose levels. The suggestive QTL near the proximal end of chromosome 9 (2.4 cM, LOD: 3.12) was detected when mice were fed chow or Western diet and named Bglu16. Bglu17 coincided with a significant QTL for HDL and a suggestive QTL for non-HDL cholesterol levels. Plasma glucose levels were inversely correlated with HDL but positively correlated with non-HDL cholesterol levels in F2 mice fed either diet. A significant correlation between fasting glucose and triglyceride levels was observed on the Western but not chow diet. Haplotype analysis revealed that \""lipid genes\"" Sik3 and Apoc3 were probable candidates for Bglu17. We have identified multiple QTLs for fasting glucose and lipid levels. The colocalization of QTLs for both phenotypes and the sharing of potential causal genes suggest that dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes are genetically connected.\n\nArticle SummaryPatients with dyslipidemia often develop type 2 diabetes, and diabetic patients often have dyslipidemia.

10.1101/021303,"Current statistical biogeographical analysis methods are limited in the ways ecology can be related to the processes of diversification and geographical range evolution, requiring conflation of geography and ecology, and/or assuming ecologies that are uniform across all lineages and invariant in time. This precludes the possibility of studying a broad class of macro-evolutionary biogeographical theories that relate geographical and species histories through iineage-specific ecological and evolutionary dynamics, such as taxon cycle theory. Here we present a new model that generates phylogenies under a complex of superpositioned geographical range evolution, trait evolution, and diversification processes that can communicate with each other. This means that, under our model, the diversification and transition of the states of a lineage through geographical space is separate from, yet is conditional on, the state of the lineage in trait space (or vice versa). We present a likelihood-free method of inference under our model using discriminant analysis of principal components of summary statistics calculated on phylogenies, with the discriminant functions trained on data generated by simulations under our model. This approach of model classification is shown to be efficient, robust, and performant over a broad range of parameter space defined by the relative rates of dispersal, trait evolution, and diversification processes. We apply our method to a case study of the taxon cycle, i.e. testing for habitat and trophic-level constraints in the dispersal regimes of the Wallacean avifaunal radiation."

10.1101/021378,"Frequency dependent selection and demographic fluctuations play important roles in evolutionary and ecological processes. Under frequency dependent selection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based on interactions between individuals within the population. This should be reflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environ ments. Here, we propose a stochastic model, which naturally combines these two evolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency dependent competition between different types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game theoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population and thus the population size is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated by evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite population size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by the deterministic competitive LotkaVolterra equations. In small populations, demographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire population. As the population size is driven by the fitness in evolutionary games, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a population of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size, the population would thrive regardless of its average payoff."
10.1101/021311,"The development and evolution of complex neocortical organisations is thought to result from the interaction of genetic and activity-dependent processes. Here we propose that a third type of process - mechanical morphogenesis - may also play an important role. We review recent theoretical and experimental results in non-linear physics showing how homogeneous growth can produce a rich variety of forms, in particular neocortical folding. The mechanical instabilities that produce these forms also induce heterogeneous patterns of stress at the scale of the organ. We review the evidence showing how these stresses can influence cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis, cell differentiation and shape, migration and axonal guidance, and could thus be able to influence regional neocortical identity and connectivity."
10.1101/021329,"The drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \""ecstasy\"", \""molly\"") is a widely used illicit drug and experimental adjunct to psychotherapy. MDMA has unusual, poorly understood socioemotional effects, including feelings of interpersonal closeness and sociability. To better understand these effects, we conducted a within-subjects double-blind placebo controlled study of the effects of 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA on social emotions and autobiographical disclosure in a controlled setting. MDMA displayed both sedative- and stimulant-like effects, including increased self-report anxiety. At the same time, MDMA positively altered evaluation of the self (i.e., increasing feelings of authenticity) while decreasing concerns about negative evaluation by others (i.e., decreasing social anxiety). Consistent with these feelings, MDMA increased how comfortable participants felt describing emotional memories. Overall, MDMA produced a prosocial syndrome that seemed to facilitate emotional disclosure and that appears consistent with the suggestion that it represents a novel pharmacological class."
10.1101/021436,"Cytosine methylation is widespread in most eukaryotic genomes and is known to play a substantial role in various regulatory pathways. Unmethylated cytosines may be converted to uracil through the addition of sodium bisulphite, allowing genome-wide quantification of cytosine methylation via high-throughput sequencing. The data thus acquired allows the discovery of methylation  loci; contiguous regions of methylation consistently methylated across biological replicates. The mapping of these loci allows for associations with other genomic factors to be identified, and for analyses of differential methylation to take place.\n\nThe segmentSeq R package is extended to identify methylation loci from high-throughput sequencing data from multiple experimental conditions. A statistical model is then developed that accounts for biological replication and variable rates of non-conversion of cytosines in each sample to compute posterior likelihoods of methylation at each locus within an empirical Bayesian framework. The same model is used as a basis for analysis of differential methylation between multiple experimental conditions with the baySeq R package. We demonstrate this method through an analysis of data derived from Dicer-like mutants in Arabidopsis that reveals complex interactions between the different Dicer-like mutants and their methylation pathways. We also show in simulation studies that this approach can be significantly more powerful in the detection of differential methylation than existing methods."
10.1101/021428,"The recently developed  two-step behavioural task promises to differentiate model-based or goal-directed from model-free or habitual reinforcement learning, while generating neurophysiologically-friendly decision datasets with parametric variation of decision variables. These desirable features have prompted widespread adoption of the task. However, the signatures of model-based control can be elusive - here, we investigate model-free learning methods that, depending on the analysis strategy, can masquerade as being model-based. We first show that unadorned model-free reinforcement learning can induce correlations between action values at the start of the trial and the subsequent trial events in such a way that analysis based on comparing successive trials can lead to erroneous conclusions. We also suggest a correction to the analysis that can alleviate this problem. We then consider model-free reinforcement learning strategies based on different state representations from those envisioned by the experimenter, which generate behaviour that appears model-based under these, and also more sophisticated, analyses. The existence of such strategies is of particular relevance to the design and interpretation of animal studies using the two-step task, as extended training and a sharp contrast between good and bad options are likely to promote their use.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlanning is the use of a predictive model of the consequences of actions to guide decision making. Planning plays a critical role in human behaviour but isolating its contribution is challenging because it is complemented by control systems which learn values of actions directly from the history of reinforcement, resulting in automatized mappings from states to actions often termed habits. Our study examined a recently developed behavioural task which uses choices in a multi-step decision tree to differentiate planning from value-based control. Using simulation, we demonstrated the existence of strategies which produce behaviour that resembles planning but in fact arises as a fixed mapping from particular sorts of states to actions. These results show that when a planning problem is faced repeatedly, sophisticated automatization strategies may be developed which identify that there are in fact a limited number of relevant states of the world each with an appropriate fixed or habitual response. Understanding such strategies is important for the design and interpretation of tasks which aim to isolate the contribution of planning to behaviour. Such strategies are also of independent scientific interest as they may contribute to automatization of behaviour in complex environments."

10.1101/021469,"Epistasis plays a significant role in the genetic architecture of many complex phenotypes in model organisms. To date, there have been very few interactions replicated in human studies due in part to the multiple hypothesis burden implicit in genome-wide tests of epistasis. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop the most powerful tests possible for detecting interactions. In this work we develop a new gene-gene interaction test for use in trio studies called the trio correlation (TC) test. The TC test computes the expected joint distribution of marker pairs in offspring conditional on parental genotypes. This distribution is then incorporated into a standard one degree of freedom correlation test of interaction. We show via extensive simulations that our test substantially outperforms existing tests of interaction in trio studies. The gain in power under standard models of phenotype is large, with previous tests requiring more than twice the number of trios to obtain the power of our test. We also demonstrate a bias in a previous trio interaction test and identify its origin. We conclude that the TC test shows improved power to identify interactions in existing, as well as emerging, trio association studies. The method is publicly available at www.github.com/BrunildaBalliu/TrioEpi."
10.1101/021485,"Models of the evolution of collective action typically assume that interactions occur in groups of identical size. In contrast, social interactions between animals occur in groups of widely dispersed size. This article models collective action problems as two-strategy multiplayer games and studies the effect of variability in group size on the evolution of cooperative behavior under the replicator dynamics. The analysis identifies elementary conditions on the payoff structure of the game implying that the evolution of cooperative behavior is promoted or inhibited when the group size experienced by a focal player is more or less variable. Similar but more stringent conditions are applicable when the confounding effect of size-biased sampling, which causes the group-size distribution experienced by a focal player to differ from the statistical distribution of group sizes, is taken into account."
10.1101/021568,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system provides unprecedented genome editing capabilities; however, several facets of this system are under investigation for further characterization and optimization, including the choice of guide RNA that directs Cas9 to target DNA. In particular, given that one would like to target the protein-coding region of a gene, hundreds of guides satisfy the basic constraints of the CRISPR/Cas9 Protospacer Adjacent Motif sequence (PAM); however, not all of these guides actually generate gene knockouts with equal efficiency. Leveraging a broad set of experimental measurements of guide knockout efficiency, we introduce a state-of-the art in silico modeling approach to identify guides that will lead to more effective gene knockout. We first investigated which guide and gene features are critical for prediction (e.g., single- and di-nucleotide identity of the gene target), which are helpful (e.g., thermodynamics), and which are predictive but redundant (e.g., microhomology). We also investigated evaluation measures for comparing predictive models in the present context, suggesting that Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve is not ideal. Finally, we explored a variety of different model classes and found that use of gradient-boosted regression trees produced the best predictive performance.

10.1101/021444,"Detection of genomic variants is commonly conducted by aligning a set of reads sequenced from an individual to the reference genome of the species and analyzing the resulting read pileup. Typically, this process finds a subset of variants already reported in databases and additional novel variants characteristic to the sequenced individual. Most of the effort in the literature has been put to the alignment problem on a single reference sequence, although our gathered knowledge on species such as human is pan-genomic: We know most of the common variation in addition to the reference sequence. There have been some efforts to exploit pan-genome indexing, where the most widely adopted approach is to build an index structure on a set of reference sequences containing observed variation combinations.\n\nThe enhancement in alignment accuracy when using pan-genome indexing has been demonstrated in experiments, but so far the above multiple references pan-genome indexing approach has not been tested on its final goal, that is, in enhancing variation detection. This is the focus of this article: We study a generic approach to add variation detection support on top of the multiple references pan-genomic indexing approach. Namely, we study the read pileup on a multiple alignment of reference genomes, and propose a heaviest path algorithm to extract a new recombined reference sequence. This recombined reference sequence can then be utilized in any standard read alignment and variation detection workflow. We demonstrate that the approach enhances variation detection on realistic data sets."
10.1101/021527,"AbstractThe advent of cost-effective DNA sequencing has provided clinics with high-resolution information about patients genetic variants, which has resulted in the need for efficient interpretation of this genomic data. Traditionally, variant interpretation has been dominated by many manual, time-consuming processes due to the disparate forms of relevant information in clinical databases and literature. Computational techniques promise to automate much of this, and while they currently play only a supporting role, their continued improvement for variant interpretation is necessary to tackle the problem of scaling genetic sequencing to ever larger populations.

10.1101/021501,"Ribosome-footprint profiling provides genome-wide snapshots of translation, but technical challenges can confound its analysis. Here, we use improved methods to obtain ribosome-footprint profiles and mRNA abundances that more faithfully reflect gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results support proposals that both the beginning of coding regions and codons matching rare tRNAs are more slowly translated. They also indicate that emergent polypeptides with as few as three basic residues within a 10-residue window tend to slow translation. With the improved mRNA measurements, the variation attributable to translational control in exponentially growing yeast was less than previously reported, and most of this variation could be predicted with a simple model that considered mRNA abundance, upstream open reading frames, cap-proximal structure and nucleotide composition, and lengths of the coding and 5-untranslated regions. Collectively, our results reveal key features of translational control in yeast and provide a framework for executing and interpreting ribosome-profiling studies."
10.1101/021519,"The advent of whole-genome sequencing has generated increased interest in modeling the structure of strain mixture within clinicial infections of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). The life cycle of the parasite implies that the mixture of multiple strains within an infected individual is related to the out-crossing rate across populations, making methods for measuring this process in situ central to understanding the genetic epidemiology of the disease. In this paper, we show how to estimate inbreeding coefficients using genomic data from Pf clinical samples, providing a simple metric for assessing within-sample mixture that connects to an extensive literature in population genetics and conservation ecology. Features of the P. falciparum genome mean that some standard methods for inbreeding coefficients and related F-statistics cannot be used directly. Here, we review an initial effort to estimate the inbreeding coefficient within clinical isolates of P. falciparum and provide several generalizations using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Bayesian approach connects these estimates to the Balding-Nichols model, a mainstay within genetic epidemiology. We provide simulation results on the performance of the estimators and show their use on ~ 1500 samples from the PF3K data set. We also compare the results to output from a recent mixture model for within-sample strain mixture, showing that inbreeding coefficients provide a strong proxy for the results of these more complex models. We provide the methods described within an open-source R package pfmix."
10.1101/021576,"Website SummarySmall RNAs are important regulators of gene expression; however, the relationship between small RNAs is poorly understood. Studying the crosstalk between small RNA pathways can help understand how gene expression is regulated. One hypothesis suggests that small RNA competition arises from limited enzymatic resources. Therefore, a model was created in order to gain insights into this competition.\n\nAbstractSmall RNAs have been determined to have an essential role in gene regulation. However, competition between small RNAs is a poorly understood aspect of small RNA dynamics. Recent evidence has suggested that competition between small RNA pathways arises from a scarcity of common resources essential for small RNA activity. In order to understand how competition affects small RNAs in C. elegans, a system of differential equations was used. The model recreates normal behavior of small RNAs and uses random sampling in order to determine the coefficients of competition for each small RNA class. The model includes endogenous small-interfering RNAs (endo-siRNA), exogenous small-interfering RNAs (exo-siRNA), and microRNAs (miRNA). The model predicts that exo-siRNAs is dominated by competition between endo-siRNAs and miRNAs. Furthermore, the model predicts that competition is required for normal levels of endogenous small RNAs to be maintained. Although the model makes several assumptions about cell dynamics, the model is still useful in order to understand competition between small RNA pathways."
10.1101/021550,"Spatial structure greatly affects the evolution of cooperation. While in two-player games the condition for cooperation to evolve depends on a single structure coefficient, in multiplayer games the condition might depend on several structure coefficients, making it difficult to compare different population structures. We propose a solution to this issue by introducing two simple ways of ordering population structures: the containment order and the volume order. If population structure [S]1 is greater than population structure [S]2 in the containment or the volume order, then [S]1 can be considered a stronger promoter of cooperation. We provide conditions for establishing the containment order, give general results on the volume order, and illustrate our theory by comparing different models of spatial games and associated update rules. Our results hold for a large class of population structures and can be easily applied to specific cases once the structure coefficients have been calculated or estimated."

10.1101/021618,"Altered chromatin structure is a hallmark of cancer, and inappropriate regulation of chromatin structure may represent the origin of transformation. Important studies have mapped human nucleosome distributions genome wide, but the role of chromatin structure in cancer progression has not been addressed. We developed a MNase-Transcription Start Site Sequence Capture method (mTSS-seq) to map the nucleosome distribution at human transcription start sites genome-wide in primary human lung and colon adenocarcinoma tissue. Here, we confirm that nucleosome redistribution is an early, widespread event in lung (LAC) and colon (CRC) adenocarcinoma. These altered nucleosome architectures are consistent between LAC and CRC patient samples indicating that they may serve as important early adenocarcinoma markers. We demonstrate that the nucleosome alterations are driven by the underlying DNA sequence and potentiate transcription factor binding. We conclude that DNA-directed nucleosome redistributions are widespread early in cancer progression. We have proposed an entirely new hierarchical model for chromatin-mediated genome regulation.\n\nSignificanceThis is the first report of human nucleosome distribution in cancer progression using sequence capture and HiSeq. We show in lung and colorectal adenocarcinoma patients that nucleosome distribution is a widespread, early response driven by genetically-encoded signals and potentiate regulatory factor binding. We present a model for chromatin-based hierarchical regulation."
10.1101/021600,"It is known that rates of mutation and recombination vary across the genome in many species. Here we investigate whether these factors affect the rate at which genes undergo adaptive evolution both individually and in combination and quantify the degree to which Hill-Robertson interference (HRi) impedes the rate of adaptive evolution. To do this we compiled a dataset of 6,141 autosomal protein coding genes from Drosophila, for which we have polymorphism data from D. melanogaster and divergence out to D. yakuba. We estimated the rate of adaptive evolution using a derivative of the McDonald-Kreitman test that controls for the slightly deleterious mutations. We find that the rate of adaptive amino acid substitution is positively correlated to both the rates of recombination and mutation. We also find that these correlations are robust to controlling for each other, synonymous codon bias and gene functions related to immune response and testes. We estimate that HRi reduces the rate of adaptive evolution by [~]27%. We also show that this fraction depends on a genes mutation rate; genes with low mutation rates lose [~]11% of their adaptive substitutions while genes with high mutation rates lose [~]43%. In conclusion, we show that the mutation rate and the rate of recombination, are important modifiers of the rate of adaptive evolution in Drosophila."
10.1101/021535,"In cancer, mitochondrial dysfunction, through mutations, deletions, and changes in copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), contributes to the malignant transformation and progress of tumors. Here, we report the first large-scale survey of mtDNA copy number variation across 21 distinct solid tumor types, examining over 13,000 tissue samples profiled with next-generation sequencing methods. We find a tendency for cancers, especially of the bladder and kidney, to be significantly depleted of mtDNA, relative to matched normal tissue. We show that mtDNA copy number is correlated to the expression of mitochondrially-localized metabolic pathways, suggesting that mtDNA copy number variation reflect gross changes in mitochondrial metabolic activity. Finally, we identify a subset of tumor-type-specific somatic alterations, including IDH1 and NF1 mutations in gliomas, whose incidence is strongly correlated to mtDNA copy number. Our findings suggest that modulation of mtDNA copy number may play a role in the pathology of cancer."
10.1101/021659,"Molecular simulations intended to compute equilibrium properties are often initiated from configurations that are highly atypical of equilibrium samples, a practice which can generate a distinct initial transient in mechanical observables computed from the simulation trajectory. Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial portion be discarded to equilibration, but no simple, general, and automated procedure for this process exists. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest, in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure, and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data."
10.1101/021642,"During cell division chromosomes are compacted in length by more than a hundred-fold. A wide range of experiments demonstrated that in their compacted state, mammalian chromosomes form arrays of closely stacked consecutive [~]100Kb loops. The mechanism underlying the active process of chromosome compaction into a stack of loops is unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that chromosomes are compacted by enzymatic machines that actively extrude chromatin loops. When such loop-extruding factors (LEF) bind to chromosomes, they progressively bridge sites that are further away along the chromosome, thus extruding a loop. We demonstrate that collective action of LEFs leads to formation of a dynamic array of consecutive loops. Simulations and an analytically solved model identify two distinct steady states: a sparse state where loops are highly dynamic but provide little compaction, and a dense state with more stable loops and dramatic chromosome compaction. We find that human chromosomes operate at the border of the dense steady state. Our analysis also shows how the macroscopic characteristics of the loop array are determined by the microscopic properties of LEFs and their abundance. When number of LEFs are used that match experimentally based estimates, the model can quantitatively reproduce the average loop length, the degree of compaction, and the general loop-array morphology of compact human chromosomes. Our study demonstrates that efficient chromosome compaction can be achieved solely by an active loop-extrusion process.\n\nSignificance StatementDuring cell division chromosomes are compacted in length more than a hundred-fold and are folded in arrays of loops. The mechanism underlying this essential biological process is unknown. Here we test whether chromosome compaction can be performed by molecular machines that actively extrude chromatin loops. These machines bind to DNA and progressively bridge sites that are further and further away along the chromosome. We demonstrate that the collective action of loop-extruding machines can fold a chromosome into a dynamic array of loops. Simulated chromosome agrees with compact human chromosomes in its degree of compaction, loop size and the general loop-array morphology. Our study demonstrates that efficient chromosome compaction can be achieved solely by such active loop-extrusion process."
10.1101/021709,"We present here a fast and flexible software -SimPhy- for the simulation of multiple gene families evolving under incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss, horizontal gene transfer -all three potentially leading to the species tree/gene tree discordance- and gene conversion. SimPhy implements a hierarchical phylogenetic model in which the evolution of species, locus and gene trees is governed by global and local parameters (e.g., genome-wide, species-specific, locus-specific), that can be fixed or be sampled from a priori statistical distributions. SimPhy also incorporates comprehensive models of substitution rate variation among lineages (uncorrelated relaxed clocks) and the capability of simulating partitioned nucleotide, codon and protein multilocus sequence alignments under a plethora of substitution models using the program INDELible. We validate SimPhys output using theoretical expectations and other programs, and show that it scales extremely well with complex models and/or large trees, being an order of magnitude faster than the most similar program (DLCoal-Sim). In addition, we demonstrate how SimPhy can be useful to understand interactions among different evolutionary processes, conducting a simulation study to characterize the systematic overestimation of the duplication time when using standard reconciliation methods. SimPhy is available at https://github.com/adamallo/SimPhy, where users can find the source code, pre-compiled executables, a detailed manual and example cases."
10.1101/021360,"Organismal stoichiometry refers to the relative proportion of chemical elements in the biomass of organisms, and it can have important effects on ecological interactions from population to ecosystem scales. Although stoichiometry has been studied extensively from an ecological perspective, little is known about rates and directions of evolutionary changes in elemental composition in response to nutrient limitation. We measured carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of Escherichia coli evolved under controlled carbon-limited conditions for 50,000 generations. The bacteria evolved higher relative nitrogen and phosphorus content, consistent with selection for increased use of the more abundant elements. Total carbon assimilated also increased, indicating more efficient use of the limiting element. Altogether, our study shows that stoichiometry evolved over a relatively short time-period, and that it did so in a predictable direction given the carbon-limiting environment."

10.1101/021634,"Second-generation sequencers (SGS) have been game-changing, achieving cost-effective whole genome sequencing in many non-model organisms. However, a large portion of the genomes still remains unassembled. We reconstructed azuki bean (Vigna angularis) genome using single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology and achieved the best contiguity and coverage among currently assembled legume crops. The SMRT-based assembly produced 100 times longer contigs with 100 times smaller amount of gaps compared to the SGS-based assemblies. A detailed comparison between the assemblies revealed that the SMRT-based assembly enabled a more comprehensive gene annotation than the SGS-based assemblies where thousands of genes were missing or fragmented. A chromosome-scale assembly was generated based on the high-density genetic map, covering 86% of the azuki bean genome. We demonstrated that SMRT technology, though still needed support of SGS data, achieved a near-complete assembly of a eukaryotic genome."
10.1101/021691,"A key experimental approach in neuroscience involves measuring neuronal activity in behaving animals with extracellular chronic recordings. Such chronic recordings were initially made with single electrodes and tetrodes, and are now increasingly performed with high-density, high-count silicon probes. A common way to achieve long-term chronic recording is to attach the probes to microdrives that progressively advance them into the brain and isolate them from mechanical forces. Here we report, however, that such microdrives are not strictly necessary. Indeed, we obtained high-quality recordings in both head-fixed and freely moving mice for several months following the implantation of immobile chronic probes. Probes implanted into the primary visual cortex yielded well-isolated single units whose spike waveform and orientation tuning were highly reproducible over time. Although electrode drift was not completely absent, at least 70% of neurons retained their waveform across days. Thus, immobile silicon probes represent a straightforward and reliable technique to obtain stable, long-term population recordings in mice, and to follow the activity of populations of well-isolated neurons over multiple days."
10.1101/021667,"Sharing of experimental clinical research data usually happens between individuals or research groups rather than via public repositories, in part due to the need to protect research participant privacy. This approach to data sharing makes it difficult to connect journal articles with their underlying datasets and is often insufficient for ensuring access to data in the long term. Voluntary data sharing services such as the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) and Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) projects have increased accessibility to clinical datasets for secondary uses while protecting patient privacy and the legitimacy of secondary analyses but these resources are generally disconnected from journal articles - where researchers typically search for reliable information to inform future research. New scholarly journal and article types dedicated to increasing accessibility of research data have emerged in recent years and, in general, journals are developing stronger links with data repositories. There is a need for increased collaboration between journals, data repositories, researchers, funders, and voluntary data sharing services to increase the visibility and reliability of clinical research. We propose changes to the format and peer-review process for journal articles to more robustly link them to data that are only available on request. We also propose additional features for data repositories to better accommodate non-public clinical datasets, including Data Use Agreements (DUAs)."
10.1101/021717,"BackgroundThe high-dose hook effect (also called prozone effect) refers to the observation that if a multivalent protein acts as a linker between two parts of a protein complex, then increasing the amount of linker protein in the mixture does not always increase the amount of fully formed complex. On the contrary, at a high enough concentration range the amount of fully formed complex actually decreases. It has been observed that allosterically regulated proteins seem less susceptible to this effect. The aim of this study was two-fold: First, to investigate the mathematical basis of how allostery mitigates the prozone effect. And second, to explore the consequences of allostery and the high-dose hook effect using the example of calmodulin, a calcium-sensing protein that regulates the switch between long-term potentiation and long-term depression in neurons.\n\nResultsWe use a combinatorial model of a \""perfect linker protein\"" (with infinite binding affinity) to mathematically describe the hook effect and its behaviour under allosteric conditions. We show that allosteric regulation does indeed mitigate the high-dose hook effect. We then turn to calmodulin as a real-life example of an allosteric protein. Using kinetic simulations, we show that calmodulin is indeed subject to a hook effect. We also show that this effect is stronger in the presence of the allosteric activator Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), because it reduces the overall cooperativity of the calcium-calmodulin system. It follows that, surprisingly, there are conditions where increased amount of allosteric activator actually decrease the activity of a protein.\n\nConclusionsWe show that cooperative binding can indeed act as a protective mechanism against the hook effect. This will have implications in vivo where the extent of cooperativity of a protein can be modulated, for instance, by allosteric activators or inhibitors. This can result in counterintuitive effects of decreased activity with increased concentrations of both the allosteric protein itself and its allosteric activators."
10.1101/021725,"Genome organization is crucial for efficiently responding to DNA damage and regulating transcription. In this study, we relate the genome organization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) to its transcription activity by analyzing published circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) data in conjunction with eight separate datasets describing genome-wide transcription rate or RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy. We find that large chromosome segments are more likely to interact in areas that have high transcription rate or Pol II occupancy. Additionally, we find that groups of genes with similar transcription rates or similar Pol II occupancy are more likely to have higher numbers of chromosomal interactions than groups of random genes. We hypothesize that transcription localization occurs around sets of genes with similar transcription rates, and more often around genes that are highly transcribed, in order to produce more efficient transcription. Our analysis cannot discern whether gene co-localization occurs because of similar transcription rates or whether similar transcription rates are a consequence of co-localization."
10.1101/021733,"Current sequencing of mRNA can provide estimates of the levels of individual isoforms within the cell, where isoforms are the different distinct mRNA products or proteins created by a gene. It remains to adapt many standard statistical methods commonly used for analyzing gene expression levels to take advantage of this additional information. One novel question is whether we can find groupings or clusters of samples that are distinguished not by their gene expression but by their isoform usage. Such clusters in tumors, for example, could be the result of shared disruption to the splicing system that creates the different isoforms. We propose a novel approach to clustering mRNA-Seq data that identifies clusters of samples with common isoform usage. We show via simulation that our methods are more sensitive to finding clusters of similar alternative splicing patterns than standard clustering techniques applied directly to the estimates of isoform levels. We further demonstrate that clustering on isoform usage is more accurate than clustering directly on isoform levels by examining real data that contains a technical artifact that resulted in different batches having different isoform usage patterns.

10.1101/021741,"BackgroundSeveral R packages exist for the detection of differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. The analysis process includes three main steps, namely normalization, dispersion estimation and test for differential expression. Quality control steps along this process are recommended but not mandatory, and failing to check the characteristics of the dataset may lead to spurious results. In addition, normalization methods and statistical models are not exchangeable across the packages without adequate transformations the users are often not aware of. Thus, dedicated analysis pipelines are needed to include systematic quality control steps and prevent errors from misusing the proposed methods.\n\nResultsSARTools is an R pipeline for differential analysis of RNA-Seq count data. It can handle designs involving two or more conditions of a single biological factor with or without a blocking factor (such as a batch effect or a sample pairing). It is based on DESeq2 and edgeR and is composed of an R package and two R script templates (for DESeq2 and edgeR respectively). Tuning a small number of parameters and executing one of the R scripts, users have access to the full results of the analysis, including lists of differentially expressed genes and a HTML report that (i) displays diagnostic plots for quality control and model hypotheses checking and (ii) keeps track of the whole analysis process, parameter values and versions of the R packages used.\n\nConclusionsSARTools provides systematic quality controls of the dataset as well as diagnostic plots that help to tune the model parameters. It gives access to the main parameters of DESeq2 and edgeR and prevents untrained users from misusing some functionalities of both packages. By keeping track of all the parameters of the analysis process it fits the requirements of reproducible research."
10.1101/021766,We report on an experiment and calculations that determine the thermal motion of a voltage-clamped ssDNA-NeutrAvidin complex in an MspA nanopore. The electric force and diffusion constant of DNA inside an MspA pore have been determined in order to evaluate DNAs thermal position fluctuations. We show that an out-of-equilibrium state returns to equilibrium so quickly that experiments usually measure a weighted average over the equilibrium position distribution. Averaging over the equilibrium position distribution is consistent with results of state-of-the-art nanopore sequencing experiments. It is shown that a reduction in thermal averaging can be achieved by increasing the electrophoretic force used in nanopore sequencing devices.
10.1101/021386,"Mendelian randomization is a promising approach to help improve causal inference in observational studies, with widespread potential applications, including to prioritization of pharmacotherapeutic targets for evaluation in RCTs. From its initial proposal the limitations of Mendelian randomization approaches have been widely recognised and discussed, and recently Pickrell has reiterated these1. However this critique did not acknowledge recent developments in both methodological and empirical research, nor did it recognise many future opportunities for application of the Mendelian randomization approach. These issues are briefly reviewed here."
10.1101/021782,Quantitative relations in protein and RNA folding are deduced from the quantum folding theory of macromolecules. It includes: deduction of the law on the temperature-dependence of folding rate and its tests on protein dataset; study on the chain-length dependence of the folding rate for a large class of biomolecules; deduction of the statistical relation of folding free energy versus chain-length; and deduction of the statistical relation between folding rate and chain length and its test on protein and RNA dataset. In the above quantum approach the influence of the solvent environment factor on folding rate has been taken into account automatically. The successes of the deduction of these new relations from the first principle and their successful comparison with experimental data afford strong evidence on the possible existence of a common quantum mechanism in the conformational change of biomolecules.
10.1101/021824,"Deeper understanding of the anatomical intermediaries for disease and other complex genetic traits is essential to understanding mechanisms and developing new interventions. Existing ontology tools provide functional annotations for many genes in the genome and they are widely used to develop mechanistic hypotheses based on genetic and transcriptomic data. Yet, information about where a set of genes is expressed may be equally useful in interpreting results and forming novel mechanistic hypotheses for a trait. Therefore, we developed a framework for statistically testing the relationship between gene expression across the body and sets of candidate genes from across the genome. We validated this tool and tested its utility on three applications. First, using thousands of loci identified by GWA studies, our framework identifies the number of disease-associated genes that have enriched expression in the disease-affected tissue. Second, we experimentally confirmed an underappreciated prediction highlighted by our tool: variation in skin expressed genes are a major quantitative genetic modulator of white blood cell count - a trait considered to be a feature of the immune system. Finally, using gene lists derived from sequencing data, we show that human genes under constrained selective pressure are disproportionately expressed in nervous system tissues."
10.1101/021832,"Eukaryotic chromosomes initiate DNA synthesis from multiple replication origins in a temporally specific manner during S phase. The replicative helicase Mcm2-7 functions in both initiation and fork progression and thus is an important target of regulation. Mcm4, a helicase subunit, possesses an unstructured regulatory domain that mediates control from multiple kinase signaling pathways, including the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK). Following replication stress in S phase, Dbf4 and Sld3, an initiation factor and essential target of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK), are targets of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 for inhibition of initiation from origins that have yet to be activated, so-called late origins. Here, whole genome DNA replication profile analysis is employed to access under various conditions the effect of mutations that alter the Mcm4 helicase regulatory domain and the Rad53 targets, Sld3 and Dbf4. Late origin firing occurs under genotoxic stress when the controls on Mcm4, Sld3 and Dbf4 are simultaneously eliminated. The regulatory domain of Mcm4 plays an important role in the timing of late origin firing, both in an unperturbed S phase and dNTP limitation. Furthermore, checkpoint control of Sld3 impacts fork progression under replication stress. This effect is parallel to the role of the Mcm4 regulatory domain in monitoring fork progression. Hypomorph mutations in sld3 are suppressed by a mcm4 regulatory domain mutation. Thus, in response cellular conditions, the functions executed by Sld3, Dbf4 and the regulatory domain of Mcm4 intersect to control origin firing and replication fork progression, thereby ensuring genome stability."
10.1101/021774,"Fungi and oomycetes include deep and diverse lineages of eukaryotic plant pathogens. The last 10 years have seen the sequencing of the genomes of a multitude of species of these so-called filamentous plant pathogens. Already, fundamental concepts have emerged. Filamentous plant pathogen genomes tend to harbor large repertoires of genes encoding virulence effectors that modulate host plant processes. Effector genes are not randomly distributed across the genomes but tend to be associated with compartments enriched in repetitive sequences and transposable elements. These findings have led to the \""two-speed genome\"" model in which filamentous pathogen genomes have a bipartite architecture with gene sparse, repeat rich compartments serving as a cradle for adaptive evolution. Here, we review this concept and discuss how plant pathogens are great model systems to study evolutionary adaptations at multiple time scales. We will also introduce the next phase of research on this topic."
10.1101/021758,"BackgroundThe miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinIONTM has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinIONTM system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences.\n\nResultsUsing R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using  universal primers.\n\nConclusionsAlthough nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinIONTM DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems."
10.1101/021790,"Cellular signalling processes can exhibit pronounced cell-to-cell variability in genetically identical cells. This affects how individual cells respond differentially to the same environmental stimulus. However, the origins of cell-to-cell variability in cellular signalling systems remain poorly understood. Here we measure the temporal evolution of phosphorylated MEK and ERK dynamics across populations of cells and quantify the levels of population heterogeneity over time using high-throughput image cytometry. We use a statistical modelling framework to show that upstream noise is the dominant factor causing cell-to-cell variability in ERK phosphorylation, rather than stochasticity in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of ERK. In particular, the cell-to-cell variability during sustained phosphorylation stems from random fluctuations in the background upstream signalling processes, while during transient phosphorylation, the heterogeneity is primarily due to noise in the intensity of the upstream signal(s). We show that the core MEK/ERK system uses kinetic proof-reading to faithfully and robustly transmits these variable inputs. The MAPK cascade thus propagates cell-to-cell variability at the population level, rather than attenuating or increasing it."

For proteins of unknown structure, distance constraints obtained from evolutionarily couplings between residue pairs are used to de novo predict all-atom 3D structures, often to good accuracy.

10.1101/021840,"Adult neurogenesis, generation of new functional cells in the mature central nervous system (CNS), has been documented in a number of diverse organisms, ranging from humans to invertebrates. However, the origin and evolution of this phenomenon is still poorly understood for many of the key phylogenetic groups. Echinoderms are one such phylum, positioned as a sister group to chordates within the monophyletic clade Deuterostomia. They are well known for the ability of their adult organs, including the CNS, to completely regenerate after injury. Nothing is known, however, about production of new cells in the nervous tissue under normal physiological conditions in these animals. In this study, we show that new cells are continuously generated in the mature radial nerve cord (RNC) of the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima. Importantly, this neurogenic activity is not evenly distributed, but is significantly more extensive in the lateral regions of the RNC than along the midline. Some of the new cells generated in the apical region of the ectoneural neuroepithelium leave their place of origin and migrate basally to populate the neural parenchyma. Gene expression analysis showed that generation of new cells in the adult sea cucumber CNS is associated with transcriptional activity of genes known to be involved in regulation of various aspects of neurogenesis in other animals. Further analysis of one of those genes, the transcription factor Myc showed that it is expressed, in some, but not all radial glial cells, suggesting heterogeneity of this CNS progenitor cell population in echinoderms."
10.1101/021907,"Despite the increasing opportunity to collect large-scale data sets for population genomic analyses, the use of high throughput sequencing to study populations of polyploids has seen little application. This is due in large part to problems associated with determining allele copy number in the genotypes of polyploid individuals (allelic dosage uncertainty-ADU), which complicates the calculation of important quantities such as allele frequencies. Here we describe a statistical model to estimate biallelic SNP frequencies in a population of autopolyploids using high throughput sequencing data in the form of read counts. We bridge the gap from data collection (using restriction enzyme based techniques [e.g., GBS, RADseq]) to allele frequency estimation in a unified inferential framework using a hierarchical Bayesian model to sum over genotype uncertainty. Simulated data sets were generated under various conditions for tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid populations to evaluate the models performance and to help guide the collection of empirical data. We also provide an implementation of our model in the R package O_SCPLOWPOLYFREQSC_SCPLOW and demonstrate its use with two example analyses that investigate (i) levels of expected and observed heterozygosity and (ii) model adequacy. Our simulations show that the number of individuals sampled from a population has a greater impact on estimation error than sequencing coverage. The example analyses also show that our model and software can be used to make inferences beyond the estimation of allele frequencies for autopolyploids by providing assessments of model adequacy and estimates of heterozygosity."
10.1101/021162,"Bacterial persistence is a phenomenon wherein small proportion of a bacterial population attains transient antibiotic tolerance likely by virtue of metabolic minimization. Type II Toxin-Antitoxin systems (TAs), small overlapping bicistronic negative auto-regulons, were recently shown to induce the persistence state. Maisonneuve et al., 2013 reported that TAs are activated by a regulatory cascade consisting of stochastic accumulation of ppGpp leading to accumulation of inorganic polyphosphate (polyP). PolyP supposedly is essential for Lon protease-dependent-degradation of antitoxins resulting in activation of toxins and induction of persistence phenotype. In contrast, using semi-quantitative primer extension, we show that transcriptional up-regulation of yefM/yoeB loci, one of the well characterized TAs of Escherichia coli, is independent of ppGpp and polyP. Similarly, we show that chromosome-encoded YoeB-dependent target mRNA cleavage is independent of polyP. Our results and meta-analysis of literature we conclude that the regulation of yefM/yoeB TAs is independent of ppGpp and polyP."
10.1101/021543,"BackgroundEvidence-based clinical practice relies on unbiased reporting of negative results. Meta-analysis of drug safety and efficacy across many clinical trials is difficult given the unconstrained nature of reasons that are provided to ClinicalTrials.gov to explain clinical trial terminations.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe scanned all trials in ClinicalTrials.gov marked with the \""terminated\"" status (N=3122), meaning the trial had been stopped before the scheduled end date. Under the current reporting framework, any number of reasons may be given for termination, and these need not conform to a controlled vocabulary. Here we develop a controlled vocabulary for trial termination, and map each terminated trial to as many as three vocabulary terms. Mapping to this \""ontology of termination\"" allows further analysis and conclusions. First, we identify the subset of terminated trials that ended citing safety concerns (6.2%) or failure to establish efficacy (10.8%), and were further able to stratify these rates across trials of different phases. Second, we examine termination reasons where a stricter data model could have preserved more evidentiary value, either because the data model was misused (7.6%) or because the given reason left unclear whether the decision to terminate was based on analysis of the data (74.9%, with 20.4% mentioning a decision-maker that may have had access to the data). Third, we show that imposing a controlled vocabulary of reasons for termination would avoid ambiguity and improve the evidentiary value of clinical trials.\n\nConclusionsWe encourage wider use of an \""ontology of termination\"" and propose four questions that should be posed on trial termination. These simple steps would promote transparency and enable ready access to negative trial results for meta-analysis."
10.1101/021881,"Within populations of cells, fate decisions are controlled by an indeterminate combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors. In the case of stem cells, the stem cell niche is believed to maintain \""stemness\"" through communication and interactions between the stem cells and one or more other cell-types that contribute to the niche conditions. To investigate the robustness of cell fate decisions in the stem cell hierarchy and the role that the niche plays, we introduce simple mathematical models of stem and progenitor cells, their progeny and their interplay in the niche. These models capture the fundamental processes of proliferation and differentiation and allow us to consider alternative possibilities regarding how niche-mediated signalling feedback regulates the niche dynamics. Generalised stability analysis of these stem cell niche systems enables us to describe the stability properties of each model. We find that although the number of feasible states depends on the model, their probabilities of stability in general do not: stem cell-niche models are stable across a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate that niche-mediated feedback increases the number of stable steady states, and show how distinct cell states have distinct branching characteristics. The ecological feedback and interactions mediated by the stem cell niche thus lend (surprisingly) high levels of robustness to the stem and progenitor cell population dynamics. Furthermore, cell-cell interactions are sufficient for populations of stem cells and their progeny to achieve stability and maintain homeostasis. We show that the robustness of the niche -- and hence of the stem cell pool in the niche -- depends only weakly, if at all, on the complexity of the niche make-up: simple as well as complicated niche systems are capable of supporting robust and stable stem cell dynamics."
10.1101/021980,"Transportation of livestock carries the risk of spreading foreign animal diseases, leading to costly public and private sector expenditures on disease containment and eradication. Livestock movement tracing systems in Europe, Australia and Japan have allowed epidemiologists to model the risks engendered by transportation of live animals and prepare responses designed to protect the livestock industry. Within the US, data on livestock movement is not sufficient for direct parameterization of models for disease spread, but network models that assimilate limited data provide a path forward in model development to inform preparedness for disease outbreaks in the US. Here, we develop a novel data stream, the information publicly reported by US livestock markets on the origin of cattle consigned at live auctions, and demonstrate the potential for estimating a national-scale network model of cattle movement. By aggregating auction reports generated weekly at markets in several states, including some archived reports spanning several years, we obtain a market-oriented sample of edges from the dynamic cattle transportation network in the US. We first propose a sampling framework that allows inference about shipments originating from operations not explicitly sampled and consigned at non-reporting livestock markets in the US, and we report key predictors that are influential in extrapolating beyond our opportunistic sample. As a demonstration of the utility gained from the data and fitted parameters, we model the critical role of market biosecurity procedures in the context of a spatially homogeneous but temporally dynamic representation of cattle movements following an introduction of a foreign animal disease. We conclude that auction market data fills critical gaps in our ability to model intrastate cattle movement for infectious disease dynamics, particularly with an ability to addresses the capacity of markets to amplify or control a livestock disease outbreak.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe have automated the collection of previously unavailable cattle movement data, allowing us to aggregate details on the origins of cattle sold at live-auction markets in the US. Using our novel dataset, we demonstrate potential to infer a complete dynamic transportation network that would drive disease transmission in models of potential US livestock epidemics."

10.1101/021972,"Understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is important for both biological research and public health applications. It has been widely demonstrated that statistical modeling provides a firm basis for inferring relevant epidemiological quantities from incidence and molecular data. However, the complexity of transmission dynamic models causes two challenges: Firstly, the likelihood function of the models is generally not computable and computationally intensive simulation-based inference methods need to be employed. Secondly, the model may not be fully identifiable from the available data. While the first difficulty can be tackled by computational and algorithmic advances, the second obstacle is more fundamental. Identifiability issues may lead to inferences which are more driven by the prior assumptions than the data themselves. We here consider a popular and relatively simple, yet analytically intractable model for the spread of tuberculosis based on classical IS6110 fingerprinting data. We report on the identifiability of the model, presenting also some methodological advances regarding the inference. Using likelihood approximations, it is shown that the reproductive value cannot be identified from the data available and that the posterior distributions obtained in previous work have likely been substantially dominated by the assumed prior distribution. Further, we show that the inferences are influenced by the assumed infectious population size which has generally been kept fixed in previous work. We demonstrate that the infectious population size can be inferred if the remaining epidemiological parameters are already known with sufficient precision."
10.1101/021964,"As populations spread into new territory, environmental heterogeneities can shape the population front and genetic composition. We study here the effect of one important building block of inhomogeneous environments, compact obstacles. With a combination of experiments, theory, and simulation, we show how isolated obstacles both create long-lived distortions of the front shape and amplify the effect of genetic drift. A system of bacteriophage T7 spreading on a spatially heterogeneous Escherichia coli lawn serves as an experimental model system to study population expansions. Using an inkjet printer, we create well-defined replicates of the lawn and quantitatively study the population expansion manifested in plaque growth. The transient perturbations of the plaque boundary found in the experiments are well described by a model in which the front moves with constant speed. Independent of the precise details of the expansion, we show that obstacles create a kink in the front that persists over large distances and is insensitive to the details of the obstacle's shape. The small deviations between experimental findings and the predictions of the constant speed model can be understood with a more general reaction-diffusion model, which reduces to the constant speed model when the obstacle size is large compared to the front width. Using this framework, we demonstrate that frontier alleles that just graze the side of an isolated obstacle increase in abundance, a phenomenon we call 'geometry-enhanced genetic drift', complementary to the founder effect associated with spatial bottlenecks. Bacterial range expansions around nutrient-poor barriers and stochastic simulations confirm this prediction, the latter highlight as well the effect of the obstacle on the genealogy of individuals at the front. We argue that related ideas and experimental techniques are applicable to a wide variety of more complex environments, leading to a better understanding of how environmental heterogeneities affect population range expansions."
10.1101/021931,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, influenced by both genetic and environmental variation, that can affect transcription and many organismal phenotypes. Although patterns of DNA methylation have been shown to differ between human populations, it remains to be determined whether epigenetic diversity mirrors the patterns observed for DNA polymorphisms or gene expression levels. We measured DNA methylation at 480,000 sites in 34 individuals from five diverse human populations in the Human Genome Diversity Panel, and analyzed these together with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression data. We found greater population-specificity of DNA methylation than of mRNA levels, which may be driven by the greater genetic control of methylation. This study provides insights into gene expression and its epigenetic regulation across populations and offers a deeper understanding of worldwide patterns of epigenetic diversity in humans."
10.1101/021923,"The adaptive immune system relies on the diversity of receptors expressed on the surface of B and T-cells to protect the organism from a vast amount of pathogenic threats. The proliferation and degradation dynamics of different cell types (B cells, T cells, naive, memory) is governed by a variety of antigenic and environmental signals, yet the observed clone sizes follow a universal power law distribution. Guided by this reproducibility we propose effective models of somatic evolution where cell fate depends on an effective fitness. This fitness is determined by growth factors acting either on clones of cells with the same receptor responding to specific antigens, or directly on single cells with no regards for clones. We identify fluctuations in the fitness acting specifically on clones as the essential ingredient leading to the observed distributions. Combining our models with experiments we characterize the scale of fluctuations in antigenic environments and we provide tools to identify the relevant growth signals in different tissues and organisms. Our results generalize to any evolving population in a fluctuating environment."
10.1101/022053,"We present, implement, and evaluate an approach to calculate the internode certainty and tree certainty on a given reference tree from a collection of partial gene trees. Previously, the calculation of these values was only possible from a collection of gene trees with exactly the same taxon set as the reference tree. An application to sets of partial gene trees requires mathematical corrections in the internode certainty and tree certainty calculations. We implement our methods in RAxML and test them on empirical data sets. These tests imply that the inclusion of partial trees does matter. However, in order to provide meaningful measurements, any data set should also include trees containing the full species set."
10.1101/022020,"How likely is it that a population escapes extinction through adaptive evolution? The answer to this question is of great relevance in conservation biology, where we aim at species rescue and the maintenance of biodiversity, and in agriculture and epidemiology, where we seek to hamper the emergence of pesticide or drug resistance. By reshuffling the genome, recombination has two antagonistic effects on the probability of evolutionary rescue: it generates and it breaks up favorable gene combinations. Which of the two effects prevails, depends on the fitness effects of mutations and on the impact of stochasticity on the allele frequencies. In this paper, we analyze a mathematical model for rescue after a sudden environmental change when adaptation is contingent on mutations at two loci. The analysis reveals a complex nonlinear dependence of population survival on recombination. We moreover find that, counterintuitively, a fast eradication of the wildtype can promote rescue in the presence of recombination. The model also shows that two-step rescue is not unlikely to happen and can even be more likely than single-step rescue (where adaptation relies on a single mutation), depending on the circumstances."
10.1101/022004,"Convergently evolved mole-rats (Mammalia, Rodentia) provide a fascinating model for studying convergent molecular evolution. Three genome sequences have recently been made available for the blind mole-rat (Nannospalax galili; Spalacidae; Muroidea)1, and the convergently evolved naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber; Heterocephalidae; Ctenohystrica)2 and its close relative the Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis; Bathyergidae; Ctenohystrica)3. In their genome paper1, Fang et al. evaluated convergent molecular evolution related to the subterranean life-style between the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat. One particularly striking result was the strong signal for amino acid convergence detected in the circadian rhythm CLOCK gene. Here I show that this unexpected result is erroneous because it is based on the use of the wrong sequence for the naked mole-rat, which has been mistakenly replaced by a sequence from a blind mole-rat. When the correct sequence is used, the evidence for convergent molecular evolution in this gene appears very limited."
10.1101/022038,"The brain matures with large quantitative changes in anatomy and function. Graph analysis of EEG has previously revealed increased connectivity between distant brain areas and a decrease in randomness and increased integration in the brain network with concurrent increased modularity. Comparisons of graph parameters across age groups, however, may be confounded with network degree distributions. Here, we analyzed graph parameters from minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs. MST graphs are constructed by selecting only the strongest available connections avoiding loops resulting in a backbone graph that is thought reflect the major qualitative properties of connectivity while allowing a better comparison across age groups by avoiding the degree distribution confound. EEG was recorded in a large (N=1500) population-based sample aged 5 to 71 years. Connectivity was assessed using Phase Lag Index to reduce effects of volume conduction. As previously reported, connectivity increased from childhood to adolescence, continuing to grow nonsignificantly into adulthood decreasing only after ~30 years of age. Leaf number, degree, degree correlation, maximum centrality from the MST graph indicated a pattern of increased integration and decreased randomness from childhood into early adulthood. The observed development in network topology suggested that maturation at the neuronal level is aimed to increase connectivity as well as increase integration of the brain network. We confirm that brain network connectivity shows quantitative changes across the life span, and additionally demonstrate parallel qualitative changes in the connectivity pattern."
10.1101/022012,"Antibiotic drug resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via bacterial conjugation in unicellular populations of bacteria. Consequently, the efficiency of antibiotics is limited and the expected \""grace period\"" of novel antibiotics is typically quite short. One of the mechanisms that allow the accelerated adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics is bacterial conjugation. However, bacterial conjugation is regulated by several biological factors, with one of the most important ones being repression and derepression.\n\nIn recent work, we have studied the effects that repression and de-repression on the mutation-selection balance of an HGT-enabled bacterial population in a static environment. Two of our main findings were that conjugation has a deleterious effect on the mean fitness of the population and that repression is expected to allow a restoration of the fitness cost due to plasmid hosting.\n\nHere, we consider the effect that conjugation-mediated HGT has on the speed of adaptation in a dynamic environment and the effect that repression will have on the dynamics of antibiotic drug resistance. We find that, the effect of repression is dynamic in its possible outcome, that a conjugators to non-conjugators phase transition exists in a dynamic landscape as we have previously found for a static landscape and we quantify the time required for a unicellular population to adapt to a new antibiotic in a periodically changing fitness landscape. Our results also confirmed that HGT accelerates adaptation for a population of prokaryotes which agrees with current knowledge, that HGT rates increase when a population is put under stress."
10.1101/021998,"The growing burden of antimicrobial resistance is one of the most challenging problems facing public health today, and understanding how our approaches for using antimicrobial drugs shapes future levels of resistance is crucial. Recently there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e. high dose) or more moderate (i.e. lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. Here we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population."
10.1101/022103,"We recently presented an estimate of the number of mutually discriminable olfactory stimuli at one trillion (1). Subjects were asked to sniff mixtures of molecules with increasing component overlap selected from a panel of 128 isointense structurally and perceptually diverse monomolecular odorants (2). We considered stimulus pairs discriminable when the majority of subjects could significantly discriminate them at p=0.05, a conventional statistical threshold given our sample size. From these empirical data, we estimated that human discriminative capacity exceeds one trillion olfactory stimuli. Several readers have pointed out that such extrapolations are sensitive to underlying assumptions about the chosen significance threshold (3) and the dimensionality of olfaction (4). It is important to note that any exponential function will be sensitive in this way, and the goal of our model was not to identify the exact number of discriminable olfactory stimuli, or even the exact mathematical bounds, but an estimate of the order of magnitude of human discriminatory power across a population of human subjects. This was not clearly stated in our paper, and we agree that contradictory references to a \""lower limit\"" and an \""upper bound\"" were confusing. The central argument in (4) is that our estimation method assumes that the dimensionality of olfactory space is large. We agree that the high-dimensional nature of olfaction is indeed an assumption, and we should have stated this explicitly in our paper (1). Even if we follow this logic of the models presented in (4), purely geometrical calculations show that our results hold if the dimensionality of olfactory representations is D[&ge;]25. The dimensionality of olfaction is a question of interest to everyone, and while we do not know for sure, all available evidence suggests that olfaction is a high-dimensional sense. The olfactory system is wired to keep information from the ~400 odorant receptors strictly separated, so it is plausible that olfaction operates at least in 400-dimensional space. This is an important topic of discussion in olfaction, and we welcome continued debate of the dimensionality of smell and how this impacts human olfactory perception."
10.1101/022046,"Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are widely used in Brain-Computer Interface applications and in neuroscience.\n\nNormal EEG activity is rich in background noise and therefore, in order to detect ERPs, it is usually necessary to take the average from multiple trials to reduce the effects of this noise.\n\nThe noise produced by EEG activity itself is not correlated with the ERP waveform and so, by calculating the average, the noise is decreased by a factor inversely proportional to the square root of N, where N is the number of averaged epochs.\n\nThis is the easiest strategy currently used to detect ERPs, which is based on calculating the average of each ERPs waveform, these waveforms being time-and phase-locked.\n\nIn this paper a new method called GW6 is proposed, which calculates the ERP using a mathematical method based only on Pearson's Correlation.\n\nThis results in a graph with the same time resolution as the classical ERP and which contains only positive peaks representing the increase -in consonance to the stimuli - in EEG signal correlation over all channels.\n\nThis new method is also useful for selectively identifying and highlighting any hidden components of the ERP response that are not phase-locked, and that are usually hidden in the standard and simple method based on the averaging of all the epochs.\n\nThese hidden components seem to be caused by variations (between each successive stimulus) of the ERP's inherent phase latency period (jitter), although the same stimulus across all EEG channels produces a reasonably constant phase.\n\nFor this reason, this new method could be very helpful to investigate these hidden components of the ERP response and to develop applications for scientific and medical purposes.\n\nMoreover, this new method is more resistant to EEG artifacts than the standard calculations of the average.\n\nThe method we are proposing can be directly used in the form of a process written in the well known Matlab programming language and can be easily and quickly written in any other software language."
10.1101/022061,"NACHT- and Leucine-Rich-Repeat-containing domain (NLR) proteins act as cytoplasmic sensors for pathogen- and danger-associated molecular patterns and are found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. In addition to having a small set of conserved NLRs, the genomes in some animal lineages contain massive expansions of this gene family. One of these arose in fishes, after the creation of a gene fusion that combined the core NLR domains with another domain used for immune recognition, the PRY/SPRY or B30.2 domain. We have analysed the expanded NLR gene family in zebrafish, which contains 368 genes, and studied its evolutionary history. The encoded proteins share a defining overall structure, but individual domains show different evolutionary trajectories. Our results suggest gene conversion homogenizes NACHT and B30.2 domain sequences among different gene subfamilies, however, the functional implications of its action remains unclear. The majority of the genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 4, interspersed with several other large multi-gene families, including a new family encoding proteins with multiple tandem arrays of Zinc fingers. This suggests that chromosome 4 may be a hotspot for rapid evolutionary change in zebrafish."
10.1101/022137,"Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a powerful tool for in-vivo examination of a variety of skin diseases. However, current use of RCM depends on qualitative examination by a human expert to look for specific features in the different strata of the skin. Developing approaches to quantify features in RCM imagery requires an automated understanding of what anatomical strata is present in a given en-face section. This work presents an automated approach using a bag of features approach to represent en-face sections and a logistic regression classifier to classify sections into one of four classes (stratum corneum, viable epidermis, dermal-epidermal junction and papillary dermis). This approach was developed and tested using a dataset of 308 depth stacks from 54 volunteers in two age groups (20-30 and 50-70 years of age). The classification accuracy on the test set was 85.6%. The mean absolute error in determining the interface depth for each of the stratum corneum/viable epidermis, viable epidermis/dermal-epidermal junction and dermal-epidermal junction/papillary dermis interfaces were 3.1 m, 6.0 m and 5.5 m respectively. The probabilities predicted by the classifier in the test set showed that the classifier learned an effective model of the anatomy of human skin."

These MS-based spatial proteomics experiments enable us to pinpoint the sub-cellular distribution of thousands of proteins in a specific system under controlled conditions. Recent advances in high-throughput MS methods have yielded a plethora of experimental spatial proteomics data for the cell biology community. Yet, there are many third-party data sources, such as immunofluorescence microscopy or protein annotations and sequences, which represent a rich and vast source of complementary information. We present a unique transfer learning classification framework that utilises a nearest-neighbour or support vector machine system, to integrate heterogeneous data sources to considerably improve on the quantity and quality of sub-cellular protein assignment. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithms through evaluation of five experimental datasets, from four different species in conjunction with four different auxiliary data sources to classify proteins to tens of sub-cellular compartments with high generalisation accuracy. We further apply the method to an experiment on pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to classify a set of previously unknown proteins, and validate our findings against a recent high resolution map of the mouse stem cell proteome.

Interpregnancy interval average of each cohort of same neonates sex and mothers parity, but different configuration of preceding pregnancies, were measured and compared.\n\nResultsA positive association was found between mothers preceding pregnancies and length of interpregnancy interval when current pregnancy and preceding pregnancy were of the same sex, and a negative association when they were of opposite sex.\n\nDiscussionInterpregnancy interval length follows a pattern regarding the gravidas preceding pregnancy similar to the other early life indicators pattern, birth weight, placenta weight, gestation length and neonatal survival. Our results confirm and complete an immunological explanation of the indicators variations associated to the gravidas preceding pregnancy."
10.1101/022145,"We explore solutions for identifying and reconciling taxonomic concepts that take advantage of the powers of computational representation and reasoning without compromising the suitability of the Linnaean system of nomenclature for human communication. Using the model of the semiotic triangle, we show that taxonomic names must variously achieve reference to nomenclatural types, taxonomic concepts (human-created theories of taxonomic identities), and taxa (evolutionary entities in nature). Expansion of the reference models into temporally transitioning systems shows that the elements of each triangle, and provenance among elements across triangles, are only identifiable if taxonomic names and concepts are precisely contextualized. The Codes of nomenclature, by mandating identifier (name) reuse but not requiring concept-specific identifier granularity, leave the challenge of framing and aligning the symbol/reference instances to human communicators who have superior cognitive abilities in this regard. Computers, in turn, can process greater volumes of narrowly framed and logically aligned data. Comparative, taxonomically referenced biological data are becoming increasingly networked and reutilized in analyses that expand their original context of generation. If we expect our virtual comparative information environments to provide logically enabled taxonomic concept provenance services, then we must improve the syntax and semantics of human taxonomy making - for computers."
10.1101/022178,"Despite decades of research assessing the genetic structure of natural populations, the biological meaning of low yet significant genetic divergence often remains unclear due to a lack of associated phenotypic and ecological information. At the same time, structured populations with low genetic divergence and overlapping boundaries can potentially provide excellent models to study adaptation and reproductive isolation in cases where high resolution genetic markers and relevant phenotypic and life history information are available. Here, we combined SNP-based population inference with extensive phenotypic and life history data to identify potential biological mechanisms driving fine scale sub-population differentiation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from the Teno River, a major salmon river in Europe. Two sympatrically occurring sub-populations had low but significant genetic differentiation (FST = 0.018) and displayed marked differences in the distribution of life history strategies, including variation in juvenile growth rate, age at maturity and size within age classes. Large, late-maturing individuals were virtually absent from one of the two sub-populations and there were significant differences in juvenile growth rates and size-at-age after oceanic migration between individuals in the respective sub-populations. Our findings suggest that different evolutionary processes affect each sub-population and that hybridization and subsequent selection may maintain low genetic differentiation without hindering adaptive divergence."
10.1101/022160,"Cultural transmission of reproductive success states that successful men have more children and pass this raised fecundity to their offspring. Balaresque and colleagues found high frequency haplotypes in a Central Asian Y chromosome dataset, which they attribute to cultural transmission of reproductive success by prominent historical men, including Genghis Khan. Using coalescent simulation, we show that these high frequency haplotypes are consistent with a neutral model, where they commonly appear simply by chance. Hence, explanations invoking cultural transmission of reproductive success are statistically unnecessary."

10.1101/022079,"Plants and animals rely on immune receptors, known as nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NB-LRR or NLR), to defend against invading pathogens and activate immune responses. How NLR receptors respond to pathogens is inadequately understood. We previously reported single-residue mutations that expand the response of the potato immune receptor R3a to AVR3aEM, a stealthy effector from the late blight oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. I2, another NLR that mediates resistance to the wilt causing fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, is the tomato ortholog of R3a. We transferred previously identified R3a mutations to I2 to assess the degree to which the resulting I2 mutants have an altered response. We discovered that wild-type I2 protein responds weakly to AVR3a. One mutant in the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, I2I141N, appeared sensitized and displayed markedly increased response to AVR3a. Remarkably, I2I141N conferred partial resistance to P. infestans. Further, I2I141N has an expanded response spectrum to F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici effectors compared to the wild-type I2 protein. Our results suggest that synthetic immune receptors can be engineered to confer resistance to phylogenetically divergent pathogens and indicate that knowledge gathered for one NLR could be exploited to improve NLRs from other plant species."

10.1101/022251,"Development is a process that needs to tightly coordinated in both space and time. Cell tracking and lineage tracing have become important experimental techniques in developmental biology and allow us to map the fate of cells and their progeny in both space and time. A generic feature of developing (as well as homeostatic) tissues that these analyses have revealed is that relatively few cells give rise to the bulk of the cells in a tissue; the lineages of most cells come to an end fairly quickly. This has spurned the interest also of computational and theoretical biologists/physicists who have developed a range of modelling - perhaps most notably are the agent-based modelling (ABM) -- approaches. These can become computationally prohibitively expensive but seem to capture some of the features observed in experiments. Here we develop a complementary perspective that allows us to understand the dynamics leading to the formation of a tissue (or colony of cells). Borrowing from the rich population genetics literature we develop genealogical models of tissue development that trace the ancestry of cells in a tissue back to their most recent common ancestors. We apply this approach to tissues that grow under confined conditions -- as would, for example, be appropriate for the neural crest -- and unbounded growth -- illustrative of the behaviour of 2D tumours or bacterial colonies. The classical coalescent model from population genetics is readily adapted to capture tissue genealogies for different models of tissue growth and development. We show that simple but universal scaling relationships allow us to establish relationships between the coalescent and different fractal growth models that have been extensively studied in many different contexts, including developmental biology. Using our genealogical perspective we are able to study the statistical properties of the processes that give rise to tissues of cells, without the need for large-scale simulations."
10.1101/022202,"Populations facing novel environments can persist by adapting. In nature, the ability to adapt and persist will depend on interactions between coexisting individuals. Here we use an adaptive dynamic model to assess how the potential for evolutionary rescue is affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition (negative density-dependence) lowers abundance, which decreases the supply rate of beneficial mutations, hindering evolutionary rescue. On the other hand, interspecific competition can aid evolutionary rescue when it speeds adaptation by increasing the strength of selection. Our results clarify this point and give an additional requirement: competition must increase selection pressure enough to overcome the negative effect of reduced abundance. We therefore expect evolutionary rescue to be most likely in communities which facilitate rapid niche displacement. Our model, which aligns to previous quantitative and population genetic models in the absence of competition, provides a first analysis of when competitors should help or hinder evolutionary rescue."
10.1101/022236,"While eukaryotic and archaean genomes encode the histone fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Core histones assemble into a hetero-octamer rather than the homo-tetramer of Archaea. Thus it was unexpected that core histone \""doublets\"" were identified in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the Marseilleviridae (MV), one family of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV). Here we analyze the core histone doublet genes from all known Marseilleviridae genomes and show that they encode obligate H2B-H2A and H4-H3 dimers of likely proto-eukaryotic origin. Each MV core histone moiety forms a sister clade to a eukaryotic core histone clade inclusive of canonical core histone paralogs, suggesting that MV core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. We also show that all MV genomes encode a eukaryote-like DNA topoisomerase II enzyme that forms a clade that is sister to the eukaryotic clade. As DNA topo II influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones, we suggest MV genes underlie a proto-chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to diversification of eukaryotic core histone variants. Thus, combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses suggest that a primitive origin for MV chromatin genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + long-branch attraction constrained to each core histone clade. These results imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral DNA compaction, protection from host endonucleases, and/or other unknown processes associated with NCLDV-like progenitors."
10.1101/022269,"The ever-growing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed widespread pleiotropy. To exploit this, various methods which consider variant association with multiple traits jointly have been developed. However, most effort has been put on improving discovery power: how to replicate and interpret these discovered pleiotropic loci using multivariate methods has yet to be discussed fully. Using only multiple publicly available single-trait GWAS summary statistics, we develop a fast and flexible multi-trait framework that contains modules for (i) multi-trait genetic discovery, (ii) replication of locus pleiotropic profile, and (iii) multi-trait conditional analysis. The procedure is able to handle any level of sample overlap. As an empirical example, we discovered and replicated 23 novel pleiotropic loci for human anthropometry and evaluated their pleiotropic effects on other traits. By applying conditional multivariate analysis on the 23 loci, we discovered and replicated two additional multi-trait associated SNPs. Our results provide empirical evidence that multi-trait analysis allows detection of additional, replicable, highly pleiotropic genetic associations without genotyping additional individuals. The methods are implemented in a free and open source R package MultiABEL.\n\nAuthor summaryBy analyzing large-scale genomic data, geneticists have revealed widespread pleiotropy, i.e. single genetic variation can affect a wide range of complex traits. Methods have been developed to discover such genetic variants. However, we still lack insights into the relevant genetic architecture - What more can we learn from knowing the effects of these genetic variants?\n\nHere, we develop a fast and flexible statistical analysis procedure that includes discovery, replication, and interpretation of pleiotropic effects. The whole analysis pipeline only requires established genetic association study results. We also provide the mathematical theory behind the pleiotropic genetic effects testing.\n\nMost importantly, we show how a replication study can be essential to reveal new biology rather than solely increasing sample size in current genomic studies. For instance, we show that, using our proposed replication strategy, we can detect the difference in genetic effects between studies of different geographical origins.\n\nWe applied the method to the GIANT consortium anthropometric traits to discover new genetic associations, replicated in the UK Biobank, and provided important new insights into growth and obesity.\n\nOur pipeline is implemented in an open-source R package MultiABEL, sufficiently efficient that allows researchers to immediately apply on personal computers in minutes."

To identify genomic targets of adaptation, we sequenced the genomes of four Biaka Pygmies from the Central African Republic and jointly analyzed these data with the genome sequences of three Baka Pygmies from Cameroon and nine Yoruba famers. To account for the complex demographic history of these populations that includes both isolation and gene flow, we fit models using the joint allele frequency spectrum and validated them using independent approaches. Our two best-fit models both suggest ancient divergence between the ancestors of the farmers and Pygmies, 90,000 or 150,000 years ago. We also find that bi-directional asymmetric gene-flow is statistically better supported than a single pulse of unidirectional gene flow from farmers to Pygmies, as previously suggested. We then applied complementary statistics to scan the genome for evidence of selective sweeps and polygenic selection. We found that conventional statistical outlier approaches were biased toward identifying candidates in regions of high mutation or low recombination rate. To avoid this bias, we assigned P-values for candidates using whole-genome simulations incorporating demography and variation in both recombination and mutation rates. We found that genes and gene sets involved in muscle development, bone synthesis, immunity, reproduction, cell signaling and development, and energy metabolism are likely to be targets of positive natural selection in Western African Pygmies or their recent ancestors."
10.1101/022293,"Identifying the gene targets of distal regulatory sequences is a challenging problem with the potential to illuminate the causal underpinnings of complex diseases. However, current experimental methods to map enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide are limited by their cost and complexity. We present TargetFinder, a computational method that reconstructs a cells three-dimensional regulatory landscape from two-dimensional genomic features. TargetFinder achieves outstanding predictive accuracy across diverse cell lines with a false discovery rate up to fifteen times smaller than common heuristics, and reveals that distal regulatory interactions are characterized by distinct signatures of protein interactions and epigenetic marks on the DNA loop between an active enhancer and targeted promoter. Much of this signature is shared across cell types, shedding light on the role of chromatin organization in gene regulation and establishing TargetFinder as a method to accurately map long-range regulatory interactions using a small number of easily acquired datasets."
10.1101/022285,"When sequencing an ancient DNA sample from a hominin fossil, DNA from present-day humans involved in excavation and extraction will be sequenced along with the endogenous material. This type of contamination is problematic for downstream analyses as it will introduce a bias towards the population of the contaminating individual(s). Quantifying the extent of contamination is a crucial step as it allows researchers to account for possible biases that may arise in downstream genetic analyses. Here, we present an MCMC algorithm to co-estimate the contamination rate, sequencing error rate and demographic parameters - including drift times and admixture rates - for an ancient nuclear genome obtained from human remains, when the putative contaminating DNA comes from present-day humans. We assume we have a large panel representing the putative contaminant population (e.g. European, East Asian or African). The method is implemented in a C++ program called Demographic Inference with Contamination and Error (DICE). We applied it to simulations and genome data from ancient Neanderthals and modern humans. With reasonable levels of genome sequence coverage (> 3X), we find we can recover accurate estimates of all these parameters, even when the contamination rate is as high as 50%."
10.1101/022335,"Shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is a widely applicable tool for characterizing the functions that are encoded by microbial communities. Several bioinformatic tools can be used to functionally annotate metagenomes, allowing researchers to draw inferences about the functional potential of the community and to identify putative functional biomarkers. However, little is known about how decisions made during annotation affect the reliability of the results. Here, we use statistical simulations to rigorously assess how to optimize annotation accuracy and speed, given parameters of the input data like read length and library size. We identify best practices in metagenome annotation and use them to guide the development of the Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline (ShotMAP). ShotMAP is an analytically flexible, end-to-end annotation pipeline that can be implemented either on a local computer or a cloud compute cluster. We use ShotMAP to assess how different annotation databases impact the interpretation of how marine metagenome and metatranscriptome functional capacity changes across seasons. We also apply ShotMAP to data obtained from a clinical microbiome investigation of inflammatory bowel disease. This analysis finds that gut microbiota collected from Crohns disease patients are functionally distinct from gut microbiota collected from either ulcerative colitis patients or healthy controls, with differential abundance of metabolic pathways related to host-microbiome interactions that may serve as putative biomarkers of disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryMicrobial communities perform a wide variety of functions, from marine photosynthesis to aiding digestion in the human gut. Shotgun \""metagenomic\"" sequencing can be used to sample millions of short DNA sequences from such communities directly, without needing to first culture its constituents in the laboratory. Using these data, researchers can survey which functions are encoded by mapping these short sequences to known protein families and pathways. Several tools for this annotation already exist. But, annotation is a multi-step process that includes identification of genes in a metagenome and determination of the type of protein each gene encodes. We currently know little about how different choices of parameters during annotation influences the final results. In this work, we systematically test how several key decisions affect the accuracy and speed of annotation, and based on these results, develop new software for annotation, which we named ShotMAP. We then use ShotMAP to functionally characterize marine communities and gut communities in a clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease. We find several functions are differentially represented in the gut microbiome of Crohns disease patients, which could be candidates for biomarkers and could also offer insight into the pathophysiology of Crohns. ShotMAP is freely available (https://github.com/sharpton/shotmap)."
10.1101/022343,"With the growing number of protein structures in the protein data bank (PDB), there is a need to annotate these structures at the domain level in order to relate protein structure to protein function. Thanks to the SIFTS database, many PDB chains are now cross-referenced with Pfam domains and enzyme commission (EC) numbers. However, these annotations do not include any explicit relationship between individual Pfam domains and EC numbers. This article presents a novel statistical training-based method called EC-PSI that can automatically infer high confidence associations between EC numbers and Pfam domains directly from EC-chain associations from SIFTS and from EC-sequence associations from the SwissProt, and TrEMBL databases. By collecting and integrating these existing EC-chain/sequence annotations, our approach is able to infer a total of 8,329 direct EC-Pfam associations with an overall F-measure of 0.819 with respect to the manually curated InterPro database, which we treat here as a \""gold standard\"" reference dataset. Thus, compared to the 1,493 EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, our approach provides a way to find over six times as many high quality EC-Pfam associations completely automatically."
10.1101/022244,"When the ranges of two hybridizing species overlap, individuals may  waste gametes on inviable or infertile hybrids. In these cases, selection against maladaptive hybridization can lead to the evolution of enhanced reproductive isolation in a process called reinforcement. On the slopes of the African island of Sao Tome, Drosophila yakuba and its endemic sister species D. santomea have a well-defined hybrid zone. Drosophila yakuba females from within this zone show increased postmating-prezygotic isolation towards D. santomea males when compared with D. yakuba females from allopatric populations. To understand why reinforced gametic isolation is confined to areas of secondary contact and has not spread throughout the entire D. yakuba geographic range, we studied the costs of reinforcement in D. yakuba using a combination of natural collections and experimental evolution. We found that D. yakuba males from sympatric populations sire fewer progeny than allopatric males when mated to allopatric D. yakuba females. Our results suggest that the correlated evolution of male and female reproductive traits in sympatric D. yakuba have associated costs (i.e., reduced male fertility) that prevent the alleles responsible for enhanced isolation from spreading outside the hybrid zone."
10.1101/022368,"Scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout the scientific community. The number and type of journal publications also have become the primary criteria used in evaluating career advancement. Our analysis suggests that publication practices have changed considerably in the life sciences over the past thirty years. Considerably more experimental data is now required for publication, and the average time required for graduate students to publish their first paper has increased and is approaching the desirable duration of Ph.D. training. Since publication is generally a requirement for career progression, schemes to reduce the time of graduate student and postdoctoral training may be difficult to implement without also considering new mechanisms for accelerating communication of their work. The increasing time to publication also delays potential catalytic effects that ensue when many scientists have access to new information. The time has come for the life scientists, funding agencies, and publishers to discuss how to communicate new findings in a way that best serves the interests of the public and scientific community."
10.1101/022400,"Hybridization of distinct materials into a single nanoplatform is relevant to advance materials properties for functional application such as biosensor platform. We report the synthesis and characterization of nanosheets of graphene oxide decorated with hybrid nanoparticles of silver-ruthenium bipyridine complex (Ag@[Ru(bpy)3]2+) core and chitosan shell. Hybrid nanoparticles were first obtained through a sequential wet-chemical approach using in situ reduction, electrostatic and coordination reaction. Oxygenated functional groups of graphene oxide and abundant amine groups of chitosan layer on the surface of hybrid nanoparticles allowed the functionalization reaction. Changes in intrinsic optical, chemical and structural properties of graphene oxide due to hybrid nanoparticles were studied in depth using spectroscopic techniques and an electron microscope. Electrodes modified with nanosheets of graphene oxide-hybrid nanoparticles retain the biocompatibility and displayed an amplified redox property suitable for a broad range of sensing studies."
10.1101/022376,"Accurate estimation of the contrast transfer function (CTF) is critical for a near-atomic resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) reconstruction. Here, I present a GPU-accelerated computer program, Gctf, for accurate and robust, real-time CTF determination. Similar to alternative programs, the main target of Gctf is to maximize the cross-correlation of a simulated CTF with the power spectra of observed micrographs after background reduction. However, novel approaches in Gctf improve both speed and accuracy. In addition to GPU acceleration, a fast  1-dimensional search plus 2-dimensional refinement (1S2R) procedure significantly speeds up Gctf. Based on the global CTF determination, the local defocus for each particle and for single frames of movies is accurately refined, which improves CTF parameters of all particles for subsequent image processing. Novel diagnosis method using equiphase averaging(EFA) and self-consistency verification procedures have also been implemented in the program for practical use, especially for aims of near-atomic reconstruction. Gctf is an independent program and the outputs can be easily imported into other cryoEM software such as Relion and Frealign. The results from several representative datasets are shown and discussed in this paper."
10.1101/022384,"Variation in gene expression contributes to the diversity of phenotype. The construction of the pan-transcriptome is especially necessary for species with complex genomes, such as maize. However, knowledge of the regulation mechanisms and functional consequences of the pan-transcriptome is limited. In this study, we identified 13,382 nuclear expression presence and absence variation candidates (ePAVs, expressed in 5%~95% lines; based on the reference genome) by re-analyzing the RNA sequencing data from the kernels (15 days after pollination) of 368 maize diverse inbreds. It was estimated that only ~1% of the ePAVs are explained by DNA sequence presence and absence variations (PAV). The ePAV genes tend to be regulated by distant eQTLs when compared with non-ePAV genes (called here core expression genes, expressed in more than 95% lines). When the expression presence/absence status was used as the \"" genotype\"" to perform genome-wide association study, 56 (0.42%) ePAVs were significantly associated with 15 agronomic traits and 1,967 (14.74%) with 526 metabolic traits, measured from the mature kernels. While the above was majorly based on the reference genome, by using a modified  assemble-then-align strategy, 2,355 high confidence novel sequences with a total length of 1.9Mb were found absent in the current B73 reference genome (v2). Ten randomly selected novel sequences were validated with genomic PCR. A simulation analysis suggested that the pan-transcriptome of the maize whole kernel is approaching a maximum value of 63,000 genes. Two novel validated sequences annotated as NBS_LRR like genes were found to associate with flavonoid content and their homologs in rice were also found to affect flavonoids and disease-resistance. Novel sequences absent in the present reference genome might be functionally important and deserve more attentions. This study provides novel perspectives and resources to discover maize quantitative trait variations and help us to better understand the kernel regulation networks, thus enhancing maize breeding."
10.1101/022418,"While genome-wide significant associations generally explain only a small proportion of the narrow-sense heritability of complex disease (h2), recent work has shown that more heritability is explained by all genotyped SNPs (hg2). However, much of the heritability is still missing (hg2 < h2). For example, for schizophrenia, h2 is estimated at 0.7-0.8 but hg2 is estimated at [~]0.3. Efforts at increasing coverage through accurately imputed variants have yielded only small increases in the heritability explained, and poorly imputed variants can lead to assay artifacts for case-control traits. We propose to estimate the heritability explained by a set of haplotype variants (haploSNPs) constructed directly from the study sample (hhap2). Our method constructs a set of haplotypes from phased genotypes by extending shared haplotypes subject to the 4-gamete test. In a large schizophrenia data set (PGC2-SCZ), haploSNPs with MAF > 0.1% explained substantially more phenotypic variance (hhap2 = 0.64 (S.E. 0.084)) than genotyped SNPs alone (hg2 = 0.32 (S.E. 0.029)). These estimates were based on cross-cohort comparisons, ensuring that cohort-specific assay artifacts did not contribute to our estimates. In a large multiple sclerosis data set (WTCCC2-MS), we observed an even larger difference between hhap2 and hg2, though data from other cohorts will be required to validate this result. Overall, our results suggest that haplotypes of common SNPs can explain a large fraction of missing heritability of complex disease, shedding light on genetic architecture and informing disease mapping strategies."
10.1101/022459,"MotivationProtein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are essential for many biological processes, so understanding aspects of the sequence and structure in PRIs is important for understanding those processes. Due to the expensive and time-consuming processes required for experimental determination of complex protein-RNA structures, various computational methods have been developed to predict PRIs. However, most of these methods focus on predicting only RNA-binding regions in proteins or only protein-binding motifs in RNA. Methods for predicting entire residue-base contacts in PRIs have not yet achieved sufficient accuracy. Furthermore, some of these methods require 3D structures or homologous sequences, which are not available for all protein and RNA sequences.\n\nResultsWe propose a prediction method for residue-base contacts between proteins and RNAs using only sequence information and structural information predicted from only sequences. The method can be applied to any protein-RNA pair, even when rich information such as 3D structure is not available. Residue-base contact prediction is formalized as an integer programming problem. We predict a residue-base contact map that maximizes a scoring function based on sequence-based features such as k-mer of sequences and predicted secondary structure. The scoring function is trained by a max-margin framework from known PRIs with 3D structures. To verify our method, we conducted several computational experiments. The results suggest that our method, which is based on only sequence information, is comparable with RNA-binding residue prediction methods based on known binding data.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/satoken/practip.\n\nContactsatoken@bio.keio.ac.jp"
10.1101/022491,"The sequential changes occurring with cancer progression are now being harnessed with therapeutic intent. Yet, there is no understanding of the chemical thermodynamics of proteomic changes associated with cancer progression/cancer stage. This manuscript reveals a strong correlation of a chemical thermodynamic measure (known as Gibbs free energy) of protein-protein interaction networks for several cancer types and 5-year overall survival and stage in patients with cancer. Earlier studies have linked degree entropy of signaling networks to patient survival data, but not with stage. It appears that Gibbs free energy is a more general metric and accounts better for the underlying energetic landscape of protein expression in cells, thus correlating with stage as well as survival.\n\nThis is an especially timely finding because of improved ability to obtain and analyze genomic/proteomic information from individual patients. Yet, at least at present, only candidate gene imaging (FISH or immunohistochemistry) can be used for entropy computations. With continually expanding use of genomic information in clinical medicine, there is an ever-increasing need to understand the thermodynamics of protein-protein interaction networks."
10.1101/022434,"Protein tertiary structure prediction (PSP) is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. Different methods have been introduced to solve this problem so far, but PSP is computationally intensive and belongs to the NP-hard class. One of the best solutions to accelerate PSP is the use of a massively parallel processing architecture, such graphical processing unit (GPU), which is used to parallelize computational algorithms. In this paper, we have proposed a parallel architecture to accelerate PSP. A bio-inspired method, particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used as the optimization method to solve PSP. We have also performed a comprehensive study on implementing different topologies of PSO on GPU to consider the acceleration rate. Our solution belongs to ab-initio category which is based on the dihedral angles and calculates the energy-levels to predict the tertiary structure. Indeed, we have studied the search space of a protein to find the best pair of angles that gives the minimum free energy. A profile-level knowledge-based force field based on PSI-BLAST multiple sequence alignment has been applied as a fitness function to calculate the energy values. Different topologies and variations of PSO are considered here and the experimental results show that the speedup gain using GPU is about 34 times faster than CPU implementation of the algorithm with an acceptable precision. The energy values of predicted structures confirm the robustness of the algorithm."
10.1101/021857,"BackgroundCopy number variation (CNV) is a common feature of eukaryotic genomes, and a growing body of evidence suggests that genes affected by CNV are enriched in processes that are associated with environmental responses. Here we use next generation sequence (NGS) data to detect copy-number variable regions (CNVRs) within the Malus x domestica genome, as well as to examine their distribution and impact.\n\nMethodsCNVRs were detected using NGS data derived from 30 accessions of M. x domestica analyzed using the read-depth method, as implemented in the CNVrd2 software. To improve the reliability of our results, we developed a quality control and analysis procedure that involved checking for organelle DNA, not repeat masking, and the determination of CNVR identity using a permutation testing procedure.\n\nResultsOverall, we identified 876 CNVRs, which spanned 3.5% of the apple genome. To verify that detected CNVRs were not artifacts, we analyzed the B-allele-frequencies (BAF) within a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array dataset derived from a screening of 185 individual apple accessions and found the CNVRs were enriched for SNPs having aberrant BAFs (P < 1e-13, Fishers Exact test). Putative CNVRs overlapped 845 gene models and were enriched for resistance (R) gene models (P < 1e-22, Fishers exact test). Of note was a cluster of resistance gene models on chromosome 2 near a region containing multiple major gene loci conferring resistance to apple scab.\n\nConclusionWe present the first analysis and catalogue of CNVRs in the M. x domestica genome. The enrichment of the CNVRs with R gene models and their overlap with gene loci of agricultural significance draw attention to a form of unexplored genetic variation in apple. This research will underpin further investigation of the role that CNV plays within the apple genome."
10.1101/022442,"Exogenous cannabinoids can affect behaviorally relevant neuronal oscillations, but there is little evidence that endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids, eCBs) can affect them, although it is unknown whether eCBs were generated during oscillations investigated in previous studies. In rat hippocampal slices, muscarinic receptor (mAChR) agonists stimulate the occurrence of persistent, rhythmic inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSC) activity and mobilize eCBs. We tested the hypothesis that mAChR-induced IPSCs would be modulated by concomitantly produced eCBs. With ionotropic glutamate receptors inhibited, mAChR agonist application triggered eCB-sensitive IPSCs that were enhanced in amplitude and frequency when a cannabinoid receptor antagonist was also present. There was also a highly significant increase in IPSC spectral power in the theta-frequency range. The data show that eCBs released by mAChRs modulate rhythmic IPSCs, and suggest that eCBs are candidate regulators of neuronal oscillations associated with eCB production in vivo.\n\nSignificance statementEndocannabinoids (eCB) are ubiquitous and powerful modulators of neuronal activity, acting in the brain mainly via cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) on presynaptic nerve terminals, and inhibiting neurotransmitter release. Numerous neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine (ACh), stimulate eCB release. Behaviorally important neuronal oscillations can be suppressed by exogenous cannabinoids, suggesting that eCBs could regulate oscillations normally. Such regulation, if it occurred, would represent an important new dimension of eCB actions, but to date there is little evidence that eCBs do affect neuronal oscillations. Given the enrichment of eCBs and CB1Rs in brain regions whose behavioral roles depend on neuronal oscillations, including the hippocampus, it is important to understand whether, or how, the eCBs affect rhythms."
10.1101/022475,"Neuronal encoding and collective network activity depend on the precise mechanism for generating action potentials. A dynamic switch in this mechanism could greatly expand the functional repertoire of neurons and circuits. Here we show that changes in neuronal biophysics control a complex, yet fundamental, sequence of dynamic transitions in neuronal excitability in which neurons switch from integrators to resonators near the spike threshold, from simple voltage dynamics to the bistable co-existence of action potentials and quiescence, and from continuous class-I to discontinuous class-II firing rate encoding. Using multiple bifurcation theory, we prove that this transition sequence is universal in conductance-based neurons. Using dynamic-clamp and pharmacology, we show experimentally that an increase in leak conductance or application of the inhibitory agonist GABA can dynamically induce these transitions in hippocampal and brainstem neurons. Our results imply that synaptic activity can flexibly control resonance, excitability and bistability of neurons. In simulated neuronal networks, we show that such synaptically induced transitions provide a mechanism for the dynamic gating of input signals and the targeted synchronization of sub-networks with a tunable number of neurons.\n\nSignificanceNeuronal function depends on the mechanism by which neurons transform synaptic input into action potentials (APs). It is unclear how neurons might control the AP mechanism to systematically modulate their responses to input signals or their collective behavior. Here we identify a complex, but model-independent, universal sequence of transitions in the dynamics of AP generation. Using patch-clamp recordings, we show that synaptic receptor activation can flexibly change the AP dynamics, confirming our theoretical predictions: non-resonant neurons develop a sub-threshold resonance, become bistable, and develop an abrupt jump in onset AP frequency. Our results explain how synapses or neuro-modulators could control neuronal excitability, influence information processing, and processing during collective network dynamics."
10.1101/022467,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in pediatric and young adult patients. Successful treatment of osteosarcomas requires a combination of surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy, both neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery). The degree of necrosis following neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates with the subsequent probability of disease-free survival. Tumors with less than 10% of viable cells after treatment represent patients with a more favorable prognosis. However, being able to predict early, such as at the time of the pre-treatment tumor biopsy, how the patient will respond to the standard chemotherapy would provide an opportunity for more personalized patient care. Patients with unfavorable predictions could be studied in a protocol, rather than a standard setting, towards improving therapeutic success. The onset of necrotic cells in osteosarcomas treated with chemotherapeutic agents is a measure of tumor sensitivity to the drugs. We hypothesize that the remaining viable cells, i.e., cells that have not responded to the treatment, are chemoresistant, and that the pathological characteristics of these chemoresistant tumor cells within the osteosarcoma pre-treatment biopsy can predict tumor response to the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic treatment. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing patient histopathology samples before, as well as after treatment to identify both morphological and immunochemical cellular features that are characteristic of chemoresistant cells, i.e., cells that survived treatment. Consequently, using computational simulations of dynamic changes in tumor pathology under the simulated standard of care chemotherapeutic treatment, one can couple the pre- and post-treatment morphological and spatial patterns of chemoresistant cells, and correlate them with patient clinical diagnoses. This procedure, that we named  Virtual Clinical Trials, can serve as a potential predictive biomarker providing a novel value added decision support tool for oncologists."
10.1101/022525,"The essential biological properties of proteins - folding, biochemical activities, and the capacity to adapt - arise from the global pattern of interactions between amino acid residues. The statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is an approach to defining this pattern that involves the study of amino acid coevolution in an ensemble of sequences comprising a protein family. This approach indicates a functional architecture within proteins in which the basic units are coupled networks of amino acids termed sectors. This evolution-based decomposition has potential for new understandings of the structural basis for protein function, but requires broad further testing by the scientific community. To facilitate this, we present here the principles and practice of the SCA and introduce new methods for sector analysis in a python-based software package. We show that the pattern of amino acid interactions within sectors is linked to the divergence of functional lineages in a multiple sequence alignment - a model for how sector properties might be differentially tuned in members of a protein family. This work provides new tools for understanding the structural basis for protein function and for generally testing the concept of sectors as the principal functional units of proteins."
10.1101/022533,"Plant communities provide floral resource-landscapes for pollinators. Yet, it is insufficiently understood how these landscapes shape pollinator-mediated interactions among multiple plant species. Here, we study how pollinators and the seed set of plants respond to the distribution of a floral resource (nectar sugar) in space and across plant species, inflorescences and flowering phenologies. In a global biodiversity hotspot, we quantified floral resource-landscapes on 27 sites of 4 ha comprising 127,993 shrubs of 19 species. Visitation rates of key bird pollinators strongly depended on the phenology of site-scale resource amounts. Seed set of focal plants increased with resources of conspecific neighbours and with site-scale resources, notably with heterospecific resources of lower quality (less sugar per inflorescence). Floral resources are thus a common currency determining how multiple plant species interact via pollinators. These interactions may alter conditions for species coexistence in plant communities and cause community-level Allee effects that promote extinction cascades."
10.1101/022566,"Populations of species in ecosystems are often constrained by availability of resources within their environment. In effect this means that a growth of one population, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of others. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change incrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we propose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe collapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of bacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an important role.\n\nThe emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic \""diversity waves\"" triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced species, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the current wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several smaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in the rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies."
10.1101/022574,"The site frequency spectrum (SFS) and other genetic summary statistics are at the heart of many population genetics studies. Previous studies have shown that human populations had undergone a recent epoch of fast growth in effective population size. These studies assumed that growth is exponential, and the ensuing models leave unexplained excess amount of extremely rare variants. This suggests that human populations might have experienced a recent growth with speed faster than exponential. Recent studies have introduced a generalized growth model where the growth speed can be faster or slower than exponential. However, only simulation approaches were available for obtaining summary statistics under such models. In this study, we provide expressions to accurately and efficiently evaluate the SFS and other summary statistics under generalized models, which we further implement in a publicly available software. Investigating the power to infer deviation of growth from being exponential, we observed that decent sample sizes facilitate accurate inference, e.g. a sample of 3000 individuals with the amount of data expected from exome sequencing allows observing and accurately estimating growth with speed deviating by 10% or more from that of exponential. Applying our inference framework to data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, we found that a model with a generalized growth epoch fits the observed SFS significantly better than the equivalent model with exponential growth (p-value = 3.85 x 10-6). The estimated growth speed significantly deviates from exponential (p-value << 10-12), with the best-fit estimate being of growth speed 12% faster than exponential."
10.1101/022657,"The social hymenoptera are emerging as models for epigenetics. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group, is a common epigenetic marker. In mammals and flowering plants methylation affects allele specific expression. There is contradictory evidence for the role of methylation on allele specific expression in social insects. The aim of this paper is to investigate allele specific expression and monoallelic methylation in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We found nineteen genes that were both monoallelically methylated and monoallelically expressed in a single bee. Fourteen of these genes express the hypermethylated allele, while the other five express the hypomethylated allele. We also searched for allele specific expression in twenty-nine published RNA-seq libraries. We found 555 loci with allele-specific expression. We discuss our results with reference to the functional role of methylation in gene expression in insects and in the, as yet unquantified, role of genetic cis effects in insect allele specific methylation and expression."
10.1101/022632,"Previous research reported that Papua New Guineans (PNG) and Australians contain introgressions from Denisovans. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of Denisovan introgressions in PNG and Australians. We firstly developed a two-phase method to detect Denisovan introgressions from whole-genome sequencing data. This method has relatively high detection power (79.74%) and low false positive rate (2.44%) based on simulations. Using this method, we identified 1.34 Gb of Denisovan introgressions from sixteen PNG and four Australian genomes, in which we identified 38,877 Denisovan introgressive alleles (DIAs). We found that 78 Denisovan introgressions were under positive selection. Genes located in the 78 introgressions are related to evolutionarily important functions, such as spermatogenesis, fertilization, cold acclimation, circadian rhythm, development of brain, neural tube, face, and olfactory pit, immunity, etc. We also found that 121 DIAs are missense. Genes harboring the 121 missense DIAs are also related to evolutionarily important functions, such as female pregnancy, development of face, lung, heart, skin, nervous system, and male gonad, visual and smell perception, response to heat, pain, hypoxia, and UV, lipid transport, metabolism, blood coagulation, wound healing, aging, etc. Taken together, this study suggests that Denisovan introgressions in PNG and Australians are evolutionarily important, and may help PNG and Australians in local adaptation. In this study, we also proposed a method that could efficiently identify archaic hominin introgressions in modern non-African genomes."
10.1101/022608,"Cell identity (or cell state) is established via gene expression programs, represented by \""associated genes\"" with dynamic expression across cell identities. Here we integrate RNA-seq data from 40 tissues and cell types from human, chimpanzee, bonobo, and mouse to investigate the conservation and differentiation of cell states. We employ a statistical tool, \""Transcriptome Overlap Measure\"" (TROM) to first identify cell-state-associated genes, both protein-coding and non-coding. Next, we use TROM to comprehensively map the cell states within each species and also between species based on the cell-state-associated genes. The within-species mapping measures which cell states are similar to each other, allowing us to construct a human cell differentiation tree that recovers both known and novel lineage relationships between cell states. Moreover, the between-species mapping summarizes the conservation of cell states across the four species. Based on these results, we identify conserved associated genes for different cell states and annotate their biological functions. Interestingly, we find that neural and testis tissues exhibit distinct evolutionary signatures in which neural tissues are much less enriched in conserved associated genes than testis. In addition, our mapping demonstrate that besides protein-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs serve well as associated genes to indicate cell states. We further infer the biological functions of those non-coding associated genes based on their co-expressed protein-coding associated genes.

10.1101/022665,"A dominant approach to genetic association studies is to perform univariate tests between genotype-phenotype pairs. However, analysing related traits together increases statistical power, and certain complex associations become detectable only when several variants are tested jointly. Currently, modest sample sizes of individual cohorts and restricted availability of individual-level genotype-phenotype data across the cohorts limit conducting multivariate tests.\n\nWe introduce metaCCA, a computational framework for summary statistics-based analysis of a single or multiple studies that allows multivariate representation of both genotype and phenotype. It extends the statistical technique of canonical correlation analysis to the setting where original individual-level records are not available, and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness.\n\nMultivariate meta-analysis of two Finnish studies of nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics by metaCCA, using standard univariate output from the program SNPTEST, shows an excellent agreement with the pooled individual-level analysis of original data. Motivated by strong multivariate signals in the lipid genes tested, we envision that multivariate association testing using metaCCA has a great potential to provide novel insights from already published summary statistics from high-throughput phenotyping technologies.\n\nCode is available at https://github.com/aalto-ics-kepaco."
10.1101/022616,"MotivationNext generation sequencing technologies have provided us with a wealth of information on genetic variation, but predicting the functional significance of this variation is a difficult task. While many comparative genomics studies have focused on gene flux and large scale changes, relatively little attention has been paid to quantifying the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels on protein function, particularly in bacterial genomics.\n\nResultsWe present a hidden Markov model based approach we call delta-bitscore (DBS) for identifying orthologous proteins that have diverged at the amino acid sequence level in a way that is likely to impact biological function. We benchmark this approach with several widely used datasets and apply it to a proof-of-concept study of orthologous proteomes in an investigation of host adaptation in Salmonella enterica. We highlight the value of the method in identifying functional divergence of genes, and suggest that this tool may be a better approach than the commonly used dN/dS metric for identifying functionally significant genetic changes occurring in recently diverged organisms.\n\nAvailabilityA program implementing DBS for pairwise genome comparisons is freely available at: https://github.com/UCanCompBio/deltaBS.\n\nContactnicole.wheeler@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, lars.barquist@uni-wuerzburg.de\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at BioRxiv online."
10.1101/022699,"Pathogens and the diseases they cause have been among the most important selective forces experienced by humans during their evolutionary history. Although adaptive alleles generally arise by mutation, introgression can also be a valuable source of beneficial alleles. Archaic humans, who lived in Europe and Western Asia for over 200,000 years, were likely well-adapted to the environment and its local pathogens, and it is therefore conceivable that modern humans entering Europe and Western Asia who admixed with them obtained a substantial immune advantage from the introgression of archaic alleles.\n\nHere we document a cluster of three toll-like receptors (TLR6-TLR1-TLR10) in modern humans that carries three distinct archaic haplotypes, indicating repeated introgression from archaic humans. Two of these haplotypes are most similar to Neandertal genome, while the third haplotype is most similar to the Denisovan genome. The toll-like receptors are key components of innate immunity and provide an important first line of immune defense against bacteria, fungi and parasites. The unusually high allele frequencies and unexpected levels of population differentiation indicate that there has been local positive selection on multiple haplotypes at this locus. We show that the introgressed alleles have clear functional effects in modern humans; archaic-like alleles underlie differences in the expression of the TLR genes and are associated with reduced microbial resistance and increased allergic disease in large cohorts. This provides strong evidence for recurrent adaptive introgression at the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 locus, resulting in differences in disease phenotypes in modern humans."
10.1101/022806,"Cancer arises from accumulation of somatic mutations and accompanying evolutionary selection for growth advantage. During the evolutionary process, an ancestor clone branches into multiple clones, yielding intratumor heterogeneity. However, principles underlying intratumor heterogeneity have been poorly understood. Here, to explore the principles, we built a cellular automaton model, termed the BEP model, which can reproduce the branching cancer evolution in silico. We then extensively searched for conditions leading to high intratumor heterogeneity by performing simulations with various parameter settings on a supercomputer. Our result suggests that multiple driver genes of moderate strength can shape subclonal structures by positive natural selection. Moreover, we found that high mutation rate and a stem cell hierarchy can contribute to extremely high intratumor heterogeneity, which is characterized by fractal patterns, through neutral evolution. Collectively, This study identified the possible principles underlying intratumor heterogeneity, which provide novel insights into the origin of cancer robustness and evolvability."
10.1101/022756,"The Eph receptors and their cognate ephrin ligands play key roles in many aspects of nervous system development. These interactions typically occur within an individual tissue type, serving either to guide axons to their terminal targets or to define boundaries between the rhombomeres of the hindbrain. We have identified a novel role for the Caenorhabditis elegans ephrin EFN-4 in promoting primary neurite outgrowth in AIY interneurons and D-class motor neurons. Rescue experiments reveal that EFN-4 functions non-cell autonomously in the epidermis to promote primary neurite outgrowth. We also find that EFN-4 plays a role in promoting ectopic axon branching in a C. elegans model of X-linked Kallmann syndrome. In this context, EFN-4 functions non-cell autonomously in the body wall muscle, and in parallel with HS biosynthesis genes and HSPG core proteins, which function cell autonomously in the AIY neurons. This is the first report of an epidermal ephrin providing a developmental cue to the nervous system."

Analysis of NOS2A_(CCTTT)n markers evidenced differences between patients and healthy controls. A preferential presence of the (CCTTT)8 (P=0.02; OR=1.71, 95%CI=1.07-2.74), (CCTTT)14 (P=0.02; OR=1.71, 95%CI=1.06-2.76) alleles in IBD, (CCTTT)8 (P=0.008; OR=1.95, 95%CI=1.17-3.23) in CD and (CCTTT)7 (P=0.009; OR = 7.61, 95%CI=1.25-46.08), (CCTTT)11 (P=0.05 ; OR= 0.51, 95%CI=0.25-1.01), (CCTTT)14 (P=0.02 ; OR= 2.05, 95%CI=1.07-3.94), (CCTTT)15 (P=0.01 ; OR= 2.25, 95%CI=1.16-4.35) repeats in UC patients indicated its possible association with higher disease risk which need to be confirmed in a larger sample size.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that the NOS2A_(CCTTT)n gene variations may influence IBD susceptibility in the Moroccan population."

Rapidly emerging large-scale RNA and DNA sequences make studying CUB in many species feasible. Existing software however is limited in incorporating the new data resources. Therefore, I release the software CUA which can compute all popular CUB metrics, including CAI, tAI, Fop, ENC. More importantly, CUA allows users to incorporate user-specific data, such as tRNA abundance and highly expressed genes from considered tissues; this flexibility enables computing CUB metrics for any species with improved accuracy. In sum, CUA eases codon usage studies and establishes a platform for incorporating new metrics in future.

10.1101/022780,"MotivationThere are many tools for variant calling and effect prediction, but little to tie together large sample groups. Aggregating, sorting, and summarizing variants and effects across a cohort is often done with ad hoc scripts that must be re-written for every new project. In response, we have written MuCor, a tool to gather variants from a variety of input formats (including multiple files per sample), perform database lookups and frequency calculations, and write many report types. In addition to use in large studies with numerous samples, MuCor can also be employed to directly compare variant calls from the same sample across two or more platforms, parameters, or pipelines. A companion utility, DepthGauge, measures coverage at regions of interest to increase confidence in calls.\n\nAvailabilitySource code is freely available at https://github.com/blachlylab\n\nContactjames.blachly@osumc.edu\n\nSupplementary dataSupplementary data, including detailed documentation, are available online."
10.1101/022707,"When reporting research findings, scientists document the steps they followed so that others can verify and build upon the research. When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. Due to the deterministic nature of most computer programs, the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced due to complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed--and due to limitations in how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges. Here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as circumstances under which each might be applied. No single strategy is sufficient for every scenario; thus we emphasize that it is often useful to combine approaches."

10.1101/022830,"Meiotic recombination initiated by programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) yields two types of interhomolog recombination products, crossovers and noncrossovers, but what determines whether a DSB will yield a crossover or noncrossover is not understood. In this study we analyze the influence of sex and chromosomal location on mammalian recombination outcomes by constructing fine-scale recombination maps in both males and females at two mouse hotspots located in different regions of the same chromosome. These include the most comprehensive maps of recombination hotspots in oocytes to date. One hotspot, located centrally on chromosome 1, behaved similarly in male and female meiosis: crossovers and noncrossovers formed at comparable levels and ratios in both sexes. In contrast, at a distal hotspot crossovers were recovered only in males even though noncrossovers were obtained at similar frequencies in both sexes. These findings reveal an example of extreme sex-specific bias in recombination outcome. We further find that estimates of relative DSB levels are surprisingly poor predictors of relative crossover frequencies between hotspots in males. Our results demonstrate that the outcome of mammalian meiotic recombination can be biased, that this bias can vary depending on location and cellular context, and that DSB frequency is not the only determinant of crossover frequency."
10.1101/022723,"British population history has been shaped by a series of immigrations and internal movements, including the early Anglo-Saxon migrations following the breakdown of the Roman administration after 410CE. It remains an open question how these events affected the genetic composition of the current British population. Here, we present whole-genome sequences generated from ten ancient individuals found in archaeological excavations close to Cambridge in the East of England, ranging from 2,300 until 1,200 years before present (Iron Age to Anglo-Saxon period). We use present-day genetic data to characterize the relationship of these ancient individuals to contemporary British and other European populations. By analyzing the distribution of shared rare variants across ancient and modern individuals, we find that todays British are more similar to the Iron Age individuals than to most of the Anglo-Saxon individuals, and estimate that the contemporary East English population derives 30% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon migrations, with a lower fraction in Wales and Scotland. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal, which fits a demographic model to the distribution of shared rare variants across a large number of samples, enabling fine scale analysis of subtle genetic differences and yielding explicit estimates of population sizes and split times. Using rarecoal we find that the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxon samples are closest to modern Danish and Dutch populations, while the Iron Age samples share ancestors with multiple Northern European populations including Britain."
10.1101/022731,"Next-generation sequencing projects commonly commence by aligning reads to a reference genome assembly. While improvements in alignment algorithms and computational hardware have greatly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of alignments, a significant percentage of reads often remain unmapped. We generated de novo assemblies of unmapped reads from the DNA and RNA sequencing of the Bos taurus reference individual and identified the closest matching sequence to each contig by alignment to the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database using BLAST. As expected, many of these contigs represent vertebrate sequence that is absent, incomplete, or misassembled in the UMD3.1 reference assembly. However, numerous additional contigs represent invertebrate species. Most prominent were several species of Spirurid nematodes and a blood-borne parasite, Babesia bigemina. These species are not known to infect taurine cattle and the reference animal appears to have been host to unsequenced sister species. We demonstrate the importance of exploring unmapped reads to ascertain sequences that are either absent or misassembled in the reference assembly and for detecting sequences indicative of infectious or symbiotic organisms."
10.1101/022673,"Genomic selection is an accurate and efficient method of estimating genetic merits by using high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).In this study, we investigate an approach to increase the efficiency of genomic prediction by using genome-wide markers. The approach is a feature selection based on genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP),which is a statistical method used to predict breeding values using SNPs for selection in animal and plant breeding. The objective of this study is the choice of kinship matrix for genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP).The G-matrix is using the information of genome-wide dense markers. We compare three kinds of kinships based on different combinations of centring and scaling of marker genotypes. And find a suitable kinship approach that adjusts for the resource population of Chinese Simmental beef cattle. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) can be used to estimate kinship matrix and individual inbreeding coefficients more accurately. So in our research a genomic relationship matrix was developed for 1059 Chinese Simmental beef cattle using 640000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and breeding values were estimated using phenotypes about Carcass weight and Sirloin weight. The number of SNPs needed to accurately estimate a genomic relationship matrix was evaluated in this population. Another aim of this study was to optimize the selection of markers and determine the required number of SNPs for estimation of kinship in the Chinese Simmental beef cattle.\n\nWe find that the feature selection of GBLUP using Xus and the Astle and Baldings kinships model performed similarly well, and were the best-performing methods in our study.

10.1101/022764,"Cattle diverged during the Pleistocene into two subspecies, one in temperate and one in tropical environments. Here we have used next generation sequencing of the indicine subspecies of cattle and compared it to the taurine subspecies. Although 23.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were found, the number of fixed amino acid substitutions between the taurine and indicine subspecies was low and consistent with the Haldane predictions for adaptive selection rather than with Neutral Theory. We noted 33 regions of enhanced divergence of nonsynonymous SNP between the subspecies, which included an increased rate of deleterious variants. Signals of positive selection were found for genes associated with immunity, including the Bovine Major Histocompatibility Complex, which also showed an increased rate of deleterious amino acid variants. The genes important in sensing the environment, especially the olfactory system, showed a network wide signal of positive selection."
10.1101/022772,"Engineered RNAs have become integral components of the synthetic biology and bioengineering toolbox for controlling gene expression. We recently expanded this toolbox by creating small transcription activating RNAs (STARs) that act by disrupting the formation of a target transcriptional terminator hairpin placed upstream of a gene. While STARs are a promising addition to the repertoire of RNA regulators, much work remains to be done to optimize the fold activation of these systems. Here we apply rational RNA engineering strategies to improve the fold activation of two STAR regulators. We demonstrate that a combination of promoter strength tuning and multiple RNA stabilization strategies can improve fold activation from 5.4-fold to 13.4-fold for a STAR regulator derived from the pbuE riboswitch terminator. We then validate the generality of our approach and show that these same strategies improve fold activation from 2.1-fold to 14.6-fold for an unrelated STAR regulator. We also establish that the optimizations preserve the orthogonality of these STARs between themselves and a set of antisense RNA transcriptional repressors, enabling these optimized STARs to be used in more sophisticated circuits. These optimization strategies open the door for creating a generation of additional STARs to use in a broad array of biotechnologies."
10.1101/022798,"In a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli, bacteria in one of twelve populations evolved the ability to consume citrate, a previously unexploited resource in a glucose-limited medium. This innovation led to the frequency-dependent coexistence of citrate-consuming (Cit+) and non-consuming (Cit-) ecotypes, with Cit- bacteria persisting on the exogenously supplied glucose as well as other carbon molecules released by the Cit+ bacteria. After more than 10,000 generations of coexistence, however, the Cit- lineage went extinct; cells with the Cit- phenotype dropped to levels below detection, and the Cit- clade could not be detected by molecular assays based on its unique genotype. We hypothesized that this extinction event was a deterministic outcome of evolutionary change within the population, specifically the appearance of a more-fit Cit+ ecotype that competitively excluded the Cit- ecotype. We tested this hypothesis by re-evolving the population from one frozen sample taken just prior to the extinction and from another sample taken several thousand generations earlier, in each case for 500 generations and with 20-fold replication. To our surprise, the Cit- type did not go extinct in any of these replays, and Cit- cells also persisted in a single replicate that was propagated for 3,000 generations. Even more unexpectedly, we showed that the Cit- ecotype could reinvade the Cit+ population after its extinction. Taken together, these results indicate that the extinction of the Cit- ecotype was not a deterministic outcome driven by competitive exclusion by the Cit+ ecotype. The extinction also cannot be explained by demographic stochasticity, as the population size of the Cit- ecotype should have been many thousands of cells even during the daily transfer events. Instead, we infer that the extinction must have been caused by a rare chance event in which some aspect of the experimental conditions was inadvertently perturbed."
10.1101/022889,"BackgroundAnthropological and genetic data agree in indicating the African continent as the main place of origin for modern human. However, it is unclear whether early modern humans left Africa through a single, major process, dispersing simultaneously over Asia and Europe, or in two main waves, first through the Arab peninsula into Southern Asia and Oceania, and later through a Northern route crossing the Levant.\n\nResultsHere we show that accurate genomic estimates of the divergence times between European and African populations are more recent than those between Australo-Melanesia and Africa, and incompatible with the effects of a single dispersal. This difference cannot possibly be accounted for by the effects of hybridization with archaic human forms in Australo-Melanesia. Furthermore, in several populations of Asia we found evidence for relatively recent genetic admixture events, which could have obscured the signatures of the earliest processes.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that the hypothesis of a single major human dispersal from Africa appears hardly compatible with the observed historical and geographical patterns of genome diversity, and that Australo-Melanesian populations seem still to retain a genomic signature of a more ancient divergence from Africa"
10.1101/022863,"The classic finding in both flowering plants and mammals that hybrid lethality often depends on parent of origin effects suggests that divergence in the underlying loci might be an important source of hybrid incompatibilities between species. In flowering plants, there is now good evidence from diverse taxa that seed lethality arising from interploidy crosses is often caused by endosperm defects associated with deregulated imprinted genes. A similar seed lethality phenotype occurs in many crosses between closely related diploid species, but the genetic basis of this form of early-acting F1 postzygotic reproductive isolation is largely unknown. Here, we show that F1 hybrid seed lethality is an exceptionally strong isolating barrier between two closely related Mimulus species, M. guttatus and M. tilingii, with reciprocal crosses producing less than 1% viable seeds. Using a powerful crossing design and high-resolution genetic mapping, we identify both maternally- and paternally-derived loci that contribute to hybrid seed incompatibility. Strikingly, these two sets of loci are largely non-overlapping, providing strong evidence that genes with parent of origin effects are the primary driver of F1 hybrid seed lethality between M. guttatus and M. tilingii. We find a highly polygenic basis for both parental components of hybrid seed lethality suggesting that multiple incompatibility loci have accumulated to cause strong postzygotic isolation between these closely related species. Our genetic mapping experiment also reveals hybrid transmission ratio distortion and chromosomal differentiation, two additional correlates of functional and genomic divergence between species."
10.1101/022855,"BackgroundSpecies tree estimation is challenging in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which can make gene trees different from the species tree. Because ILS is expected to occur and the standard concatenation approach can return incorrect trees with high support in the presence of ILS, \""coalescent-based\"" summary methods (which first estimate gene trees and then combine gene trees into a species tree) have been developed that have theoretical guarantees of robustness to arbitrarily high amounts of ILS. Some studies have suggested that summary methods should only be used on \""c-genes\"" (i.e., recombination-free loci) that can be extremely short (sometimes fewer than 100 sites). However, gene trees estimated on short alignments can have high estimation error, and summary methods tend to have high error on short c-genes. To address this problem, Chifman and Kubatko introduced SVDquartets, a new coalescent-based method. SVDquartets takes multi-locus unlinked single-site data, infers the quartet trees for all subsets of four species, and then combines the set of quartet trees into a species tree using a quartet amalgamation heuristic. Yet, the relative accuracy of SVDquartets to leading coalescent-based methods has not been assessed.\n\nResultsWe compared SVDquartets to two leading coalescent-based methods (ASTRAL-2 and NJst), and to concatenation using maximum likelihood. We used a collection of simulated datasets, varying ILS levels, numbers of taxa, and number of sites per locus. Although SVDquartets was sometimes more accurate than ASTRAL-2 and NJst, most often the best results were obtained using ASTRAL-2, even on the shortest gene sequence alignments we explored (with only 10 sites per locus). Finally, concatenation was the most accurate of all methods under low ILS conditions.\n\nConclusionsASTRAL-2 generally had the best accuracy under higher ILS conditions, and concatenation had the best accuracy under the lowest ILS conditions. However, SVDquartets was competitive with the best methods under conditions with low ILS and small numbers of sites per locus. The good performance under many conditions of ASTRAL-2 in comparison to SVDquartets is surprising given the known vulnerability of ASTRAL-2 and similar methods to short gene sequences."
10.1101/022350,"Biological production of terminal alkenes has garnered a significant interest due to their industrial applications such as lubricants, detergents and fuels. Here, we engineered the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce terminal alkenes via a one-step fatty acid decarboxylation pathway and improved the alkene production using combinatorial engineering strategies. In brief, we first characterized eight fatty acid decarboxylases to enable and enhance alkene production. We then increased the production titer 7-fold by improving the availability of the precursor fatty acids. We additionally increased the titer about 5-fold through genetic cofactor engineering and gene expression tuning in rich medium. Lastly, we further improved the titer 1.8-fold to 3.7 mg/L by optimizing the culturing conditions in bioreactors. This study represents the first report of terminal alkene biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae, and the abovementioned combinatorial engineering approaches collectively increased the titer 67.4-fold. We envision that these approaches could provide insights into devising engineering strategies to improve the production of fatty acid-derived biochemicals in S. cerevisiae."
10.1101/022483,"Introductory ParagraphWe explored the microbial contributions to decomposition using a sophisticated approach to DNA Stable Isotope Probing (SIP). Our experiment evaluated the dynamics and ecological characteristics of functionally defined microbial groups that metabolize labile and structural C in soils. We added to soil a complex amendment representing plant derived organic matter substituted with either 13C-xylose or 13C-cellulose to represent labile and structural C pools derived from abundant components of plant biomass. We found evidence for 13C-incorporation into DNA from 13C-xylose and 13C-cellulose in 49 and 63 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively. The types of microorganisms that assimilated 13C in the 13C-xylose treatment changed over time being predominantly Firmicutes at day 1 followed by Bacteroidetes at day 3 and then Actinobacteria at day 7. These 13C-labeling dynamics suggest labile C traveled through different trophic levels. In contrast, microorganisms generally metabolized cellulose-C after 14 days and did not change to the same extent in phylogenetic composition over time. Microorganisms that metabolized cellulose-C belonged to poorly characterized but cosmopolitan soil lineages including Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes. We show that microbial life history traits are likely to constrain the diversity of microorganisms that participate in the soil C-cycle."
10.1101/022871,"The great density and structural complexity of pulmonary vessels and airways impose limitations on the generation of accurate reference standards, which are critical in training and in the validation of image processing methods for features such as pulmonary vessel segmentation or artery-vein (AV) separations. The design of synthetic computed tomography (CT) images of the lung could overcome these difficulties by providing a database of pseudorealistic cases in a constrained and controlled scenario where each part of the image is differentiated unequivocally. This work demonstrates a complete framework to generate computational anthropomorphic CT phantoms of the human lung automatically. Starting from biological and image-based knowledge about the topology and relationships between structures, the system is able to generate synthetic pulmonary arteries, veins, and airways using iterative growth methods that can be merged into a final simulated lung with realistic features. Visual examination and quantitative measurements of intensity distributions, dispersion of structures and relationships between pulmonary air and blood flow systems show good correspondence between real and synthetic lungs."
10.1101/022939,"Reproductive traits in plants tend to evolve rapidly due to various causes that include plant-pollinator coevolution and pollen competition, but the genomic basis of reproductive trait evolution is still largely unknown. To characterise evolutionary patterns of genome wide gene expression in reproductive tissues and to compare them to developmental stages of the sporophyte, we analysed evolutionary conservation and genetic diversity of protein-coding genes using microarray-based transcriptome data from three plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, rice (Oryza sativa) and soybean (Glycine max). In all three species a significant shift in gene expression occurs during gametogenesis in which genes of younger evolutionary age and higher genetic diversity contribute significantly more to the transcriptome than in other stages. We refer to this phenomenon as \""evolutionary bulge\"" during plant reproductive development because it differentiates the gametophyte from the sporophyte. The extent of the bulge pattern is much stronger than the transcriptomic hourglass, which postulates that during early embryo development an increased proportion of ancient and conserved genes contribute to the total transcriptome. In the three plant species, we observed an hourglass pattern only in A. thaliana but not in rice or soybean, which suggests that unlike the evolutionary bulge of reproductive genes the transcriptomic hourglass is not a general pattern of plant embryogenesis, which is consistent with the absence of a morphologically defined phylotypic stage in plant development."
10.1101/022947,"Purging through inbreeding occurs when consanguineous marriages increases the rate at which deleterious alleles are present in a homozygous state. In this study we carried out low-read depth (4-10x) whole-genome sequencing in 568 individuals from three Italian founder populations, and compared it to data from other Italian and European populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. We show extended consanguinity and depletion of homozygous genotypes at potentially detrimental sites in the founder populations compared to outbred populations. However these patterns are not compatible with the hypothesis of consanguinity driving the purging of highly deleterious mutations according to simulations. Therefore we conclude that genetic drift and the founder effect should be responsible for the observed purging of deleterious variants."
10.1101/022905,"The temporal change of phenotypes during the adaptive process remain largely unexplored, as do the genetic changes that affect these phenotypic changes. Here we focused on three mutations that rose to high frequency in the early stages of adaptation within 12 Escherichia coli populations subjected to thermal stress (42{degrees}C). All of the mutations were in the rpoB gene, which encodes the RNA polymerase beta subunit. For each mutation, we measured the growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) of clones at 42{degrees}C. We also compared growth and gene expression to their ancestor under unstressed (37{degrees}C) and stressed conditions (42{degrees}C). Each of the three mutations changed the expression of hundreds of genes and conferred large fitness advantages, apparently through the restoration of global gene expression from the stressed towards the pre-stressed state. Finally, we compared the phenotypic characteristics of one mutant, I572L, to two high-temperature adapted clones that have this mutation plus additional background mutations. The background mutations increased fitness, but they did not substantially change gene expression. We conclude that early mutations in a global transcriptional regulator cause extensive changes in gene expression, many of which are likely under positive selection for their effect in restoring the pre-stress physiology."
10.1101/022897,"Next-generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized the study of biology. However, the short read lengths of the dominant instruments complicate assembly of complex genomes and haplotype phasing of mixtures of similar sequences. Here we demonstrate a method to reconstruct the sequences of individual nucleic acid molecules up to 11.6 kilobases in length from short (150-bp) reads. We show that our method can construct 99.97%-accurate synthetic reads from bacterial, plant, and animal genomic samples, full-length mRNA sequences from human cancer cell lines, and individual HIV env gene variants from a mixture. The preparation of multiple samples can be multiplexed into a single tube, further reducing effort and cost relative to competing approaches. Our approach generates sequencing libraries in three days from less than one microgram of DNA in a single-tube format without custom equipment or specialized expertise."

The primary focus was on identification of human-specific elements of the interphase chromatin architecture of TADs responsible for transcriptional regulatory control of the NANOG, POU5F1, and POU3F2 genes. Comparative analyses of the four adjacent TADs spanning ~3.3 Mb NANOG locus-associated genomic region were carried-out to highlight primate-specific genomic features. Lastly, the putative mechanisms of the genome-wide regulatory effects of human-specific NANOG-binding sites (HSNBS) on expression of genes implicated in the fetal and adult brain development have been examined. Acquisition of primate-specific regulatory loci appears to rewire TADs exerting transcriptional control on pluripotency regulators, revealing a genomic placement pattern consistent with the enhanced regulatory impact of NANOG in primates. Proximity placement analysis of HSNBS identified a large expression signature in the human fetal neocortex temporal lobe comprising 4,957 genes, which appear to retain acquired in the embryo expression changes for many years of human brain development and maintain highly concordant expression profiles in the neocortex and prefrontal cortex regions of adult human brain. Collectively, reported herein observations indicate that genomic elements of pluripotency regulatory circuitry associated with HSNBS, specifically proteins of the classical NurD chromatin remodeling complex, contribute to transcriptional regulation of a large set of genes implicated in development and function of human brain.\n\nList of abbreviations5hmC, 5-Hydromethylcytosine\n\nCTCF, CCCTC-binding factor\n\nDHS, DNase hypersensitivity sites\n\nFHSRR, fixed human-specific regulatory regions\n\nGRNs, genomic regulatory networks\n\nHAR, human accelerated regions\n\nhCONDEL, human-specific conserved deletions\n\nhESC, human embryonic stem cells\n\nHSGRL, human-specific genomic regulatory loci\n\nHSNBS, human-specific NANOG-binding sites\n\nHSTFBS, human-specific transcription factor-binding sites\n\nLAD, lamina-associated domain\n\nLINE, long interspersed nuclear element\n\nlncRNA, long non-coding RNA\n\nLTR, long terminal repeat\n\nMADE, methylation-associated DNA editing\n\nmC, methylcytosine\n\nmESC, mouse embryonic stem cells\n\nNANOG, Nanog homeobox\n\nnt, nucleotide\n\nPOU5F1, POU class 5 homeobox 1\n\nPSDS, partial strand displacement state\n\nTAD, topologically associating domains\n\nTE, transposable elements\n\nTF, transcription factor\n\nTSC, triple-stranded complex\n\nTSS, transcription start sites\n\nSE, super-enhancers\n\nSED, super-enhancer domains\n\nsncRNA, small non coding RNA"
10.1101/022962,"The Axon Initial Segment [AIS], located within the first 30 m of the axon, has two essential roles in generating action potentials and maintaining axonal identity. AIS assembly depends on a {beta}IV-spectrin / ankyrin G scaffold, but its macromolecular arrangement is not well understood. Here we quantitatively determined the AIS nanoscale architecture using STo-chastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy [STORM]. First we directly demonstrate that the 190-nm periodicity of the AIS submembrane lattice results from longitudinal, head-to-head {beta}IV-spectrin molecules connecting actin rings. Using multicolor 3D-STORM, we resolve the nanoscale organization of ankyrin G: its aminoterminus associates with the submembrane lattice, whereas the carboxyterminus radially extends (~32 nm on average) toward the cytosol. This AIS nano-architecture is highly resistant to cytoskeletal perturbations, advocating its role in structural stabilization. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the AIS molecular architecture, and will help understanding the crucial physiological functions of this compartment."
10.1101/023010,"Alternative splicing is regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins and influences the expression of most eukaryotic genes. However, the role of this process in human disease, and particularly in cancer, is only starting to be unveiled. We systematically analyzed mutation, copy number and gene expression patterns of 1348 RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes in 11 solid tumor types, together with alternative splicing changes in these tumors and the enrichment of binding motifs in the alternatively spliced sequences. Our comprehensive study reveals widespread alterations in the expression of RBP genes, as well as novel mutations and copy number variations in association with multiple alternative splicing changes in cancer drivers and oncogenic pathways. Remarkably, the altered splicing patterns in several tumor types recapitulate those of undifferentiated cells. These patterns are predicted to be mainly controlled by MBNL1 and involve multiple cancer drivers, including the mitotic gene NUMA1. We show that NUMA1 alternative splicing induces enhanced cell proliferation and centrosome amplification in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Our study uncovers novel splicing networks that potentially contribute to cancer development and progression."
10.1101/023119,"Tandem fluorescent protein timers (tFTs) report on protein age through time-dependent change in color, which can be exploited to study protein turnover and trafficking. Each tFT, composed of two fluorescent proteins (FPs) that differ in maturation kinetics, is suited to follow protein dynamics within a specific time range determined by the maturation rates of both FPs. So far tFTs were constructed by combining different slower-maturing red fluorescent proteins (redFPs) with the same faster-maturing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Towards a comprehensive characterization of tFTs, we compare here tFTs composed of different faster-maturing greenFPs, while keeping the slower-maturing redFP constant (mCherry). Our results indicate that the greenFP maturation kinetics influences the time range of a tFT. Moreover, we observe that commonly used greenFPs can partially withstand proteasomal degradation due to the stability of the FP fold, which results in accumulation of tFT fragments in the cell. Depending on the order of FPs in the timer, incomplete proteasomal degradation either shifts the time range of the tFT towards slower time scales or precludes its use for measurements of protein turnover. We identify greenFPs that are efficiently degraded by the proteasome and provide simple guidelines for design of new tFTs.\n\nAbbreviationstFT - tandem fluorescent protein timer\n\nFP - fluorescent protein\n\ngreenFP - green fluorescent protein\n\nredFP - red fluorescent protein"
10.1101/023044,"Most organisms live in ever-challenging temporally fluctuating environments. Theory suggests that the evolution of anticipatory (or deterministic) maternal effects underlies adaptation to environments that regularly fluctuate every other generation because of selection for increased offspring performance. Evolution of maternal bet-hedging reproductive strategies that randomize offspring phenotypes is in turn expected to underlie adaptation to irregularly fluctuating environments. Although maternal effects are ubiquitous their adaptive significance is unknown since they can easily evolve as a correlated response to selection for increased maternal performance. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we show the experimental evolution of maternal provisioning of offspring with glycogen, in populations facing a novel anoxia hatching environment every other generation. As expected with the evolution of deterministic maternal effects, improved embryo hatching survival under anoxia evolved at the expense of fecundity and glycogen provisioning when mothers experienced anoxia early in life. Unexpectedly, populations facing an irregularly fluctuating anoxia hatching environment failed to evolve maternal bet-hedging reproductive strategies. Instead, adaptation in these populations should have occurred through the evolution of balancing trade-offs over multiple generations, since they evolved reduced fitness over successive generations in anoxia but did not go extinct during experimental evolution. Mathematical modelling confirms our conclusion that adaptation to a wide range of patterns of environmental fluctuations hinges on the existence of deterministic maternal effects, and that they are generally much more likely to contribute to adaptation than maternal bet-hedging reproductive strategies."
10.1101/022996,"Uniparental reproduction in diploids, via asexual reproduction or selfing, reduces the independence with which separate loci are transmitted across generations. This is expected to increase the extent to which a neutral marker is affected by selection elsewhere in the genome. Such effects have previously been quantified in coalescent models involving selfing. Here we examine the effects of background selection and balancing selection in diploids capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction (i.e., partial asexuality). We find that the effect of background selection on reducing coalescent time (and effective population size) can be orders of magnitude greater when rates of sex are low than when sex is common. This is because asexuality enhances the effects of background selection through both a recombination effect and a segregation effect. We show that there are several reasons that the strength of background selection differs between systems with partial asexuality and those with comparable levels of uniparental reproduction via selfing. Expectations for reductions in Ne via background selection have been verified using stochastic simulations. In contrast to background selection, balancing selection increases the coalescent time for a linked neutral site. With partial asexuality, the effect of balancing selection is somewhat dependent upon the mode of selection (e.g., heterozygote advantage vs. negative frequency dependent selection) in a manner that does not apply to selfing. This is because the frequency of heterozygotes, which are required for recombination onto alternative genetic backgrounds, is more dependent on the pattern of selection with partial asexuality than with selfing."
10.1101/022988,"A key quantity in the analysis of structured populations is the parameter K, which describes the number of subpopulations that make up the total population. Inference of K ideally proceeds via the model evidence, which is equivalent to the likelihood of the model. However, the evidence in favour of a particular value of K cannot usually be computed exactly, and instead programs such as SO_SCPLOWTRUCTUREC_SCPLOW make use of simple heuristic estimators to approximate this quantity. We show - using simulated data sets small enough that the true evidence can be computed exactly - that these simple heuristics often fail to estimate the true evidence, and that this can lead to incorrect conclusions about K. Our proposed solution is to use thermodynamic integration (TI) to estimate the model evidence. After outlining the TI methodology we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a range of simulated data sets. We find that TI can be used to obtain estimates of the model evidence that are orders of magnitude more accurate and precise than those based on simple heuristics. Furthermore, estimates of K based on these values are found to be more reliable than those based on a suite of model comparison statistics. Our solution is implemented for models both with and without admixture in the software TO_SCPLOWRUEC_SCPLOWK."
10.1101/023093,"Testing for conserved and novel mechanisms underlying phenotypic evolution requires a diversity of genomes available for comparison spanning multiple independent lineages. For example, complex social behavior in insects has been investigated primarily with eusocial lineages, nearly all of which are Hymenoptera. If conserved genomic influences on sociality do exist, we need data from a wider range of taxa that also vary in their levels of sociality. Here we present information on the genome of the subsocial beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, a species long used to investigate evolutionary questions of complex social behavior. We used this genome to address two questions. First, does life history predict overlap in gene models more strongly than phylogenetic groupings? Second, like other insects with highly developed social behavior but unlike other beetles, does N. vespilloides have DNA methylation? We found the overlap in gene models was similar between N. vespilloides and all other insect groups regardless of life history. Unlike previous studies of beetles, we found strong evidence of DNA methylation, which allows this species to be used to address questions about the potential role of methylation in social behavior. The addition of this genome adds a coleopteran resource to answer questions about the evolution and mechanistic basis of sociality."
10.1101/023036,"BackgroundIncomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modelled by the multi-species coalescent (MSC), is known to create discordance between gene trees and species trees, and lead to inaccurate species tree estimations unless appropriate methods are used to estimate the species tree. While many statistically consistent methods have been developed to estimate the species tree in the presence of ILS, only ASTRAL-2 and NJst have been shown to have good accuracy on large datasets. Yet, NJst is generally slower and less accurate than ASTRAL-2, and cannot run on some datasets.\n\nResultsWe have redesigned NJst to enable it to run on all datasets, and we have expanded its design space so that it can be used with different distance-based tree estimation methods. The resultant method, ASTRID, is statistically consistent under the MSC model, and has accuracy that is competitive with ASTRAL-2. Furthermore, ASTRID is much faster than ASTRAL-2, completing in minutes on some datasets for which ASTRAL-2 used hours.\n\nConclusionsASTRID is a new coalescent-based method for species tree estimation that is competitive with the best current method in terms of accuracy, while being much faster. ASTRID is available in open source form on github."
10.1101/023002,"The precise interpretation of environmental sulfur isotope records requires a quantitative understanding of the biochemical controls on sulfur isotope fractionation by the principle isotope-fractionating process within the S cycle, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR). Here we provide the only direct observation of the major (34S/32S) and minor (33S/32S, 36S/32S) sulfur isotope fractionations imparted by a central enzyme in the energy metabolism of sulfate reducers, dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB). Results from in vitro sulfite reduction experiments allow us to calculate the in vitro DsrAB isotope effect in 34S/32S (hereafter, 34{varepsilon}DsrAB) to be 15.3{+/-}2{per thousand}, 2{sigma}.The accompanying minor isotope effect in 33S, described as 33{lambda}DsrAB, is calculated to be 0.5150{+/-}0.0012, 2{sigma}. These observations facilitate a rigorous evaluation of the isotopic fractionation associated with the dissimilatory MSR pathway, as well as of the environmental variables that govern the overall magnitude of fractionation by natural communities of sulfate reducers. The isotope effect induced by DsrAB upon sulfite reduction is a factor of 0.3 to 0.6 times prior indirect estimates, which have ranged from 25 to 53{per thousand} in 34{varepsilon}DsrAB. The minor isotope fractionation observed from DsrAB is consistent with a kinetic or equilibrium effect. Our in vitro constraints on the magnitude of 34{varepsilon}DsrAB is similar to the median value of experimental observations compiled from all known published work, where 34{varepsilon}r-p = 16.1{per thousand} (r - p indicates reactant versus product, n = 648). This value closely matches those of MSR operating at high sulfate reduction rates in both laboratory chemostat experiments (34{varepsilon}SO4-H2S = 17.3{+/-}1.5{per thousand}) and in modern marine sediments (34{varepsilon}SO4-H2S = 17.3{+/-}3.8{per thousand}). Targeting the direct isotopic consequences of a specific enzymatic processes is a fundamental step toward a biochemical foundation for reinterpreting the biogeochemical and geobiological sulfur isotope records in modern and ancient environments."
10.1101/023051,"Altitudinal gradients represent short-range clines of environmental parameters like temperature, radiation, seasonality and pathogen abundance, which allows to study the foot-prints of natural selection in geographically close populations. We investigated phenotypic variation for frost resistance and light response in five Arabidopsis thaliana populations ranging from 580 to 2,350 meters altitude at two different valleys in the North Italian Alps. All populations were resequenced as pools and we used a Bayesian method to detect correlations between allele frequencies and altitude while accounting for sampling, pooled sequencing and the expected amount of shared drift among populations. The among population variation to frost resistance was not correlated with altitude. An anthocyanin deficiency causing a high leaf mortality was present in the highest population, which may be non-adaptive and potentially deleterious phenotypic variation. The genomic analysis revealed that the two high-altitude populations are more closely related than the geographically close low-altitude populations. A correlation of genetic variation with altitude revealed an enrichment of highly differentiated SNPs located in genes that are associated with biological processes like response to stress and light. We further identified regions with long blocks of presence absence variation suggesting a sweep-like pattern across populations. Our analysis indicate a complex interplay of local adaptation and a demographic history that was influenced by glaciation cycles and/or rapid seed dispersal by animals or other forces."
10.1101/023085,"We exploit the methodological similarity between ancestral genome reconstruction and extant genome scaffolding. We present a method, called ARO_SCPCAPTC_SCPCAP-DO_SCPCAPEC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPOC_SCPCAP that constructs neighborhood relationships between genes or contigs, in both ancestral and extant genomes, in a phylogenetic context. It is able to handle dozens of complete genomes, including genes with complex histories, by using gene phylogenies reconciled with a species tree, that is, annotated with speciation, duplication and loss events. Reconstructed ancestral or extant synteny comes with a support computed from an exhaustive exploration of the solution space. We compare our method with a previously published one that follows the same goal on a small number of genomes with universal unicopy genes. Then we test it on the whole Ensembl database, by proposing partial ancestral genome structures, as well as a more complete scaffolding for many partially assembled genomes on 69 eukaryote species. We carefully analyze a couple of extant adjacencies proposed by our method, and show that they are indeed real links in the extant genomes, that were missing in the current assembly. On a reduced data set of 39 eutherian mammals, we estimate the precision and sensitivity of ARO_SCPCAPTC_SCPCAP-DO_SCPCAPEC_SCPCAPCO_SCPCAPOC_SCPCAP by simulating a fragmentation in some well assembled genomes, and measure how many adjacencies are recovered. We find a very high precision, while the sensitivity depends on the quality of the data and on the proximity of closely related genomes."
10.1101/023176,"The nonrandom distribution of meiotic recombination shapes heredity and genetic diversification. A widely held view is that individual hotspots -- favored sites of recombination initiation -- are always ephemeral because they evolve rapidly toward extinction. An alternative view, often ignored or dismissed as implausible, predicts conservation of the positions of hotspots if they are chromosomal features under selective constraint, such as gene promoters. Here we empirically test opposite predictions of these theories by comparing genome-wide maps of meiotic recombination initiation from widely divergent species in the Saccharomyces clade. We find that the frequent overlap of hotspots with promoters is true of the species tested and, consequently, hotspot positions are well conserved. Remarkably, however, the relative strength of individual hotspots is also highly conserved, as are larger-scale features of the distribution of recombination initiation. This stability, not predicted by prior models, suggests that the particular shape of the yeast recombination landscape is adaptive, and helps in understanding evolutionary dynamics of recombination in other species."
10.1101/022970,"Analyses of living and fossil taxa are crucial for understanding changes in biodiversity through time. The Total Evidence method allows living and fossil taxa to be combined in phylogenies, by using molecular data for living taxa and morphological data for both living and fossil taxa. With this method, substantial overlap of morphological data among living and fossil taxa is crucial for accurately inferring topology. However, although molecular data for living species is widely available, scientists using and generating morphological data mainly focus on fossils. Therefore, there is a gap in our knowledge of neontological morphological data even in well-studied groups such as mammals.\n\nWe investigated the amount of morphological (cladistic) data available for living mammals and how this data was phylogenetically distributed across orders. 22 of 28 mammalian orders have <25% species with available morphological data; this has implications for the accurate placement of fossil taxa, although the issue is less pronounced at higher taxonomic levels. In most orders, species with available data are randomly distributed across the phylogeny, which may reduce the impact of the problem. We suggest that increased morphological data collection efforts for living taxa are needed to produce accurate Total Evidence phylogenies."
10.1101/023077,"The complex eukaryotic cell is a result of an ancient endosymbiosis and one of the major evolutionary transitions. The timing of key eukaryotic innovations relative to the acquisition of mitochondria remains subject to considerable debate, yet the evolutionary process itself might constrain the order of these events. Endosymbiosis entailed levels-of-selection conflicts, and mechanisms of conflict mediation had to evolve for eukaryogenesis to proceed. The initial mechanisms of conflict mediation were based on the pathways inherited from prokaryotic symbionts and led to metabolic homeostasis in the eukaryotic cell, while later mechanisms (e.g., mitochondrial gene transfer) contributed to the expansion of the eukaryotic genome. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for conflict arose with the emergence of sex involving whole-cell fusion. While early evolution of cell fusion may have affected symbiont acquisition, sex together with the competitive symbiont behaviour would have destabilized the emerging higher-level unit. Cytoplasmic mixing, on the other hand, would have been beneficial for selfish endosymbionts, capable of using their own metabolism to manipulate the life history of the host. Given the results of our mathematical modelling, we argue that sex represents a rather late proto-eukaryotic innovation, allowing for the growth of the chimeric nucleus and contributing to the successful completion of the evolutionary transition."
10.1101/023101,"Although the DNA-binding protein PRDM9 plays a critical role in the specification of meiotic recombination hotspots in mice and apes, it appears to be absent from many vertebrate species, including birds. To learn about the determinants of fine-scale recombination rates and their evolution in natural populations lacking PRDM9, we inferred fine-scale recombination maps from population resequencing data for two bird species, the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, and the long-tailed finch, Poephila acuticauda, whose divergence is on par with that between human and chimpanzee. We find that both bird species have hotspots, and these are enriched near CpG islands and transcription start sites. In sharp contrast to what is seen in mice and apes, the hotspots are largely shared between the two species, with indirect evidence of conservation extending across bird species tens of millions of years diverged. These observations link the evolution of hotspots to their genetic architecture, suggesting that in the absence of PRDM9 binding specificity, accessibility of the genome to the cellular recombination machinery, particularly around functional genomic elements, both enables increased recombination and constrains its evolution."
10.1101/022640,"Estimates of microbial fitness from growth curves are inaccurate. Rather, competition experiments are necessary for accurate estimation. But competition experiments require unique markers and are difficult to perform with isolates derived from a common ancestor or non-model organisms. Here we describe a new approach for predicting relative growth of microbes in a mixed culture utilizing mono- and mixed culture growth curve data. We validated this approach using growth curve and competition experiments with E. coli. Our approach provides an effective way to predict growth in a mixed culture and infer relative fitness. Furthermore, by integrating several growth phases, it provides an ecological interpretation for microbial fitness."
10.1101/023168,"BackgroundSpecies tree estimation is challenged by gene tree heterogeneity resulting from biological processes such as duplication and loss, hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and horizontal gene transfer (HGT).\n\nMathematical theory about reconstructing species trees in the presence of HGT alone or ILS alone suggests that quartet-based species tree methods (known to be statistically consistent under ILS, or under bounded amounts of HGT) might be effective techniques for estimating species trees when both HGT and ILS are present.\n\nResultsWe evaluated several publicly available coalescent-based methods and concatenation under maximum likelihood on simulated datasets with moderate ILS and varying levels of HGT. Our study shows that two quartet-based species tree estimation methods (ASTRAL-2 and weighted Quartets MaxCut) are both highly accurate, even on datasets with high rates of HGT. In contrast, although NJst and concatenation using maximum likelihood are highly accurate under low HGT, they are less robust to high HGT rates.\n\nConclusionOur study shows that quartet-based species-tree estimation methods can be highly accurate under the presence of both HGT and ILS. The study suggests the possibility that some quartet-based methods might be statistically consistent under phylogenomic models of gene tree heterogeneity with both HGT and ILS."
10.1101/023127,"Classification is an everyday instinct as well as a full-fledged scientific discipline. Throughout the history of medicine, disease classification is central to how we develop knowledge, make diagnosis, and assign treatment. Here we discuss the classification of cancer, the process of categorizing cancer subtypes based on their observed clinical and biological features. Traditionally, cancer nomenclature is primarily based on organ location, e.g., \""lung cancer\"" designates a tumor originating in lung structures. Within each organ-specific major type, finer subgroups can be defined based on patient age, cell type, histological grades, and sometimes molecular markers, e.g., hormonal receptor status in breast cancer, or microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer. In the past 15+ years, high-throughput technologies have generated rich new data regarding somatic variations in DNA, RNA, protein, or epigenomic features for many cancers. These data, collected for increasingly large tumor collections, have provided not only new insights into the biological diversity of human cancers, but also exciting opportunities to discover previously unrecognized cancer subtypes. Meanwhile, the unprecedented volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for biostatisticians, cancer biologists, and clinicians alike. Here we review five related issues that represent contemporary problems in cancer taxonomy and interpretation. 1. How many cancer subtypes are there? 2. How can we evaluate the robustness of a new classification system? 3. How are classification systems affected by intratumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution? 4. How should we interpret cancer subtypes? 5. Can multiple classification systems coexist? While related issues have existed for a long time, we will focus on those aspects that have been magnified by the recent influx of complex multi-omics data. Ongoing exploration of these problems is essential for data-driven refinement of cancer classification and the successful application of these concepts in precision medicine."
10.1101/023184,"Embryogenesis is an extraordinarily robust process, exhibiting the ability to control tissue size and repair patterning defects in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations. The size and shape of a developing tissue is a function of the number and size of its constituent cells as well as their geometric packing. How these cellular properties are coordinated at the tissue level to ensure developmental robustness remains a mystery; understanding this process requires studying multiple concurrent processes that make up morphogenesis, including the spatial patterning of cell fates and apoptosis, as well as cell intercalations. In this work, we develop a computational model that aims to understand aspects of the robust pattern repair mechanisms of the Drosophila embryonic epidermal tissues. Size control in this system has previously been shown to rely on the regulation of apoptosis rather than proliferation; however, to date little work has been done to understand the role of cellular mechanics in this process. We employ a vertex model of an embryonic segment to test hypotheses about the emergence of this size control. Comparing the model to previously published data across wild type and genetic perturbations, we show that passive mechanical forces suffice to explain the observed size control in the posterior (P) compartment of a segment. However, observed asymmetries in cell death frequencies across the segment are demonstrated to require patterning of cellular properties in the model. Finally, we show that distinct forms of mechanical regulation in the model may be distinguished by differences in cell shapes in the P compartment, as quantified through experimentally accessible summary statistics, as well as by the tissue recoil after laser ablation experiments.\n\nAuthor SummaryDeveloping embryos are able to grow organs of the correct size even in the face of significant external perturbations. Such robust size control is achieved via tissue-level coordination of cell growth, proliferation, death and rearrangement, through mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we employ computational modelling to test hypotheses of size control in the developing fruit fly. Segments in the surface tissues of the fruit fly embryo have been shown to achieve the same size even if the number of cells in each segment is perturbed genetically. We show that simple mechanical interactions between the cells of this tissue can recapitulate previously gathered data on tissue sizes and cell numbers. However, this simple model does not capture the experimentally observed spatial variation in cell death rates in this tissue, which may be explained through several adaptations to the model. These distinct adaptations may be distinguished through summary statistics of the tissue behaviour, such as statistics of cell shapes or tissue recoil after cutting. This work demonstrates how computational modelling can help investigate the complex mechanical interactions underlying tissue size and shape, which are important for understanding the underlying causes of birth defects and diseases driven by uncontrolled growth."
10.1101/023135,"Herbaria archive a record of changes of worldwide plant biodiversity harboring millions of specimens that contain DNA suitable for genome sequencing. To profit from this resource, it is fundamental to understand in detail the process of DNA degradation in herbarium specimens. We investigated patterns of DNA fragmentation -length and base composition at breaking points-, and nucleotide misincorporation by analyzing 86 herbarium samples spanning the last 300 years using Illumina shot-gun sequencing. We found an exponential decay relationship between DNA fragmentation and time, and estimated a per nucleotide fragmentation rate of 1.66 x 10-4 per year, which is ten times faster than the rate estimated for fossilized bones. Additionally, we found that strand breaks occur specially before purines, and that depurination-driven DNA breakage occurs constantly through time and can to a great extent explain decreasing fragment length over time. Similar of what has been found analyzing ancient DNA from bones, we found a strong correlation between the deamination-driven accumulation of cytosine (C) to thymine (T) substitutions and time, which reinforces the importance of substitution patterns to authenticate the ancient/historical nature of DNA fragments. Accurate estimations of DNA degradation through time will allow informed decisions about laboratory and computational procedures to take advantage of the vast collection of worldwide herbarium specimens."
10.1101/023200,"Hearing, vision, touch -- underlying all of these senses is stimulus selectivity, a robust information processing operation in which cortical neurons respond more to some stimuli than to others. Previous models assume that these neurons receive the highest weighted input from an ensemble encoding the preferred stimulus, but dendrites enable other possibilities. Non-linear dendritic processing can produce stimulus selectivity based on the spatial distribution of synapses, even if the total preferred stimulus weight does not exceed that of non-preferred stimuli. Using a multi-subunit non-linear model, we demonstrate that selectivity can arise from the spatial distribution of synapses. Moreover, we show that this implementation of stimulus selectivity increases the neuron's robustness to synaptic and dendritic failure. Contrary to an equivalent linear model, our model can maintain stimulus selectivity even when 50% of synapses fail or when more than 50% of dendrites fail. We then use a Layer 2/3 biophysical neuron model to show that our implementation is consistent with recent experimental observations, of a mixture of selectivities in dendrites, that can differ from the somatic selectivity, and of hyperpolarization broadening somatic tuning without affecting dendritic tuning. Our model predicts that an initially non-selective neuron can become selective when depolarized. In addition to motivating new experiments, the model's increased robustness to synapses and dendrites loss provides a starting point for fault-resistant neuromorphic chip development."
10.1101/023259,"Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of individual trees are a prerequisite for an accurate assessment of tree competition, growth, and morphological plasticity. Until recently, our ability to measure the dimensionality, spatial arrangement, shape of trees, and shape of tree components with precision has been constrained by technological and logistical limitations and cost. Traditional methods of forest biometrics provide only partial measurements and are labor intensive. Active remote technologies such as LiDAR operated from airborne platforms provide only partial crown reconstructions. The use of terrestrial LiDAR is laborious, has portability limitations and high cost. In this work we capitalized on recent improvements in the capabilities and availability of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), light and inexpensive cameras, and developed an affordable method for obtaining precise and comprehensive 3D models of trees and small groups of trees. The method employs slow-moving UAVs that acquire images along predefined trajectories near and around targeted trees, and computer vision-based approaches that process the images to obtain detailed tree reconstructions. After we confirmed the potential of the methodology via simulation we evaluated several UAV platforms, strategies for image acquisition, and image processing algorithms. We present an original, step-by-step workflow which utilizes open source programs and original software. We anticipate that future development and applications of our method will improve our understanding of forest self-organization emerging from the competition among trees, and will lead to a refined generation of individual-tree-based forest models."

We document that we can reproduce very well the shape and volume of patient specific thrombus segmented in giant aneurysms.

10.1101/023275,"The relationships between the core-periphery architecture of the species interaction network and the mechanisms ensuring the stability in mutualistic ecological communities are still unclear. In particular, most studies have focused their attention on asymptotic resilience or persistence, neglecting how perturbations propagate through the system. Here we develop a theoretical framework to evaluate the relationship between architecture of the interaction networks and the impact of perturbations by studying localization, a measure describing the ability of the perturbation to propagate through the network. We show that mutualistic ecological communities are localized, and localization reduces perturbation propagation and attenuates its impact on species abundance. Localization depends on the topology of the interaction networks, and it positively correlates with the variance of the weighted degree distribution, a signature of the network topological hetereogenity. Our results provide a different perspective on the interplay between the architecture of interaction networks in mutualistic communities and their stability."
10.1101/023069,"A number of universals can be observed in the developing embryos of all phyla. An attempt is made here to describe some of these with a simple model, one consisting of two mutually repelling regions of gene patterning produced by signaling pathways, two acting at each growth phase. The diffusion of ligands is short range, nearest or near neighbors, but the transcription patterns extend over many cellular diameters. The universals discussed are: gastrulation, formation of a blastopore, patterning of stem cells as surrounding compartments (propagating anew with each growth phase, to the adult), the origin of bilaterality, the prevalence of segmentation, and the general ability to regenerate and duplicate. The origin of organ sizes are determined by the parameters of the signaling pathways involved, independent of cell sizes or numbers. The important fiber mesh, or fiber network that can also extend over many cell diameters is also briefly discussed, and is seen as a partner with the signaling pathways in the overall patterning."
10.1101/023234,"Natural selection reduces neutral population genetic diversity near coding regions of the genome because recombination has not had time to unlink selected alleles from nearby neutral regions. For ten sub-species of great apes, including human, we show that long-term selection affects estimates of divergence on the X differently from the autosomes. Divergence increases with increasing distance from genes on both the X chromosome and autosomes, but increases faster on the X chromosome than autosomes, resulting in increasing ratios of X/A divergence in putatively neutral regions. Similarly, divergence is reduced more on the X chromosome in neutral regions near conserved regulatory elements than on the autosomes. Consequently estimates of male mutation bias, which rely on comparing neutral divergence between the X and autosomes, are twice as high in neutral regions near genes versus far from genes. Our results suggest filters for putatively neutral genomic regions differ between the X and autosomes."
10.1101/023333,"The structure of environmentally induced phenotypic covariation can influence the effective strength and magnitude of natural selection. Yet our understanding of the factors that contribute to and influence the evolutionary lability of such covariation is poor. Most studies have either examined environmental variation without accounting for covariation, or examined phenotypic and genetic covariation without distinguishing the environmental component. In this study we examined the effect of mutational perturbations on different properties of environmental covariation, as well as mean shape. We use strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing well-characterized mutations known to influence wing shape, as well as naturally-derived strains, all reared under carefully-controlled conditions and with the same genetic background. We find that mean shape changes more freely than the covariance structure, and that different properties of the covariance matrix change independently from each other. The perturbations affect matrix orientation more than they affect matrix eccentricity or total variance. Yet, mutational effects on matrix orientation do not cluster according to the developmental pathway that they target. These results suggest that it might be useful to consider a more general concept of  decanalization, involving all aspects of variation and covariation."
10.1101/023242,"In this paper I address the question -- how large is a phylogenetic sample? I propose a definition of a phylogenetic effective sample size for Brownian motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes -- the regression effective sample size. I discuss how mutual information can be used to define an effective sample size in the non-normal process case and compare these two definitions to an already present concept of effective sample size (the mean effective sample size). Through a simulation study I find that the AICc is robust if one corrects for the number of species or effective number of species. Lastly I discuss how the concept of the phylogenetic effective sample size can be useful for biodiversity quantification, identification of interesting clades and deciding on the importance of phylogenetic correlations."
10.1101/023341,"The study of human evolution has been revolutionized by inferences from ancient DNA analyses. Key to these is the reliable estimation of the age of ancient specimens. The current best practice is radiocarbon dating, which relies on characterizing the decay of radioactive carbon isotope (14C), and is applicable for dating up to 50,000-year-old samples. Here, we introduce a new genetic method that uses recombination clock for dating. The key idea is that an ancient genome has evolved less than the genomes of extant individuals. Thus, given a molecular clock provided by the steady accumulation of recombination events, one can infer the age of the ancient genome based on the number of missing years of evolution. To implement this idea, we take advantage of the shared history of Neanderthal gene flow into non-Africans that occurred around 50,000 years ago. Using the Neanderthal ancestry decay patterns, we estimate the Neanderthal admixture time for both ancient and extant samples. The difference in these admixture dates then provides an estimate of the age of the ancient genome. We show that our method provides reliable results in simulations. We apply our method to date five ancient Eurasian genomes with radiocarbon dates ranging between 12,000 to 45,000 years and recover consistent age estimates. Our method provides a complementary approach for dating ancient human samples and is applicable to ancient non-African genomes with Neanderthal ancestry. Extensions of this methodology that use older shared events may be able to date ancient genomes that fall beyond the radiocarbon frontier.\n\nSignificanceWe introduce a new genetic method for dating ancient human samples that uses the recombination clock. The main idea relies on the insight that an ancient genome lacks several thousand years of evolution compared to genomes of living individuals. To infer the age of ancient genomes, we take advantage of the shared history of Neanderthal gene flow into non-Africans that occurred around 50,000 years ago. By characterizing the dates of Neanderthal gene flow in ancient and extant genomes and quantifying the difference in these dates, we estimate the age of the ancient specimen. Our method is applicable for dating ancient samples more recent than the Neanderthal mixture event, so on par with radiocarbon dating, providing a complementary approach for dating."

The user manual for SEX-DETector is available here: https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/Download-5251.html?lang=en.\n\nPaper submitted as a Genome Resource.\n\nWe propose a probabilistic framework to infer autosomal and sex-linked genes from RNA-seq data of a cross for any sex chromosome type (XY, ZW, UV). Sex chromosomes (especially the nonrecombining and repeat-dense Y, W, U and V) are notoriously difficult to sequence. Strategies have been developed to obtain partially assembled sex chromosome sequences. However, most of them remain difficult to apply to numerous non-model organisms, either because they require a reference genome, or because they are designed for evolutionarily old systems. Sequencing a cross (parents and progeny) by RNA-seq to study the segregation of alleles and infer sex-linked genes is a cost-efficient strategy, which also provides expression level estimates. However, the lack of a proper statistical framework has limited a broader application of this approach. Tests on empirical data show that our method identifies many more sex-linked genes than existing pipelines, while making reliable inferences for downstream analyses. Simulations suggest few individuals are needed for optimal results. For species with unknown sex-determination system, the method can assess the presence and type (XY versus ZW) of sex chromosomes through a model comparison strategy. The method is particularly well optimised for sex chomosomes of young or intermediate age, which are expected in thousands of yet unstudied lineages. Any organism, including non-model ones for which nothing is known a priori, that can be bred in the lab, is suitable for our method.

10.1101/023267,"ABSTRACT\n\nWildfires and mountain pine beetle (MPB) attacks are important contributors to the development of stand structure in lodgepole pine, and major drivers of its evolution. The historical pattern of these events have been correlated with variation in cone serotiny (possessing cones that remain closed and retain seeds until opened by fire) across the Rocky Mountain region of Western North America. As climate change brings about a marked increase in the size, intensity, and severity of our wildfires, it is becoming increasingly important to study the genetic basis of serotiny as an adaptation to wildfire. Knowledge gleaned from these studies would have direct implications for forest management in the future, and for the future. In this study, we collected physical data and DNA samples from 122 trees of two different areas in the IDF-dk of British Columbia; multi-cohort stands (Cariboo-Chilcotin) with a history of mixed-severity fire and frequent MPB disturbances, and single-cohort stands (Logan Lake) with a history of stand replacing (crown) fire and infrequent MPB disturbances. We used QuantiNemo to construct simulated populations of lodgepole pine at five different growth rates, and compared the statistical outputs to physical data, then ran a random forest analysis to shed light on sources of variation in serotiny. We also sequenced 39 SNPs, of which 23 failed or were monomorphic. The 16 informative SNPs were used to calculate HO and HE, which were included alongside genotypes for a second random forest analysis. Our best random forest model explained 33% of variation in serotiny, using simulation and physical variables. Our results highlight the need for more investigation into this matter, using more extensive approaches, and also consideration of alternative methods of heredity such as epigenetics."
10.1101/023317,"1.Hi-C is one of the main methods for investigating spatial co-localisation of DNA in the nucleus. However, the raw sequencing data obtained from Hi-C experiments suffer from large biases and spurious contacts, making it difficult to identify true interactions. Existing methods use complex models to account for biases and do not provide a significance threshold for detecting interactions. Here we introduce a simple binomial probabilistic model that resolves complex biases and distinguishes between true and false interactions. The model corrects biases of known and unknown origin and yields a p-value for each interaction, providing a reliable threshold based on significance. We demonstrate this experimentally by testing the method against a random ligation dataset. Our method outperforms previous methods and provides a statistical framework for further data analysis, such as comparisons of Hi-C interactions between different conditions. GOTHiC is available as a BioConductor package (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOTHiC.html)."
10.1101/023291,"Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a type of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) where the phase of a low-frequency rhythm modulates the amplitude of a higher frequency, is becoming an important indicator of information transmission in the brain. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its generation remain undetermined. A realistic, yet tractable computational model of the phenomenon is thus needed. Here we propose a neural mass model of a cortical column, comprising fourteen neuronal populations distributed across four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6). The conditional transfer entropies (cTE) from the phases to the amplitudes of the generated oscillations are estimated by means of the conditional mutual information. This approach provides information regarding directionality by distinguishing PAC from APC (amplitude-phase coupling), i.e. the information transfer from amplitudes to phases, and can be used to estimate other types of CFC such as amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC). While experiments often only focus on one or two PAC combinations (e.g., theta-gamma or alpha-gamma), we found that a cortical column can simultaneously generate almost all possible PAC combinations, depending on connectivity parameters, time constants, and external inputs. We found that the strength of PAC between two populations was strongly correlated with the strength of the effective connections between them and, on average, did not depend upon the presence or absence of a direct (anatomical) connection. When considering a cortical column circuit as a complex network, we found that neuronal populations making indirect PAC connections had, on average, higher local clustering coefficient, efficiency, and betweenness centrality than populations making direct connections and populations not involved in PAC connections. This suggests that their interactions were more efficient when transmitting information. Since more than 60% of the obtained interactions represented indirect connections, our results highlight the importance of the topology of cortical circuits for the generation on of the PAC phenomenon. Finally, our results demonstrated that indirect PAC interactions can be explained by a cascade of direct CFC and same-frequency band interactions, suggesting that PAC analysis of experimental data should be accompanied by the estimation of other types of frequency interactions for an integrative understanding of the phenomenon."
10.1101/023366,"The Cas9/CRISPR system is a powerful tool for studying gene function. Here we describe a method that allows temporal control of Cas9/CRISPER activity based on conditional Cas9 destabilization. We demonstrate that fusing an FKBP12-derived destabilizing domain to Cas9 (DD-CAS9) enables conditional Cas9 expression in vitro in the presence of an FKBP12 synthetic ligand and temporal control of gene-editing. Further, we show that this strategy can be easily adapted to co-express, from the same promoter, DD-Cas9 with any other gene of interest, without the latter being co-modulated. In particular, when co-expressed with inducible Cre-ERT2, our system enables parallel, independent manipulation of alleles targeted by Cas9 and traditional recombinase with single-cell specificity. We anticipate this platform will be used for the systematic identification of essential genes and the interrogation of genes functional interactions."

10.1101/022590,"Large magnetic nanoparticles (over 25 nm diameter) are a valuable commodity but remain difficult to synthesize using traditional chemical synthesis methods. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTBs) have evolved mechanisms to produce monodisperse, protected magnetic nanostructures within organelles (magnetosomes). Genomic diversity of MTB species result in unique particle properties that vary in shape and size ranging from 30 nm to 150 nm based on the genetic background. Culturing and engineering MTBs for the production of magnetic nanoparticles carries tremendous potential but is underdeveloped. This primarily because MTBs are difficult to culture and genetically manipulate, limitations that could be alleviated with adaptive evolution. We propose the magnetotrophic reactor, a novel bioreactor system for adaptively evolving MTBs for better growth and magnetosome production. This platform is projected to be superior to the traditional evolution methods since robust growth phenotypes can be selected for while maintaining selective pressure for magnetotaxis. We provide, herein, a quantitative basis for our platform including considerations of continuous evolution, sizing, and magnetic field pulsing. Our proposed fermentation process anticipates scalable production of 1 g/L per day of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles to enable industrial applications."

We also demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method on seven families of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). 4.

10.1101/023457,"We apply the statistical framework for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to eigenvector decomposition (EigenGWAS), which is commonly used in population genetics to characterise the structure of genetic data. The approach does not require discrete sub-populations and thus it can be utilized in any genetic data where the underlying population structure is unknown, or where the interest is assessing divergence along a gradient. Through theory and simulation study we show that our approach can identify regions under selection along gradients of ancestry. In real data, we confirm this by demonstrating LCT to be under selection between HapMap CEU-TSI cohorts, and validated this selection signal across European countries in the POPRES samples. HERC2 was also found to be differentiated between both the CEU-TSI cohort and within the POPRES sample, reflecting the likely anthropological differences in skin and hair colour between northern and southern European populations. Controlling for population stratification is of great importance in any quantitative genetic study and our approach also provides a simple, fast, and accurate way of predicting principal components in independent samples. With ever increasing sample sizes across many fields, this approach is likely to be greatly utilized to gain individual-level eigenvectors avoiding the computational challenges associated with conducting singular value decomposition in large datasets. We have developed freely available software to facilitate the application of the methods."
10.1101/023390,"As a chromosome is sliced into pieces by recombination after entering an admixed population, ancestral tracks of chromosomes are shortened with the pasting of generations. The length distribution of ancestral tracks reflects information of recombination and thus can be used to infer the histories of admixed populations. Previous studies have shown that inference based on ancestral tracks is powerful in recovering the histories of admixed populations. However, population histories are always complex, and previous studies only deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under very simple admixture models. The deduction of length distribution of ancestral tracks under a more general model will greatly elevate the power in inferring population histories. Here we first deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under a general model in an admixed population, and proposed general principles in parameter estimation and model selection with the length distribution. Next, we focused on studying the length distribution of ancestral tracks and its applications under three typical admixture models, which were all special cases of our general model. Extensive simulations showed that the length distribution of ancestral tracks was well predicted by our theoretical models. We further developed a new method based on the length distribution of ancestral tracks and good performance was observed when it was applied in inferring population histories under the three typical models. Notably, our method was insensitive to demographic history, sample size and threshold to discard short tracks. Finally, we applied our method in African Americans and Mexicans from the HapMap dataset, and several South Asian populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project dataset. The results showed that the histories of African Americans and Mexicans matched the historical records well, and the population admixture history of South Asians was very complex and could be traced back to around 100 generations ago."
10.1101/023481,"Recurrent (e.g. parallel or convergent) evolution is widely cited as evidence for natural selections central role in evolution but can also highlight constraints affecting evolution. Here we describe the evolution of green and melanistic color phenotypes in two species of stick insect: Timema podura and T. cristinae. We show that similar color phenotypes of these species (1) cluster in phenotypic space and (2) confer crypsis on different plant microhabitats. We then use genome-wide association mapping to determine the genetic architecture of color in T. podura, and compare this to previous results in T. cristinae. In both species, color is under simple genetic control, dominance relationships of melanistic and green alleles are the same, and SNPs associated with color phenotypes colocalize to the same genomic region. These results differ from those of  typical parallel phenotypes because the form of selection acting on color differs between species: a balance of multiple sources of selection acting within host species maintains the color polymorphism in T. cristinae whereas T. podura color phenotypes are under divergent selection between hosts. Our results highlight how different adaptive landscapes can result in the evolution of similar phenotypic variation, and suggest the same genomic region is involved."
10.1101/023374,"1The inference of biological relatedness from DNA sequence data has a wide array of applications, such as in the study of human disease, anthropology and ecology. One of the most common analytical frameworks for performing this inference is to genotype individuals for large numbers of independent genomewide markers and use population allele frequencies to infer the probability of identity-by-descent (IBD) given observed genotypes. Current implementations of this class of methods assume genotypes are known without error. However, with the advent of 2nd generation sequencing data there are now an increasing number of situations where the confidence attached to a particular genotype may be poor because of low coverage. Such scenarios may lead to biased estimates of the kinship coefficient,{varepsilon} We describe an approach that utilizes genotype likelihoods rather than a single observed best genotype to estimate{phi} and demonstrate that we can accurately infer relatedness in both simulated and real 2nd generation sequencing data from a wide variety of human populations down to at least the third degree when coverage is as low as 2x for both individuals, while other commonly used methods such as PLINK exhibit large biases in such situations. In addition the method appears to be robust when the assumed population allele frequencies are diverged from the true frequencies for realistic levels of genetic drift. This approach has been implemented in the C++ software lcMLkin."
10.1101/023564,"The flagellum is a large proteinaceous organelle found at the surface of many bacteria, whose primary role is to allow motility through the rotation of a long extracellular filament. It is an essential virulence factor in many pathogenic species, and is also a priming component in the formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms. The flagellum consists of the export apparatus and stator in the cytosol; the basal body, spanning the bacterial membrane(s) and periplasm; and the hook-filament, that protrudes away from the bacterial surface. Assembly of the bacterial flagellum is initiated by the formation of the basal body MS ring region, constituted of multiple copies of the protein FliF. Here, I report an analysis of the FliF sequence from various bacterial species, demonstrating that its periplasmic region is composed of a domain homologuous to that of the type III secretion system proteins PrgK, and of a second globular domain that possesses a similar fold to that of the sporulation complex component SpoIIIAG. I also describe that Chlamydia possesses an unusual FliF protein, lacking part of the PrgK homology domain and the SpoIIIAG-like domain, and fused to FliG at its C-terminus. Finally, I have combined the sequence analysis of FliF with the EM map of the MS ring, to propose the first atomic model for the FliF oligomer. These results further emphasize the similarity between the flagellum, T3SS and sporulation complex, and will facilitate further structural studies."

10.1101/023499,"What are the structural determinants of protein sequence evolution? A number of site-specific structural characteristics have been proposed, most of which are broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent accessibility of individual residues. Most importantly, there has been disagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent accessibility and local packing density for explaining site-specific sequence variability in proteins. We show here that this discussion has been confounded by the definition of local packing density. The most commonly used measures of local packing, such as the contact number and the weighted contact number, represent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and longer-range effects. As an alternative, we here propose a truly local measure of packing density around a single residue, based on the Voronoi cell volume. We show that the Voronoi cell volume, when calculated relative to the geometric center of amino-acid side chains, behaves nearly identically to the relative solvent accessibility, and both can explain, on average, approximately 34% of the site-specific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of 209 enzymes. An additional 10% of variation can be explained by non-local effects that are captured in the weighted contact number. Consequently, evolutionary variation at a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate amino-acid neighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids. We conclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing density, future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate contacts and longer-range effects on evolutionary variation."
10.1101/023549,"ObjectivesThe evolution of resistance against antimicrobial peptides has long been considered unlikely due to their mechanism of action, yet experimental selection with AMPs results in rapid evolution of resistance in several species of bacteria. Although numerous studies have utilized mutant screens to identify loci that determine AMP susceptibility, there is a dearth of data concerning the genomic changes which accompany experimental evolution of AMP resistance.\n\nMethodsUsing genome re-sequencing we analysed the mutations which arise during experimental evolution of resistance to the cationic AMPs iseganan, melittin and pexiganan, as well as to a combination of melittin and pexiganan, or to the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin.\n\nResultsAnalysis of 17 independently replicated Staphylococcus aureus selection lines, including unselected controls, showed that each AMP selected for mutations at distinct loci. We identify mutations in genes involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the cell envelope. This includes genes previously identified from mutant screens for AMP resistance, and genes involved in the response to AMPs and cell-wall-active antibiotics. Furthermore, transposon insertion mutants were used to verify that a number of the identified genes are directly involved in determining AMP susceptibility.\n\nConclusionsStrains selected for AMP resistance under controlled experimental evolution displayed consistent AMP-specific mutations in genes which determine AMP susceptibility. This suggests that different routes to evolve resistance are favored within a controlled genetic background."

10.1101/023515,"In proteomics, a large proportion of mass spectrometry (MS) data is ignored due to the lack of, or insufficient statistical evidence for mappable peptides. In reality, only a small fraction of features are expected to be differentially relevant anyway. Mapping spectra to peptides and subsequently, proteins, produces uncertainty at several levels. We propose it is better to analyze proteomic profiling data directly at MS level, and then relate these features to peptides/proteins. In a renal cancer data comprising 12 normal and 12 cancer subjects, we demonstrate that a simple rule-based binning approach can give rise to informative features. We note that the peptides associated with significant spectral bins gave rise to better class separation than the corresponding proteins, suggesting a loss of signal in the peptide-to-protein transition. Additionally, the binning approach sharpens focus on relevant protein splice forms rather than just canonical sequences. Taken together, the inverted raw spectra analysis paradigm, which is realised by the MZ-Bin method described in this article, provides new possibilities and insights, in how MS-data can be interpreted."

The indices were analysed in trunk muscle at biochemical (RNA/DNA, R/D), histological (percentage of muscle fibre separation, MFS) and morphometric (size-standardised body depth at the anus level, DAZ) level. No index was correlated with muscle length in the fed treatment regardless the period analysed (before or after full external feeding). The R/D was the only index that could detect past feeding differences in larvae [&le;] 13 DAH. For larvae > 13 DAH, MFS, R/D and DAZ in that order, yielded the best discrimination among treatments. For late-feeding larvae, latency was two days (R/D) and two-four days (MFS). Dynamics of recovery after food addition was also similar for R/D and MFS. Significant relationships between muscle growth and R/D or MFS were only found in larvae > 13 DAH. Both R/D and MFS encompassed the mass mortality event observed in non-fed larvae at 17 DAH.

10.1101/023507,"Although a large number of methods exist to control the dynamics of populations to a desired state, few of them have been empirically validated. This limits the scope of using these methods in real-life scenarios. To address this issue, we tested the efficacy of two well-known control methods in enhancing different kinds of stability in highly fluctuating, extinction-prone populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The Upper Limiter Control (ULC) method was able to reduce the fluctuations in population sizes as well as the extinction probability of the populations. On the negative side, it had no effect on the effective population size and required a large amount of effort. On the other hand, Lower Limiter Control (LLC) enhanced effective population size and reduced extinction probability at a relatively low amount of effort. However, its effects on population fluctuations were equivocal. We examined the population size distributions with and without the control methods, to derive biologically intuitive explanations for how these control methods work. We also show that biologically-realistic simulations, using a very general population dynamics model, are able to capture most of the trends of our data. This suggests that our results are likely to be generalizable to a wide range of scenarios."

And we showed that, under some conditions, the ab initio probability of an alignment can be factorized into the product of an overall factor and contributions from regions (or local alignments) separated by gapless columns.\n\nResultsThis paper describes how our ab initio perturbative formulation can be concretely used to approximately calculate the probabilities of all types of local pairwise alignments (PWAs) and some typical types of local multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). For each local alignment type, we calculated the fewest-indel contribution and the next-fewest-indel contribution to its probability, and we compared them under various conditions. We also derived a system of integral equations that can be numerically solved to give \""exact solutions\"" for some common types of local PWAs. And we compared the obtained \""exact solutions\"" with the fewest-indel contributions. The results indicated that even the fewest-indel terms alone can quite accurately approximate the probabilities of local alignments, as long as the segments and the branches in the tree are of modest lengths. Moreover, in the light of our formulation, we examined parameter regions where other indel models can safely approximate the correct evolutionary probabilities. The analyses also suggested some modifications necessary for these models to improve the accuracy of their probability estimations.\n\nConclusionsAt least under modest conditions, our ab initio perturbative formulation can quite accurately calculate alignment probabilities under biologically realistic indel models. It also provides a sound reference point that other indel models can be compared to.

10.1101/023655,"Life history invariants play a pivotal role in the study of social adaptation: they provide theoretical hypotheses that can be empirically tested, and benchmark frameworks against which new theoretical developments can be understood. Here we derive a novel invariant for dispersal evolution: the \""constant philopater hypothesis\"" (CPH). Specifically, we find that, irrespective of variation in maternal fecundity, all mothers are favoured to produce exactly the same number of philopatric offspring, with high-fecundity mothers investing proportionally more, and low-fecundity mothers investing proportionally less, into dispersing offspring. This result holds for female and male dispersal, under haploid, diploid and haplodiploid modes of inheritance, irrespective of the sex ratio, local resource availability, and whether mother or offspring controls the latters dispersal propensity. We explore the implications of this result for evolutionary conflicts of interest - and the exchange and withholding of contextual information - both within and between families, and we show that the CPH is the fundamental invariant that underpins and explains a wider family of invariance relationships that emerge from the study of social evolution."
10.1101/023598,"BackgroundInsertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, such probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions.\n\nResultsHere, we theoretically tackle the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model allows general indel rate parameters including length distributions but does not impose any unrealistic restrictions on indels. Using techniques of the perturbation theory in physics, we expand the probability into a series over different numbers of indels. Our derivation of this perturbation expansion elegantly bridges the gap between Gillespies (1977) intuitive derivation of his own stochastic simulation method, which is now widely used in evolutionary simulators, and Fellers (1940) mathematically rigorous theorems that underpin Gillespie's method. We find a sufficient and nearly necessary set of conditions under which the probability can be expressed as the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment. The indel models satisfying these conditions include those with some kind of rate variation across regions, as well as space-homogeneous models. We also prove that, though with a caveat, pairwise probabilities calculated by the method of Miklos et al. (2004) are equivalent to those calculated by our ab initio formulation, at least under a space-homogenous model.\n\nConclusionsOur ab initio perturbative formulation provides a firm theoretical ground that other indel models can rest on.\n\n[This paper and three other papers (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a,b,c) describe a series of our efforts to develop, apply, and extend the ab initio perturbative formulation of a general continuous-time Markov model of indels.]"

In a separate paper (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a), we established an ab initio perturbative formulation of a continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. And we showed that, under a certain set of conditions, the ab initio probability of an alignment can be factorized into the product of an overall factor and contributions from regions (or local alignments) separated by gapless columns. Moreover, in another separate paper (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015b), we performed concrete perturbation analyses on all types of local pairwise alignments (PWAs) and some typical types of local multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The analyses indicated that even the fewest-indel terms alone can quite accurately approximate the probabilities of local alignments, as long as the segments and the branches in the tree are of modest lengths.\n\nResultsTo examine whether or not the fewest-indel terms alone can well approximate the alignment probabilities of more general types of local MSAs as well, and as a first step toward the automatic application of our ab initio perturbative formulation, we developed an algorithm that calculates the first approximation of the probability of a given MSA under a given parameter setting including a phylogenetic tree. The algorithm first chops the MSA into gapped and gapless segments, second enumerates all parsimonious indel histories potentially responsible for each gapped segment, and finally calculates their contributions to the MSA probability. We performed validation analyses using more than ten million local MSAs. The results indicated that even the first approximation can quite accurately estimate the probability of each local MSA, as long as the gaps and tree branches are at most moderately long.\n\nConclusionsThe newly developed algorithm, called LOLIPOG, brought our ab initio perturbation formulation at least one step closer to a practically useful method to quite accurately calculate the probability of a MSA under a given biologically realistic parameter setting.\n\n[This paper and three other papers (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a,b,c) describe a series of our efforts to develop, apply, and extend the ab initio perturbative formulation of a general continuous-time Markov model of indels.]"

We give a sufficient set of conditions that the probability of evolution via both indels and substitutions is factorable into the product of an overall factor and local contributions.

10.1101/023473,"Many classical ecological and evolutionary theoretical frameworks posit that competition between species is an important selective force. For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative datasets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum-likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity-dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution. More generally, it constitutes a step toward a better integration of interspecific interactions in many ecological and evolutionary processes."
10.1101/023440,"Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found more than a hundred common susceptibility alleles for prostate cancer, the GWAS reported variants jointly explain only 33% of risk to siblings, leaving the majority of the familial risk unexplained. We use targeted sequencing of 63 known GWAS risk regions in 9,237 men from four ancestries (African, Latino, Japanese, and European) to explore the role of low-frequency variation in risk for prostate cancer. We find that the sequenced variants explain significantly more of the variance in the trait than the known GWAS variants, thus showing that part of the missing familial risk lies in poorly tagged causal variants at known risk regions. We report evidence for genetic heterogeneity in SNP effect sizes across different ancestries. We also partition heritability by minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum using variance components methods, and find that a large fraction of heritability (0.12, s.e. 0.05; 95% CI [0.03, 0.21]) is explained by rare variants (MAF<0.01) in men of African ancestry. We use the heritability attributable to rare variants to estimate the coupling between selection and allelic effects at 0.48 (95% CI of [0.19, 0.78]) under the Eyre-Walker model. These results imply that natural selection has driven down the frequency of many prostate cancer risk alleles over evolutionary history. Overall our results show that a substantial fraction of the risk for prostate cancer in men of African ancestry lies in rare variants at known risk loci and suggests that rare variants make a significant contribution to heritability of common traits."
10.1101/023648,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven a valuable tool to explore the genetic basis of many traits. However, many GWAS lack statistical power and the commonly used single-point analysis method needs to be complemented to enhance power and interpretation. Multivariate region or gene-wide association are an alternative, allowing for identification of disease genes in a manner more robust to allelic heterogeneity. Gene-based association also facilitates systems biology analyses by generating a single p-value per gene. We have designed and implemented FORGE, a software suite which implements a range of methods for the combination of p-values for the individual genetic variants within a gene or genomic region. The software can be used with summary statistics (marker ids and p-values) and accepts as input the result file formats of commonly used genetic association software. When applied to a study of Crohns disease susceptibility, it identified all genes found by single SNP analysis and additional genes identified by large independent metaanalysis. FORGE p-values on gene-set analyses highlighted association with the Jak-STAT and cytokine signalling pathways, both previously associated with CD. We highlight the softwares main features, its future development directions and provide a comparison with alternative available software tools.

10.1101/023531,"A long-standing problem is how memories can be stored for very long times despite the volatility of the underlying neural substrate, most notably the high turnover of dendritic spines and synapses. To address this problem, here we are using a generic and simple probabilistic model for the creation and removal of synapses. We show that information can be stored for several months when utilizing the intrinsic dynamics of multi-synapse connections. In such systems, single synapses can still show high turnover, which enables fast learning of new information, but this will not perturb prior stored information (slow forgetting), which is represented by the compound state of the connections. The model matches the time course of recent experimental spine data during learning and memory in mice supporting the assumption of multi-synapse connections as the basis for long-term storage.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt is widely believed that information is stored in the connectivity, i.e. the synapses of neural networks. Yet, the morphological correlates of excitatory synapses, the dendritic spines, have been found to undergo a remarkable turnover on daily basis. This poses the question, how information can be retained on such a variable substrate.\n\nIn this study, using connections with multiple synapses, we show that connections which follow the experimentally measured bimodal distribution in the number of synapses can store information orders of magnitude longer than the lifetime of a single synapse. This is a consequence of the underlying bistable collective dynamic of multiple synapses: Single synapses can appear and disappear without disturbing the memory as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, increasing or decreasing neural activity changes the distribution of the number of synapses of multi-synaptic connections such that only one of the peaks remains. This leads to a desirable property: information about these altered activities can be stored much faster than it is forgotten. Remarkably, the resulting model dynamics match recent experimental data investigating the long-term effect of learning on the dynamics of dendritic spines."
10.1101/023523,"In cognitive neuroscience, electrical brain activity is most commonly recorded at the scalp. In order to infer the contributions and connectivity of underlying neuronal sources within the brain, it is necessary to reconstruct sensor data at the source level. Several approaches to this reconstruction have been developed, thereby solving the so-called implicit inverse problem (Michel et al. 2004). However, a unifying premise against which to validate these source reconstructions is seldom available. The dataset provided in this work, in which brain activity is simultaneously recorded on the scalp (non-invasively) by electroencephalography (EEG) and on the cortex (invasively) by electrocorticography (ECoG), can be of a great help in this direction. These multimodal recordings were obtained from a macaque monkey under wakefulness and sedation. Our primary goal was to establish the connectivity architecture between two sources of interest (frontal and parietal), and to assess how their coupling changes over the conditions. We chose these sources because previous studies have shown that the connections between them are modified by anaesthesia (Boly et al. 2012). Our secondary goal was to evaluate the consistency of the connectivity results when analyzing sources recorded from invasive data (128 implanted ECoG sources) and source activity reconstructed from scalp recordings (19 EEG sensors) at the same locations as the ECoG sources. We conclude that the directed connectivity in the frequency domain between cortical sources reconstructed from scalp EEG is qualitatively similar to the connectivity inferred directly from cortical recordings, using both data-driven (directed transfer function; DTF) and biologically grounded (dynamic causal modelling; DCM) methods. Furthermore, the connectivity changes identified were consistent with previous findings (Boly et al. 2012). Our findings suggest that inferences about directed connectivity based upon non-invasive electrophysiological data have construct validity in relation to invasive recordings."
10.1101/023556,"Reducing insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) levels or administration of IGF-I show beneficial effects in the brain. We now provide evidence to help resolve this paradox. The unliganded IGF-IR inhibits glucose uptake by astrocytes while its stimulation with IGF-I, in concert with insulin activation of the insulin receptor, produces the opposite effect. In vivo imaging showed that shRNA interference of brain IGF-IR increased glucose uptake by astrocytes while pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR reduced it. Brain 18FGlucose-PET of IGF-IR shRNA injected mice confirmed an inhibitory role of unliganded IGF-IR on glucose uptake, whereas glucose-dependent recovery of neuronal activity in brain slices was blunted by pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR. Mechanistically, we found that the unliganded IGF-IR retains glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), the main glucose transporter in astrocytes, inside the cell while IGF-I, in cooperation with insulin, synergistically stimulates MAPK/PKD to promote association of IGF-IR with GLUT 1 via Rac1/GIPC1 and increases GLUT1 availability at the cell membrane. These findings identify IGF-I and its receptor as antagonistic modulators of brain glucose uptake."
10.1101/023697,"Biological organisms rely on their ability to sense and respond appropriately to their environment. The molecular mechanisms that facilitate these essential processes are however subject to a range of random effects and stochastic processes, which jointly affect the reliability of information transmission between receptors and e.g. the physiological downstream response. Information is mathematically defined in terms of the entropy; and the extent of information flowing across an information channel or signalling system is typically measured by the \""mutual information\"", or the reduction in the uncertainty about the output once the input signal is known. Here we quantify how extrinsic and intrinsic noise affect the transmission of simple signals along simple motifs of molecular interaction networks. Even for very simple systems the effects of the different sources of variability alone and in combination can give rise to bewildering complexity. In particular extrinsic variability is apt to generate \""apparent\"" information that can in extreme cases mask the actual information that for a single system would flow between the different molecular components making up cellular signalling pathways. We show how this artificial inflation in apparent information arises and how the effects of different types of noise alone and in combination can be understood."
10.1101/023663,"Examples of phenotypic convergence in plumage coloration have been reported in a wide diversity of avian taxonomic groups, yet the underlying evolutionary mechanisms driving this phenomenon have received little scientific inquiry. Herein, we document a striking new case of plumage convergence in the Helmeted Woodpecker (Dryocopus galeatus) and explore the possibility of visual mimicry among Atlantic Forest woodpeckers. Our multi-locus phylogenetic analyses unequivocally place D. galeatus within Celeus, indicating the former has subsequently converged in appearance upon the distantly related and syntopic Dryocopus lineatus, to which it bears a remarkable resemblance in plumage coloration and pattern. Although details of the Helmeted Woodpeckers ecology and natural history are only now beginning to emerge, its smaller size and submissive behavior are consistent with predictions derived from evolutionary game theory models and the interspecific social dominance mimicry hypothesis (ISDM). Moreover, estimates of avian visual acuity suggest that size-related mimetic deception is plausible at distances ecologically relevant to Celeus and Dryocopus foraging behavior. In light of our results, we recommend taxonomic transfer of D. galeatus to Celeus and emphasize the need for detailed behavioral studies that examine the social costs and benefits of plumage convergence to explicitly test for ISDM and other forms of mimicry in these Atlantic Forest woodpecker communities. Future field studies examining potential cases of competitive mimicry should also take into account the mimics acoustic behavior, particularly in the presence of putative model species and other heterospecific competitors, as any discontinuity between morphological and behavioral mimicry would likely preclude the possibility of deception."
10.1101/023754,"SummaryTo evaluate and compare the performance of variant calling methods and their confidence scores, comparisons between a test call set and a \""gold standard\"" need to be carried out. Unfortunately, these comparisons are not straightforward with the current Variant Call Files (VCF), which are the standard output of most variant calling algorithms for high-throughput sequencing data. Comparisons of VCFs are often confounded by the different representations of indels, MNPs, and combinations thereof with SNVs in complex regions of the genome, resulting in misleading results. A variant caller is inherently a classification method designed to score putative variants with confidence scores that could permit controlling the rate of false positives (FP) or false negatives (FN) for a given application. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and the area under the ROC (AUC) are efficient metrics to evaluate a test call set versus a gold standard. However, in the case of VCF data this also requires a special accounting to deal with discrepant representations. We developed a novel algorithm for comparing variant call sets that deals with complex call representation discrepancies and through a dynamic programing method that minimizes false positives and negatives globally across the entire call sets for accurate performance evaluation of VCFs.\n\nAvailabilityRTG Tools is implemented as a multithreaded Java application and source code is available under BSD license at: https://github.com/RealTimeGenomics/rtg-tools\n\nContactlen@realtimegenomics.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
10.1101/023713,"Gynodioecy, the coexistence of females and hermaphrodites, occurs in 20% of angiosperm families and often enables transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy. Clarifying mechanisms of sex determination in gynodioecious species can thus illuminate sexual system evolution. Genetic determination of gynodioecy, however, can be complex and is not fully characterized in any wild species. We used targeted sequence capture to genetically map a novel nuclear contributor to male sterility in a self-pollinated hermaphrodite of Fragaria vesca subsp. bracteata from the southern portion of its range. To understand its interaction with another identified locus and possibly additional loci, we performed crosses within and between two populations separated by 2000 km, phenotyped the progeny and sequenced candidate markers at both sex-determining loci. The newly mapped locus contains a high density of pentatricopeptide repeat genes, a class commonly involved in restoration of fertility caused by cytoplasmic male sterility. Examination of all crosses revealed three unlinked epistatically interacting loci that determine sexual phenotype and vary in frequency between populations. Fragaria vesca subsp. bracteata represents the first wild gynodioecious species with genomic evidence of both cytoplasmic and nuclear genes in sex determination. We propose a model for the interactions between these loci and new hypotheses for the evolution of sex determining chromosomes in the subdioecious and dioecious Fragaria."
10.1101/023721,"In population genomics studies, accounting for the neutral covariance structure across population allele frequencies is critical to improve the robustness of genome-wide scan approaches. Elaborating on the BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWEO_SCPLOWNVC_SCPLOW model, this study investigates several modeling extensions i) to improve the estimation accuracy of the population covariance matrix and all the related measures; ii) to identify significantly overly differentiated SNPs based on a calibration procedure of the XtX statistics; and iii) to consider alternative covariate models for analyses of association with population-specific covariables. In particular, the auxiliary variable model allows to deal with multiple testing issues and, providing the relative marker positions are available, to capture some Linkage Disequilibrium information. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the performances of these different models. Also, when compared in terms of power, robustness and computational efficiency, to five other state-of-the-art genome scan methods (BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWEO_SCPLOWNVC_SCPLOW2, BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWCC_SCPLOWEO_SCPLOWNVC_SCPLOW, BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWSO_SCPLOWCANC_SCPLOW, FLK and LFMM) the proposed approaches proved highly effective. For illustration purpose, genotyping data on 18 French cattle breeds were analyzed leading to the identification of thirteen strong signatures of selection. Among these, four (surrounding the KITLG, KIT, EDN3 and ALB genes) contained SNPs strongly associated with the piebald coloration pattern while a fifth (surrounding PLAG1) could be associated to morphological differences across the populations. Finally, analysis of Pool-Seq data from 12 populations of Littorina saxatilis living in two different ecotypes illustrates how the proposed framework might help addressing relevant ecological issue in non-model species. Overall, the proposed methods define a robust Bayesian framework to characterize adaptive genetic differentiation across populations.

Whereas biomimetic approaches to neural decoding use motor imagery/observation signals, non-biomimetic approaches assign an arbirary transformation that maps neural activity to motor control signals. In this work, we present a unified framework for the design of both biomimetic and non-biomimetic decoders based on kernel-based system identification. This framework seamlessly incorporates the neural population dynamics in the decoder design, is particularly robust even with short training data records, and results in decoders with small filter delays. The theory and results presented here provide a new formulation of optimal linear decoding, a formal method for designing non-biomimetic decoders, and a set of proposed metrics for assessing decoding performance from an online control perspective.

10.1101/023846,"Like a moth into the flame - Phototaxis is an iconic example for innate preferences. Such preferences likely reflect evolutionary adaptations to predictable situations and have traditionally been conceptualized as hard-wired stimulus-response links. Perhaps therefore, the century-old discovery of flexibility in Drosophila phototaxis has received little attention. Here we report that across several different behavioral tests, light/dark preference tested in walking is dependent on various aspects of flight. If we temporarily compromise flying ability, walking photopreference reverses concomitantly. Neuronal activity in circuits expressing dopamine and octopamine, respectively, plays a differential role in photopreference, suggesting a potential involvement of these biogenic amines in this case of behavioral flexibility. We conclude that flies monitor their ability to fly, and that flying ability exerts a fundamental effect on action selection in Drosophila. This work suggests that even behaviors which appear simple and hard-wired comprise a value-driven decision-making stage, negotiating the external situation with the animals internal state, before an action is selected."

Previous approaches describe data with simple summary statistics and kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the difference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture complicated underlying structure, and a kernel functions-based approach lacks interpretability of results.\n\nResults: We propose a novel method D3M, for detection of differential distribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data.

10.1101/023804,"Comparative and evolutive ecologists are interested in the distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The classical framework for these distributions consists of a random process running along the branches of a phylogenetic tree relating the species. We consider shifts in the process parameters, which reveal fast adaptation to changes of ecological niches. We show that models with shifts are not identifiable in general. Constraining the models to be parsimonious in the number of shifts partially alleviates the problem but several evolutionary scenarios can still provide the same joint distribution for the extant species. We provide a recursive algorithm to enumerate all the equivalent scenarios and to count the effectively different scenarios. We introduce an incomplete-data framework and develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure based on the EM algorithm. Finally, we propose a model selection procedure, based on the cardinal of effective scenarios, to estimate the number of shifts and prove an oracle inequality."
10.1101/023788,"A long-standing question in evolutionary biology is whether the evolution of convergent phenotypes results from selection on the same heritable genetic components. Using whole genome sequencing and genome scans, we tested whether the evolution of parallel longitudinal flowering time clines in the native and introduced ranges of Arabidopsis thaliana has a similar genetic basis. We found that common variants of large effect on flowering time in the native range do not appear to have been under recent strong selection in the introduced range. Genes in regions of the genome that are under selection for flowering time are also not enriched for functions related to development or environmental sensing. We instead identified a set of 53 new candidate genes putatively linked to the evolution of flowering time in the species introduced range. A high degree of conditional neutrality of flowering time variants between the native and introduced range may preclude parallel evolution at the level of genes. Overall, neither gene pleiotropy nor available standing genetic variation appears to have restricted the evolution of flowering time in the introduced range to high frequency variants from the native range or to known flowering time pathway genes."
10.1101/023887,"Transposons are mobile genetic elements that are found in nearly all organisms, including humans. Mobilization of DNA transposons by transposase enzymes can cause genomic rearrangements, but our knowledge of human genes derived from transposases is limited. Here, we find that the protein encoded by human PGBD5, the most evolutionarily conserved transposable element-derived gene in chordates, can induce stereotypical cut-and-paste DNA transposition in human cells. Genomic integration activity of PGBD5 requires distinct aspartic acid residues in its transposase domain, and specific DNA sequences with inverted terminal repeats with similarity to piggyBac transposons. DNA transposition catalyzed by PGBD5 in human cells occurs genome-wide, with precise transposon excision and preference for insertion at TTAA sites. The apparent conservation of DNA transposition activity by PGBD5 raises the possibility that genomic remodeling may contribute to its biological function."

In particular, gene trees and species trees can truly differ due to well-known evolutionary processes like gene duplication and loss, lateral gene transfer or incomplete lineage sorting. Different species tree reconstruction methods have been developed to take this incongruence into account, which can be divided grossly into supertree and supermatrix approaches. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian hierarchical model that we have recently developed and implemented in the program Guenomu, that considers multiple sources of gene tree/species tree disagreement. Guenomu takes as input the posterior distributions of unrooted gene tree topologies for multiple gene families, in order to estimate the posterior distribution of rooted species tree topologies."
10.1101/023929,"Insert size distributions from paired read protocols are used for inference in bioinformatic applications such as genome assembly and structural variation detection. However, many of the models that are being used are subject to bias. This bias arises when we assume that all insert sizes within a distribution are equally likely to be observed, when in fact, size matters. These systematic errors exist in popular software even when the assumptions made about data are true. We have previously shown that bias occurs for scaffolders in genome assembly. Here, we generalize the theory and demonstrate that it is applicable in other contexts. We provide examples of bias in state-of the-art software and improve them using our model. One key application of our theory is structural variation detection using read pairs. We show that an incorrect null-hypothesis is commonly used in popular tools and can be corrected using our theory. Furthermore, we approximate the smallest size of indels that are possible to discover given an insert size distribution. Two other applications are inference of insert size distribution on \emph{de novo} genome assemblies and error correction of genome assemblies using mated reads. Our theory is implemented in a tool called GetDistr (\url{https://github.com/ksahlin/GetDistr})."
10.1101/023903,"The evidence for universal common ancestry (UCA) is vast and persuasive, and a phylogenetic test was proposed for quantifying its odds against independently originated sequences based on the comparison between one and several trees [1]. This test was successfully applied to a well-supported homologous sequence alignment, being however criticized once simulations showed that even alignments without any phylogenetic structure could mislead its conclusions [2]. Despite claims to the contrary [3], we believe that the counterexample successfully showed a drawback of the test, of relying on good alignments.\n\nHere we present a simplified version of this counterexample, which can be interpreted as a tree with arbitrarily long branches, and where the test again fails. We also present another simulation showing circumstances whereby any sufficiently similar alignment will favor UCA irrespective of the true independent origins for the sequences. We therefore conclude that the test should not be trusted unless convergence has already been ruled out a priori. Finally, we present a class of frequentist tests that perform better than the purportedly formal UCA test."
10.1101/023739,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a prototypic heritable adult human progeroid syndrome in which signs of premature aging are associated with genetic instability and an elevated risk of specific types of cancer. We have quantified mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression in WS patient fibroblasts, and in WRN-depleted fibroblasts. Genes down-regulated in WS patient fibroblasts were highly enriched in G-quadruplex (G4) DNA motifs. The strength, location and strand specificity of this association provide strong experimental evidence that G4 motifs or motif-dependent G-quadruplexes are bound by WRN in human cells to modulate gene expression. The expression of many miRNAs was perturbed by loss of WRN function. WRN depletion altered the expression of >500 miRNAs. miRNAs linked to cell signaling, genome stability assurance and tumorigenesis were among the small number of these miRNAs that were persistently altered in WS patient fibroblasts. An unexpected and highly distinct finding in WS cells was the coordinate over-expression of nearly all cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases and their associated AIMP proteins. Our results provide new insight into WS pathogenesis, and identify therapeutically accessible mechanisms that may drive disease pathogenesis in WS and in the general population."
10.1101/023911,"Introduction: A cells epigenome arises from interactions among regulatory factors -- transcription factors, histone modifications, and other DNA-associated proteins -- co-localized at particular genomic regions. Identifying the network of interactions among regulatory factors, the chromatin network, is of paramount importance in understanding epigenome regulation.\n\nMethods: We developed a novel computational approach, ChromNet, to infer the chromatin network from a set of ChIP-seq datasets. ChromNet has four key features that enable its use on large collections of ChIP-seq data. First, rather than using pairwise co-localization of factors along the genome, ChromNet identifies conditional dependence relationships that better discriminate direct and indirect interactions. Second, our novel statistical technique, the group graphical model, improves inference of conditional dependence on highly correlated datasets. Such datasets are common because some transcription factors form a complex and the same transcription factor is often assayed in different laboratories or cell types. Third, ChromNets computationally efficient method and the group graphical model enable the learning of a joint network across all cell types, which greatly increases the scope of possible interactions. We have shown that this results in a significantly higher fold enrichment for validated protein interactions. Fourth, ChromNet provides an efficient way to identify the genomic context that drives a particular network edge, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of regulatory factor interactions.\n\nResults: We applied ChromNet to all available ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Project, consisting of 1451 ChIP-seq datasets, which revealed previously known physical interactions better than alternative approaches. ChromNet also identified previously unreported regulatory factor interactions. We experimentally validated one of these interactions, between the MYC and HCFC1 transcription factors.\n\nDiscussion: ChromNet provides a useful tool for understanding the interactions among regulatory factors and identifying novel interactions. We have provided an interactive web-based visualization of the full ENCODE chromatin network and the ability to incorporate custom datasets at http://chromnet.cs.washington.edu."

(2002) could establish a positive correlation between the production of 24nt GFP small interfering (si)RNAs in infiltrated leaves and the systemic onset of GFP silencing in remote tissues. In the context of GFP silencing inducers based on replicating Potato virus X (PVX), the P25 protein of PVX was found to specifically inhibit the local accumulation of 24nt GFP siRNAs. In the original paper, there were background pixel pattern duplications in the figure reporting the P25 experiments. We have now repeated these experiments with the original clones and the results presented here confirm those reported in the original paper."
10.1101/023986,"Species may evolve on a reticulate network due to hybridization or other gene flow rather than on a strictly bifurcating tree, but comparative methods to deal with trait evolution on a network are lacking. We create such a method, which uses a Brownian motion model. Our method seeks to separately or jointly detect a bias in trait value coming from hybridization ({beta}) and a burst of variation at the time of hybridization (vH) associated with the hybridization event, as well as traditional Brownian motion parameters of ancestral state () and rate of evolution ({sigma}2) of Brownian motion, as well as measurement error of the tips (SE). We test the method with extensive simulations. We also apply the model to two empirical examples, cichlid body size and Nicotiana drought tolerance, and find substantial measurement error and a hint that hybrids have greater drought tolerance in the latter case. The new methods are available in CRAN R package BMhyd."
10.1101/023838,"Science outreach has become increasingly important for researchers and needs to be of ever improving quality, although the time available aside our science, teaching and administration activities is steadily decreasing. To square this circle, effective strategies are required. Here we argue that this can be achieved by setting simple but ambitious overarching objectives for comprehensive outreach initiatives which target multiple audiences, supported by cumulative build-up of shared high-quality resources, as well as the exchange and collaboration amongst scientists with a common outreach aim. To exemplify this strategy, we explain the low-budget, yet high-quality outreach initiative of the Manchester Fly Facility which aims to promote public awareness of the importance of the model organism Drosophila for biomedical research. (1) This initiative targets the general public at science fairs, through public videos, or through extracurricular activities in schools as well as the development of curriculum-relevant sample lessons for teachers - all supported by a dedicated website. (2) The initiative targets university students: by adapting the public outreach resources for their teaching, and through newly developed advanced training strategies that amalgamate the outreach objectives. (3) It targets fellow scientists through blogs, conference presentations and a second website that provides a one-stop-shop for resources, arguments and strategies. As will be explained, this multi-pronged approach is time-saving in the long run and it is powerful because it reaches a wide range of audiences, helps to gain momentum, to build resource, and to gradually improve quality through cross-fertilisation between different activities, and through exchange within the science community. This helps to build communities, and high-quality outreach will have further important added value: arguments that impress the public, tend to be most effective also with reviewers and grant panel members, and often help to readjust aspects of your own scientific work."
10.1101/023994,"Protein secondary and tertiary structure is modeled as a linear passive analog lumped electrical circuit. Modeling is based on the structural similarity between helix, sheet, turn/loop, and helix pair in proteins and inductor, capacitor, resistor, and transformer in electrical circuits; it includes methods from circuit analysis and synthesis. A  protein circuit is a one-port with a restrictive circuit topology (for example, the circuit for a secondary structure cannot be a Foster II ladder or a Wheatstone-like bridge). It has a rational positive real impedance function whose pole-zero distribution serves as a compact descriptor of secondary and tertiary structure, which is reminiscent of the Ramachandran plot. Standard circuit analysis methods such as node/loop equations and pole-zero maps may be used to study differences at the secondary and tertiary levels within and across proteins. Pairs of interacting proteins can be modeled as two-ports and studied via transfer functions. Similarly circuit synthesis methods can be used to construct  protein circuits whose real counterparts may or may not exist. An analysis example shows how a  protein circuit is constructed for thioredoxin and its pole-zero map obtained. A synthesis example shows how an electrical circuit with a single Brune section is obtained from a specified set of poles and zeros and then mapped to an artificial protein with a helix pair (corresponding to the transformer in the Brune section). Possible applications to folding, drug design, and visualization are indicated."
10.1101/023978,"Several strategies have been proposed to assign substitution models in phylogenomic datasets, or partitioning. The accuracy of these methods, and most importantly, their impact on phylogenetic estimation has not been thoroughly assessed using computer simulations. We simulated multiple partitioning scenarios to benchmark two a priori partitioning schemes (one model for the whole alignment, one model for each data block), and two statistical approaches (hierarchical clustering and greedy) implemented in PartitionFinder and in our new program, PartitionTest. Most methods were able to identify optimal partitioning schemes closely related to the true one. Greedy algorithms identified the true partitioning scheme more frequently than the clustering algorithms, but selected slightly less accurate partitioning schemes and tended to underestimate the number of partitions. PartitionTest was several times faster than PartitionFinder, with equal or better accuracy. Importantly, maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference was very robust to the partitioning scheme. Best-fit partitioning schemes resulted in optimal phylogenetic performance, without appreciable differences compared to the use of the true partitioning scheme. However, accurate trees were also obtained by a \""simple\"" strategy consisting of assigning independent GTR+G models to each data block. On the contrary, leaving the data unpartitioned always diminished the quality of the trees inferred, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the simulated scenario. The analysis of empirical data confirmed these trends, although suggesting a stronger influence of the partitioning scheme. Overall, our results suggests that statistical partitioning, but also the a priori assignment of independent GTR+G models, maximize phylogenomic performance."
10.1101/024000,"In addition to coding for proteins, exons can also impact transcription by encoding regulatory elements such as enhancers. It has been debated whether such features confer heightened selective constraint, or evolve neutrally. We have addressed this question by developing a new approach to disentangle the sources of selection acting on exonic enhancers, in which we model the evolutionary rates of every possible substitution as a function of their effects on both protein sequence and enhancer activity. In three exonic enhancers, we found no significant association between evolutionary rates and effects on enhancer activity. This suggests that despite having biochemical activity, these exonic enhancers have no detectable selective constraint, and thus are unlikely to play a major role in protein evolution."
10.1101/024018,"Plants sense foliar shade of competitors and alter their developmental programs through the shade avoidance response. Internode and petiole elongation, and changes in overall leaf area and leaf mass per area, are the stereotypical architectural responses to foliar shade in the shoot. However, changes in leaf shape and complexity in response to shade remain incompletely, and qualitatively, described. Using a meta-analysis of >18,000 previously published leaflet outlines, we demonstrate that shade avoidance alters leaf shape in domesticated tomato and wild relatives. The effects of shade avoidance on leaf shape are subtle with respect to individual traits, but are combinatorially strong. We then seek to describe the developmental origins of shade-induced changes in leaf shape by swapping plants between light treatments. Leaf size is light-responsive late into development, but patterning events, such as stomatal index, are irrevocably specified earlier.\n\nObserving that shade induces increases in shoot apical meristem size, we then describe gene expression changes in early leaf primordia and the meristem using laser microdissection. We find that in leaf primordia shade avoidance is not mediated through canonical pathways described in mature organs, but rather the expression of KNOX and other indeterminacy genes, altering known developmental pathways responsible for patterning leaf shape. We also demonstrate that shade-induced changes in leaf primordium gene expression largely do not overlap with those found in successively initiated leaf primordia, providing evidence against classic hypotheses that shaded leaf morphology results from prolonged production of juvenile leaf types."

10.1101/024059,"High throughput molecular profiling and integrated data analysis with tumor tissues require overcoming challenges like tumor heterogeneity and tissue paucity. This study is an attempt to understand and optimize various steps during tissue processing and in establishing pipelines essential for integrated analysis. Towards this effort, we subjected laryngo-pharyngeal primary tumors and the corresponding adjacent normal tissues (n=2) to two RNA and protein isolation methods, one wherein RNA and protein were isolated from the same tissue sequentially (Method 1) and second, wherein the extraction was carried out using two independent methods (Method 2). RNA and protein from both methods were subjected to RNA-seq and iTRAQ based LC-MS/MS analysis. Transcript and peptide identification and quantification was followed by both individual-ome and integrated data analysis. As a result of this analysis, we identified a higher number of total, as well as differentially expressed (DE) transcripts (1329 vs 1134) and proteins (799 vs 408) with fold change [&ge;] 2.0, in Method 1. Among these, 173 and 86 entities were identified by both transcriptome and proteome analysis in Method 1 and 2, respectively, with higher concordance in the regulation trends observed in the former. The significant cancer related pathways enriched with the individual DE transcript or protein data were similar in both the methods. However, the entities mapping to them were different, allowing enhanced view of the pathways identified after integration of the data and subsequent mapping. The concordant DE transcripts and proteins also revealed key molecules of the pathways with important roles in cancer development. This study thus demonstrates that sequential extraction of the RNA and proteins from the same tissue allows for better profiling of differentially expressed entities and a more accurate integrated data analysis.\n\nAuthor ContributionsARB, MKG, PK and SK contributed final data analysis.

10.1101/024026,"Characteristics of pseudogene degeneration at the coding level are well-known, such as a shift towards neutral rates of nonsynonymous substitutions and gain of frameshift mutations. In contrast, degeneration of pseudogene transcriptional regulation is not well understood. Here, we test two predictions of regulatory degeneration along the pseudogenized lineage: (1) decreased transcription factor binding and (2) accelerated evolution in putative cis-regulatory regions.\n\nWe find evidence for decreased TF binding levels nearby two primate pseudogenes compared to functional liver genes. We also find evidence for pseudogene-lineage-specific relaxation of sequence constraint on a fragment of the promoter of the primate pseudogene urate oxidase (Uox) and a nearby cis-regulatory module (CRM). However, the majority of TF-bound sequences nearby pseudogenes do not show evidence for lineage-specific accelerated rates of evolution. We conclude that decreases in TF binding level could be a marker for regulatory degeneration, while sequence degeneration in most CRMs may be obscured by background rates of TF binding site turnover."
10.1101/024042,"Clustering individuals to subpopulations based on genetic data has become commonplace in many genetic studies. Inference of population structure is most often done by applying model-based approaches, aided by visualization using distance-based approaches such as multidimensional scaling. While existing distance-based approaches suffer from lack of statistical rigor, model-based approaches entail assumptions of prior conditions such as that the subpopulations are at Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. Here we present a distance-based approach for inference of population structure using genetic data by defining population structure using network theory terminology and methods. A network is constructed from a pairwise genetic-similarity matrix of all sampled individuals. The community partition, a partition of a network to dense subgraphs, is equated with population structure, a partition of the population to genetically related groups. Community detection algorithms are used to partition the network into communities, interpreted as a partition of the population to subpopulations. The statistical significance of the structure can be estimated by using permutation tests to evaluate the significance of the partitions modularity, a network theory measure indicating the quality of community partitions. In order to further characterize population structure, a new measure of the Strength of Association (SA) for an individual to its assigned community is presented. The Strength of Association Distribution (SAD) of the communities is analyzed to provide additional population structure characteristics, such as the relative amount of gene flow experienced by the different subpopulations and identification of hybrid individuals. Human genetic data and simulations are used to demonstrate the applicability of the analyses. The approach presented here provides a novel, computationally efficient, model-free method for inference of population structure which does not entail assumption of prior conditions. The method is implemented in the software NetStruct, available at https://github.com/GiliG/NetStruct."
10.1101/024067,"Despite considerable efforts, known genetic associations only explain a small fraction of predicted heritability. Regional associations combine information from multiple contiguous genetic variants and can improve variance explained at established association loci. However, regional associations are not easily amenable to estimation using summary association statistics because of sensitivity to linkage disequilibrium (LD). We now propose a novel method to estimate phenotypic variance explained by regional associations using summary statistics while accounting for LD. Our method is asymptotically equivalent to multiple regression models when no interaction or haplotype effects are present. It has multiple applications, such as ranking of genetic regions according to variance explained or comparison of variance explained by to or more regions. Using height and BMI data from the Health Retirement Study (N=7,776), we show that most genetic variance lies in a small proportion of the genome and that previously identified linkage peaks have higher than expected regional variance."
10.1101/024158,"A digital approach to protein identification and quantity estimation using electrical measurements and database search is proposed. It is based on an electrolytic cell with two (three) nanopores and one (two) peptidase(s) covalently attached to the trans side of a pore. An unknown protein is digested by a reagent or peptidase into peptides ending in a known amino acid; the peptides enter the cell, pass through the first pore, and are fragmented by a high-specificity endopeptidase. The second enzyme, if present, is an exopeptidase that cleaves the fragments into single residues after the second pore. Level transitions in an ionic blockade or transverse current pulse due to residues in a fragment or individual pulses due to single residues are counted. This yields the positions of the endopeptidases target in the peptide, and, together with the peptides terminal residue, a partial sequence. Search through the Uniprot database for such sequences identifies over 90% of the proteins in the human proteome. The percentage can be increased by repeating the procedure with other reagents and cells specific to other residues, close to 100% may be possible. Sample purification to homogeneity is not required as the method applies to an arbitrary mixture of proteins; the quantity of a protein in the sample is estimated from the number of identifying peptides sensed over a long run. A Fokker-Planck model gives minimum enzyme turnover intervals required for ordered sensing of peptide fragments. With thick (80-100 nm) pores, required pulse resolution times are within the capability of CMOS detectors. The method can be implemented with existing technology; several related issues are discussed."
10.1101/022301,"MotivationIn order to discover quantitative trait loci (QTLs), multi-dimensional genomic data sets combining DNA-seq and ChiP-/RNA-seq require methods that rapidly correlate tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes with millions of genetic variants while appropriately controlling for multiple testing.\n\nResultsWe have developed FastQTL, a method that implements a popular cis-QTL mapping strategy in a user- and cluster-friendly tool. FastQTL also proposes an efficient permutation procedure to control for multiple testing.

10.1101/024109,"In the early days of HIV treatment, drug resistance occurred rapidly and predictably in all patients, but under modern treatments, resistance arises slowly, if at all. The probability of resistance should be controlled by the rate of generation of resistant mutations. If many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously, then adaptation proceeds by soft selective sweeps in which multiple adaptive mutations spread concomitantly, but if adaptive mutations occur rarely in the population, then a single adaptive mutation should spread alone in a hard selective sweep. Here we use 6,717 HIV-1 consensus sequences from patients treated with first-line therapies between 1989 and 2013 to confirm that the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed accompanied with the expected transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. This suggests more generally that evolution proceeds via hard sweeps if resistance is unlikely and via soft sweeps if it is likely."
10.1101/023820,"The tympanic ring, malleus and incus of the mammalian middle ear derive from the ancestral primary jaw joint of land vertebrates. In Mesozoic mammals, evolutionary detachment of the mammalian middle ear from the lower jaw occurred when Meckels cartilage - the last connection between the middle ear bones and the dentary - disappeared. This disappearance is famously recapitulated in early mammalian development. By extension, it was suggested that other developmental processes also recapitulate specific evolutionary processes that led to mammalian middle ear detachment in Mesozoic mammals. Specifically, developmental posterior/medial displacement and negative allometry of the growing ear ossicles relative to the lower jaw are thought to reflect evolutionary triggers of mammalian middle ear detachment. However, these hypotheses rest on scant developmental data, and have not been tested in a quantitative framework. Here we show, based on CT scans of developmental series of several marsupials and monotremes, that negative allometry of mammalian middle ear bones relative to the skull occurs only after mammalian middle ear detachment, ruling it out as a developmental detachment trigger. There is also no positional change of ectotympanic or malleus relative to the dentary. The mammalian middle ear bones are differently positioned in two monotreme species, a recent change which is not developmentally recapitulated. Together, our results challenge the developmental prerequisites of previously proposed evolutionary detachment processes, arguing specifically against causal links between mammalian middle ear detachment and brain expansion. Our data are more consistent with a biomechanical detachment trigger relating to the onset of dentary function, but more biomechanical work and palaeontological data are required to test this notion."
10.1101/024083,"Many genetic variants influence complex traits by modulating gene expression, thus altering the abundance levels of one or multiple proteins. In this work we introduce a powerful strategy that integrates gene expression measurements with large-scale genome-wide association data to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression is associated to complex traits. We use a relatively small reference panel of individuals for which both genetic variation and gene expression have been measured to impute gene expression into large cohorts of individuals and identify expression-trait associations. We extend our methods to allow for indirect imputation of the expression-trait association from summary association statistics of large-scale GWAS1-3. We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in [~]3,000 individuals overall. We then imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements4-6 to identify 69 novel genes significantly associated to obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids, and height). Many of the novel genes were associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. Overall our results showcase the power of integrating genotype, gene expression and phenotype to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits."
10.1101/024133,"With the great advances in ancient DNA extraction, population genetics data are now made of geographically separated individuals from both present and ancient times. However, population genetics theory about the joint effect of space and time has not been thoroughly studied. Based on the classical stepping-stone model, we develop the theory of Isolation by Distance and Time. We derive the correlation of allele frequencies between demes in the case where ancient samples are present in the data, and investigate the impact of edge effects with forward-in-time simulations. We also derive results about coalescent times in circular/toroidal models. As one of the most common way to investigate population structure is to apply principal component analysis, we evaluate the impact of this theory on plots of principal components. Our results demonstrate that time between samples is a non-negligible factor that requires new attention in population genetics."
10.1101/024182,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a great capacity for evolutionary adaptation to evade host immunity and develop drug resistance. Current understanding of parasite evolution is impeded by the fact that a large fraction of the genome is either highly repetitive or highly variable, and thus difficult to analyse using short read technologies. Here we describe a resource of deep sequencing data on parents and progeny from genetic crosses, which has enabled us to perform the first genome-wide, integrated analysis of SNP, INDEL and complex polymorphisms, using Mendelian error rates as an indicator of genotypic accuracy. These data reveal that INDELs are exceptionally abundant, being more common than SNPs and thus the dominant mode of polymorphism within the core genome. We use the high density of SNP and INDEL markers to analyse patterns of meiotic recombination, confirming a high rate of crossover events, and providing the first estimates for the rate of non-crossover events and the length of conversion tracts. We observe several instances of recombination that modify copy number variants associated with drug resistance, demonstrating a mechanism whereby fitness costs associated with resistance mutations could be compensated and greater phenotypic plasticity could be acquired. We describe a novel web application that allows these data to be explored in detail."
10.1101/024117,"The X chromosome, with its unique mode of inheritance, contributes to differences between the sexes at a molecular level, including sex-specific gene expression and sex-specific impact of genetic variation. We have conducted an analysis of the impact of both sex and the X chromosome on patterns of gene expression identified through transcriptome sequencing of whole blood from 922 individuals. We identified that genes on the X chromosome are more likely to have sex-specific expression compared to the autosomal genes. Furthermore, we identified a depletion of regulatory variants on the X chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated and connected sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants can inform sex differences in genetic disease prevalence, we have integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits and to identify traits with significant sex biases. Together, our study provides genome-wide insight into how the X chromosome and sex shape human gene regulation and disease."
10.1101/024216,"We describe an adaptation of {varphi}C31 integrase-mediated targeted cassette exchange for use in Drosophila cell lines. Single copies of an attP-bounded docking platform carrying a GFP-expression marker, with and without insulator elements flanking the attP sites, were inserted by P-element transformation into the Kc167 and Sg4 cell lines; each of the resulting docking site lines carries a single mapped copy of one of the docking platforms. Vectors for targeted substitution contain a cloning cassette flanked by attB sites. Targeted substitution occurs by integrase-mediated substitution between the attP sites (integrated) and the attB sites (vector). We describe procedures for isolating cells carrying the substitutions and for eliminating the products of secondary off-target events. We demonstrated the technology by integrating a cassette containing a Cu++-inducible mCherry marker, and we report the expression properties of those lines. When compared with clonal lines made by traditional transformation methods, which lead to the illegitimate insertion of tandem arrays, targeted insertion lines give more uniform expression, lower basal expression and higher induction ratios. Targeted substitution, though intricate, affords results that should greatly improve comparative expression assays - a major emphasis of cell-based studies."
10.1101/024232,"SummaryWe describe Manta, a method to discover structural variants and indels from next generation sequencing data. Manta is optimized for rapid clinical analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 minutes. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to basepair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.\n\nAvailabilityManta source code and Linux binaries are available from http://github.com/sequencing/manta.\n\nContactcsaunders@illumina.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
10.1101/024265,"Understanding the potential of animals to immediately respond to changing temperatures is imperative for predicting the effects of climate change on biodiversity. Ectothermic animals, such as insects, use behavioural thermoregulation to keep their body temperature within suitable limits. It may be particularly important at warm margins of species occurrence, where populations are sensitive to increasing air temperatures. In the field, we studied thermal requirements and behavioural thermoregulation in low-altitude populations of the Satyrinae butterflies Erebia aethiops, E. euryale and E. medusa. We compared the relationship of individual body temperature with air and microhabitat temperatures for the low-altitude Erebia species to our data on seven mountain species, including a high-altitude population of E. euryale, studied in the Alps. We found that the grassland butterfly E. medusa was well adapted to the warm lowland climate and it was active under the highest air temperatures and kept the highest body temperature of all species. Contrarily, the woodland species, E. aethiops and a low-altitude population of E. euryale, kept lower body temperatures and did not search for warm microclimates as much as other species. Furthermore, temperature-dependence of daily activities also differed between the three low-altitude and the mountain species. Lastly, the different responses to ambient temperature between the low- and high-altitude populations of E. euryale suggest possible local adaptations to different climates. We highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for long-term species survival, because it is expected to buffer climate change consequences by providing a variety of microclimates, which can be actively explored by adults. Alpine species can take advantage of warm microclimates, while low-altitude grassland species may retreat to colder microhabitats to escape heat, if needed. However, we conclude that lowland populations of woodland species may be more severely threatened by climate warming because of the unavailability of relatively colder microclimates."
10.1101/024257,"Accurate knowledge on the core components of substitution rates is of vital importance to understand genome evolution and dynamics. By performing a single-genome and direct analysis of 39894 retrotransposon remnants, we reveal germline sequence-dependent nucleotide substitution rates that can be assigned to each position in the human genome. Benefiting from the data made available in such detail, we show that a simulated genome, generated by equilibrating a random DNA sequence solely using our rate constants, exhibits nucleotide organisation close to that in the human genome. We next generate the germline basal substitution propensity (BSP) profile of the human genome and show a decreased tendency of moieties with low BSP to undergo somatic mutations in many cancer types."
10.1101/024281,"One of the foundational results of molecular evolution is that the rate at which neutral substitutions accumulate on a lineage equals the rate at which mutations arise. Traits that affect rates of mutation therefore also affect the phylogenetic \""molecular clock\"". We consider the effects of sex-specific generation times and mutation rates in species with two sexes. In particular, we focus on the effects that the age of onset of male puberty and rates of spermatogenesis have likely had in extant hominines (i.e., human, chimpanzee and gorilla), considering a model that approximates features of the mutational process in most mammals and birds and some other vertebrates. As we show, this model helps explain and reconcile a number of seemingly puzzling observations. In hominines, it can explain the puzzlingly low X-to-autosome ratios of substitution rates and how the ratios and rates of autosomal substitutions differ among lineages. Importantly, it suggests how to translate pedigree-based estimates of human mutation rates into split times among apes, given sex-specific life histories. In so doing, it helps bridge the gap between estimates of split times of apes based on fossil and molecular evidence. Finally, considering these effects can help to reconcile recent evidence that changes in generation times should have small effects on mutation rates in humans with classic studies suggesting that they have had major effects on rates of evolution in the mammalian phylogeny."
10.1101/024190,"Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) arise from retroviruses chromosomally integrated in the host germline. ERVs are common in vertebrate genomes and provide a valuable fossil record of past retroviral infections to investigate the biology and evolution of retroviruses over a deep time scale, including cross-species transmission events. Here we took advantage of a catalog of ERVs we recently produced for the bat Myotis lucifugus to seek evidence for infiltration of these retroviruses in other mammalian species (>100) currently represented in the genome sequence database. We provide multiple lines of evidence for the cross-ordinal transmission of a gammaretrovirus endogenized independently in the lineages of vespertilionid bats, felid cats and pangolin ~13-25 million years ago. Following its initial introduction, the ERV amplified extensively in parallel in both bat and cat lineages, generating hundreds of species-specific insertions throughout evolution. However, despite being derived from the same viral species, phylogenetic and selection analyses suggest that the ERV experienced different amplification dynamics in the two mammalian lineages. In the cat lineage, the ERV appears to have expanded primarily by retrotransposition of a single proviral progenitor that lost infectious capacity shortly after endogenization. In the bat lineage, the ERV followed a more complex path of germline invasion characterized by both retrotransposition and multiple infection events. The results also suggest that some of the bat ERVs have maintained infectious capacity for extended period of time and may be still infectious today. This study provides one of the most rigorously documented cases of cross-ordinal transmission of a mammalian retrovirus. It also illustrates how the same retrovirus species has transitioned multiple times from an infectious pathogen to a genomic parasite (i.e. retrotransposon), yet experiencing different invasion dynamics in different mammalian hosts."
10.1101/023937,"We propose a coalescent model for three species that allows gene flow between both pairs of sister populations. The model is designed to analyze multilocus genomic sequence alignments, with one sequence sampled from each of the three species. The model is formulated using a Markov chain representation, which allows use of matrix exponentiation to compute analytical expressions for the probability density of gene tree genealogies. The gene tree history distribution as well as the gene tree topology distribution under this coalescent model with gene flow are then calculated via numerical integration. We analyze the model to compare the distributions of gene tree topologies and gene tree histories for species trees with differing effective population sizes and gene flow rates. Our results suggest conditions under which the species tree and associated parameters are not identifiable from the gene tree topology distribution when gene flow is present, but indicate that the gene tree history distribution may identify the species tree and associated parameters. Thus, the gene tree history distribution can be used to infer parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the rates of gene flow in a maximum likelihood (ML) framework. We conduct computer simulations to evaluate the performance of our method in estimating these parameters, and we apply our method to an Afrotropical mosquito data set (Fontaine et al., 2015) to demonstrate the usefulness of our method for the analysis of empirical data."
10.1101/024240,"BackgroundThe ATP6V1B2 gene plays a critical role in the auditory system, and a mutation in this gene is one genetic cause of DDOD syndrome (Dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome, MIM 124480) and ZLS (Zimmermann-Laband syndrome, MIM 135500). However, whether and how ATP6V1B2 is involved in the development of other organs remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the effect of atp6v1b2 knockdown on early zebrafish development and verified that this gene plays a role in syndromic hearing loss.\n\nMethodsThree morpholinos (two splice-blocking, one translation-blocking) and the atp6v1b2 c.1516 C>T plasmid were used to knockdown or overexpress atp6v1b2 in zebrafish after microinjection of fertilised embryos. Control and atp6v1b2 embryo morphants were evaluated 6 days post-fertilisation in terms of motility, apoptosis, pectoral fin development, and hair cell number.\n\nResultsAtp6v1b2-knockdown zebrafish exhibited decreased body length, pericardial oedema, hair cell loss, a non-inflated swim bladder, and shorter pectoral fins; the first three phenotypes were also evident in fish overexpressing the gene.\n\nConclusionsAtp6v1b2 plays important roles in the development of hearing, the pectoral fin, the cardiovascular system, and the swim bladder, thereby supporting a role for this gene in syndromic hearing loss."
10.1101/024273,"Recent discoveries of endogenous human stem cell-associated retroviruses (SCARs) revealed consistent activation of specific endogenous retroviral elements in human preimplantation embryos and documented the essential role of the sustained retroviral activities in the maintenance of pluripotency, functional identity and integrity of naive-state embryonic stem cells, and anti-viral resistance of the early-stage human embryos. SCARs activity have been implicated in seeding thousands human-specific regulatory sequences in the hESC genome. Activation of specific SCARs, namely LTR7/HERVH and LTR5_Hs/HERVK, has been demonstrated in patients diagnosed with multiple types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and it is likely associated with the emergence of clinically lethal therapy resistant death-from-cancer phenotypes in a sub-set of cancer patients diagnosed with different types of malignant tumors."
10.1101/024356,"The lack of a comprehensive map of transcription start sites (TSS) across the highly AT-rich genome of P. falciparum has hindered progress towards deciphering the molecular mechanisms that underly the timely regulation of gene expression in this malaria parasite. Using high-throughput sequencing technologies, we generated a comprehensive atlas of transcription initiation events at single nucleotide-resolution during the parasite intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle. This detailed analysis of TSS usage enabled us to define architectural features of plasmodial promoters. We demonstrate that TSS selection and strength are constrained by local nucleotide composition. Furthermore, we provide evidence for coordinate and stage-specific TSS usage from distinct sites within the same transcriptional unit, thereby producing transcript isoforms, a subset of which are developmentally regulated. This work offers a framework for further investigations into the interactions between genomic sequences and regulatory factors governing the complex transcriptional program of this major human pathogen."
10.1101/024307,"Novel developmental programs often evolve via cooption of existing genetic networks. To understand this process, we explored cooption of the TAS3 tasiRNA pathway in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We find an ancestral function for this repeatedly redeployed pathway in the spatial regulation of a conserved set of Auxin Response Factors. In moss, this results in stochastic patterning of the filamentous protonemal tissue. Through modeling and experimentation, we demonstrate that tasiRNA regulation confers sensitivity and robustness onto the auxin response. Increased auxin sensitivity parallels increased developmental sensitivity to nitrogen, a key environmental signal. We propose that the properties lent to the auxin response network, along with the ability to stochastically modulate development in response to environmental cues, have contributed to the tasiRNA-ARF modules repeated cooption during evolution. The signaling properties of a genetic network, and not just its developmental output, are thus critical to understanding the evolution of multicellular forms."
10.1101/023770,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical energy currency of biology, is synthesized in eukaryotic cells primarily by the mitochondrial ATP synthase. ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted Fo region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F1 region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the Fo region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c8-ring within the Fo region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation driven rotation in ATP synthases."
10.1101/024315,"Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of biodiversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predicting community dynamics and stability. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence, which is a prerequisite for them to interact. Second, morphological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Moreover, inferring functioning from a network of interactions may require the incorporation of interaction efficiency. This efficiency may be also trait-mediated, and can depend on the extent of matching, or on morphological, physiological or behavioural traits. It has been shown that both neutral and trait-based models can predict the general structure of networks, but they rarely accurately predict individual interactions, suggesting that these models may be predicting the right structure for the wrong reason. We propose to move away from testing null models with a framework that explicitly models the probability of interaction among individuals given their traits. The proposed models integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from under-sampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data, and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies to show that they can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator-prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore-plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant-pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process, i.e. in determining interaction establishment, frequency, and efficiency, can we advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences for ecosystem functioning."
10.1101/024331,"Damage to the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) can lead to diseases for which there are no clearly effective treatments. Since mitochondrial function and biogenesis are controlled by the nutrient environment of the cell, it is possible that perturbation of conserved, nutrient-sensing pathways may successfully treat mitochondrial disease. We found that restricting glucose or otherwise reducing the activity of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway can lead to improved proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking mtDNA and that the transcriptional response to mtDNA loss is reduced in cells with diminished PKA activity. We have excluded many pathways and proteins from being individually responsible for the benefits provided to cells lacking mtDNA by PKA inhibition, and we found that robust import of mitochondrial polytopic membrane proteins may be required in order for cells without mtDNA to receive the full benefits of PKA reduction. Finally, we have discovered that the transcription of genes involved in arginine biosynthesis and aromatic amino acid catabolism is altered after mtDNA damage. Our results highlight the potential importance of nutrient detection and availability on the outcome of mitochondrial dysfunction."
10.1101/024349,"Translation initiation is a critical early step in the replication cycle of the positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Norovirus RNA, which has neither a 5' m7G cap nor an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), adopts an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis that relies on interactions between the VPg protein covalently attached to the 5'-end of the viral RNA and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell.\n\nFor murine norovirus (MNV) we previously showed that VPg binds to the middle fragment of eIF4G (4GM; residues 652-1132). Here we have used pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to demonstrate that a stretch of [~]20 amino acids at the C terminus of MNV VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. Our analysis further reveals that the MNV C-terminus binds to eIF4G HEAT-1 via a motif that is conserved in all known noroviruses. Fine mutagenic mapping suggests that the MNV VPg C terminus may interact with eIF4G in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the VPg binding site on eIF4G HEAT-1, which was confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. We have found that this site is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G HEAT-1 by demonstrating that norovirus VPg can form ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes. The functional significance of the VPg-eIF4G interaction was shown by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation. These observations define important structural details of a functional interaction between norovirus VPg and eIF4G and reveal a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy."
10.1101/024364,"Primary sensory neurons form the interface between world and brain. Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neuronsof awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by kinematics but well-predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are discrepant with previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of the sense organs."
10.1101/024323,"BackgroundSecond and third generation sequencing technologies have revolutionised bacterial genomics. Short-read Illumina reads result in cheap but fragmented assemblies, whereas longer reads are more expensive but result in more complete genomes. The Oxford Nanopore MinION device is a revolutionary mobile sequencer that can produce thousands of long, single molecule reads.\n\nResultsWe sequenced Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 using both the Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. We were able to assemble a single chromosome of 5.18 Mb, with no gaps, using publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. We identified gene rearrangements and the state of invertible promoters in the strain.\n\nConclusionsThe single chromosome assembly of Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 was achieved using only modest amounts of data, publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. This combination of technologies offers the possibility of ultra-cheap, high quality, finished bacterial genomes."
10.1101/024414,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are widely used, isolated from a variety of tissues and increasingly adopted for cell therapy, but the identity of these cells is poorly defined and commonalities between MSC from different tissues sources is controversial. Here we undertook a comprehensive review of all public MSC expression studies to assess whether cells derived from different sources shared any common molecular attributes. In doing so, we discovered an over-arching transcriptional phenotype shared by a wide variety of MSC, freshly isolated or cultured cells, and under a variety of growth conditions. We developed a modified variable selection protocol that included cross platform normalisation, and assessment of the selected gene stability and informativeness. A 16-gene signature classified MSC with >97% accuracy, discriminating these from fibroblasts, other adult stem/progenitor cell types and differentiated cells. The genes form part of a protein-interaction network, and mutations in more than 65% of this network were associated with Mendelian disorders of skeletal growth or metabolism. The signature and accompanying datasets are provided as a community resource at www.stemformatics.org resource, and the method is available from the CRAN repository."
10.1101/024448,"BackgroundAs the sheer volume of bioinformatic sequence data increases, the only way to take advantage of this content is to more completely automate robust analysis workflows. Analysis bottlenecks are often mundane and overlooked processing steps. Idiosyncrasies in reading and/or writing bioinformatics file formats can halt or impair analysis workflows by interfering with the transfer of data from one informatics tools to another.\n\nResultsFasta-O-Matic automates handling of common but minor format issues that otherwise may halt pipelines. The need for automation must be balanced by the need for manual confirmation that any formatting error is actually minor rather than indicative of a corrupt data file. To that end Fasta-O-Matic reports any issues detected to the user with optionally color coded and quiet or verbose logs.\n\nFasta-O-Matic can be used as a general pre-processing tool in bioinformatics workflows (e.g. to automatically wrap FASTA files so that they can be read by BioPerl). It was also developed as a sanity check for bioinformatic core facilities that tend to repeat common analysis steps on FASTA files received from disparate sources. Fasta-O-Matic can be set with format requirements specific to downstream tools as a first step in a larger analysis workflow.\n\nAvailabilityFasta-O-Matic is available free of charge to academic and non-profit institutions on GitHub."
10.1101/024513,"One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in humans. Accumulated evidences suggest that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. Here we address this unmet need by integrating energetic and conformational dynamic features derived from molecular modeling with multi-task learning. To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. Our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We find that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics between protein and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relative movement of normal nodes of amino acids upon ligand binding is an important feature to capture conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the multi-task learning, we can predict combined kon and koff accurately with an accuracy of 74.35%. Thus, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links in drug discovery."
10.1101/024430,"Network-based analysis methods can help resolve coverage and inconsistency issues in proteomics data. Previously, it was demonstrated that a suite of rank-based network approaches (RBNAs) provides unparalleled consistency and reliable feature selection. However, reliance on the t-statistic/t-distribution and hypersensitivity (coupled to a relatively flat p-value distribution) makes feature prioritization for validation difficult. To address these concerns, a refinement based on the fuzzified Fisher exact test, Fuzzy-FishNet was developed. Fuzzy-FishNet is highly precise (providing probability values that allows exact ranking of features). Furthermore, feature ranks are stable, even in small sample size scenario. Comparison of features selected by genomics and proteomics data respectively revealed that in spite of relative feature stability, cross-platform overlaps are extremely limited, suggesting that networks may not be the answer towards bridging the proteomics-genomics divide."
10.1101/024562,"The oxygen status of a tumor has significant clinical implications for treatment prognosis, with well-oxygenated subvolumes responding markedly better to radiotherapy than poorly supplied regions. Oxygen is essential for tumor growth, yet estimation of local oxygen distribution can be difficult to ascertain in situ, due to chaotic patterns of vasculature. It is possible to avoid this confounding influence by using avascular tumor models, such as tumor spheroids, a much better approximation of realistic tumor dynamics than monolayers, where oxygen supply can be described by diffusion alone. Similar to in situ tumours, spheroids exhibit an approximately sigmoidal growth curve, often approximated and fitted by logistic and Gompertzian sigmoid functions. These describe the basic rate of growth well, but do not offer an explicitly mechanistic explanation. This work examines the oxygen dynamics of spheroids and demonstrates that this growth can be derived mechanistically with cellular doubling time and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) being key parameters. The model is fitted to growth curves for a range of cell lines and derived values of OCR are validated using clinical measurement. Finally, we illustrate how changes in OCR due to gemcitabine treatment can be directly inferred using this model."
10.1101/024497,"Tomasetti and Vogelstein (Science 347, 78-81, 2015) claimed that \""primary prevention measures are not likely to be very effective\"" for many cancers because they arise mostly from random mutations fixed during stem cell division, independently of specific genetic or environmental factors. We demonstrate that their calculation for hepatocellular carcinomas overlooked a major subset of tumors proven to be preventable through vaccination. The problem, which is not limited to hepatocellular carcinoma, arises from the general reliance of their analysis on average USA incidences and the omission of incidences in specific risk groups."
10.1101/024208,"In Drosophila embryogenesis, increasing either oxygen concentration or temperature accelerates development. Having previously investigated temperatures impact on embryogenesis, we characterized developmental response to oxygen levels using time-lapse imaging. Changing oxygen concentrations greatly impact survival, with developmental rate changes that are dwarfed by those induced by temperature. While extreme temperatures increase early embryo mortality, mild hypoxia increases arrest and death during mid-embryogenesis and mild hyperoxia increases survival over normoxia. Though not independent, the reactions to temperature and oxygen are fundamentally different, with developmental time being inversely proportional to oxygen concentration but logarithmically related to temperature. Most notably, while development scales uniformly with temperature, oxygen changes drive developmental heterochrony. Morphological processes change with oxygen concentration at different rates. Gut formation is more severely slowed by decreases in oxygen, while head involution and syncytial development are less impacted than the rest of development. These data reveal that uniform scaling, seen with changes in temperature, is not the default result of adjusting developmental rate."
10.1101/024547,"Detecting the targets of adaptive natural selection from whole genome sequencing data is a central problem for population genetics. However, to date most methods have shown sub-optimal performance under realistic demographic scenarios. Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/HIC, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/HIC has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover we show that S/HIC is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/HIC still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally we apply S/HIC to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods."
10.1101/024596,"The oomycete Phytophthora infestans was the causal agent of the Irish Great Famine and is a recurring threat to global food security1. The pathogen can reproduce both sexually and asexually and has a potential to adapt both abiotic and biotic environment2. Although in many regions the A1 and A2 mating types coexist, the far majority of isolates belong to few clonal, asexual lineages3. As other oomycetes, P. infestans is thought to be diploid during the vegetative phase of its life cycle3, but it was observed that trisomy correlated with virulence and mating type locus4 and that polyploidy can occur in some isolates5,6. It remains unknown about the frequency of polyploidy occurrence in nature and the relationship between ploidy level and sexuality. Here we discovered that the sexuality of P. infestans isolates correlates with ploidy by comparison of microsatellite fingerprinting, genome-wide polymorphism, DNA quantity, and chromosome numbers. The sexual progeny of P. infestans in nature are diploid, whereas the asexual lineages are mostly triploids, including successful clonal lineages US-1 and 13_A2. This study reveals polyploidization as an extra evolutionary risk to this notorious plant destroyer."
10.1101/024471,"Developmental gene networks implement the dynamic regulatory mechanisms that pattern and shape the organism. Over evolutionary time, the wiring of these networks changes, yet the patterning outcome is often preserved, a phenomenon known as \""system drift\"". System drift is illustrated by the gap gene network--involved in segmental patterning--in dipteran insects. In the classic model organism Drosophila melanogaster and the non-model scuttle fly Megaselia abdita, early activation and placement of gap gene expression domains show significant quantitative differences, yet the final patterning output of the system is essentially identical in both species. In this detailed modeling analysis of system drift, we use gene circuits which are fit to quantitative gap gene expression data in M. abdita and compare them to an equivalent set of models from D. melanogaster. The results of this comparative analysis show precisely how compensatory regulatory mechanisms achieve equivalent final patterns in both species. We discuss the larger implications of the work in terms of \""genotype networks\"" and the ways in which the structure of regulatory networks can influence patterns of evolutionary change (evolvability)."
10.1101/024554,"The Kets, an ethnic group in the Yenisei River basin, Russia, are considered the last nomadic hunter-gatherers of Siberia, and Ket language has no transparent affiliation with any language family. We investigated connections between the Kets and Siberian and North American populations, with emphasis on the Malta and Paleo-Eskimo ancient genomes, using original data from 46 unrelated samples of Kets and 42 samples of their neighboring ethnic groups (Uralic-speaking Nganasans, Enets, and Selkups). We genotyped over 130,000 autosomal SNPs, identified mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal haplogroups, and performed high-coverage genome sequencing of two Ket individuals. We established that Nganasans, Kets, Selkups, and Yukaghirs form a cluster of populations most closely related to Paleo-Eskimos in Siberia (not considering indigenous populations of Chukotka and Kamchatka). Kets are closely related to modern Selkups and to some Bronze and Iron Age populations of the Altai region, with all these groups sharing a high degree of Malta ancestry. Implications of these findings for the linguistic hypothesis uniting Ket and Na-Dene languages into a language macrofamily are discussed."
10.1101/024570,"Errors segregating homologous chromosomes during meiosis result in the formation of aneuploid gametes and are the largest contributing factor to birth defects and spontaneous abortions in humans. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long served as a model organism for studying the gene network supporting normal chromosome segregation. Current methods of measuring homolog nondisjunction frequencies are laborious and involve dissecting thousands of tetrads to detect missegregation of individually marked chromosomes. Here we describe a holistic computational approach to determine the relative contributions of meiosis I nondisjunction and random spore death in mutants with reduced spore viability. These values are based on best-fit distributions of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 viable-spore tetrads to observed distributions in mutant and wild-type strains. We show proof-of-principle using published data sets that the calculated average meiosis I nondisjunction frequency closely matches empirically determined values. This analysis also points to meiosis I nondisjunction as an intrinsic component of spore inviability in wild-type strains. We uncover two classes of mutants that show distinct relationships between nondisjunction death and random spore death. Class I mutants, including those with known defects in establishing and maintaining the physical engagement of homologous chromosomes display a 4-fold greater ratio of nondisjunction death to random spore death compared to Class II mutants, which include those with defects in sister chromatid cohesion. Low numbers of required tetrads facilitates epistasis analysis to probe genetic interactions. Finally the application of the R-Scripts does not require any special strain construction and can be applied to previously observed tetrad distributions."
10.1101/024588,"Genetic differences in gene expression contribute significantly to phenotypic diversity and differences in disease susceptibility. In fact, the great majority of causal variants highlighted by genome-wide association are in non-coding regions that modulate expression. In order to quantify the extent of allelic differences in expression, we analyzed liver transcriptomes of isogenic F1 hybrid mice. Allele-specific expression (ASE) effects are pervasive and are detected in over 50% of assayed genes. Genes with strong ASE do not differ from those with no ASE with respect to their length or promoter complexity. However, they have a higher density of sequence variants, higher functional redundancy, and lower evolutionary conservation compared to genes with no ASE. Fifty percent of genes with no ASE are categorized as house-keeping genes. In contrast, the high ASE set may be critical in phenotype canalization. There is significant overlap between genes that exhibit ASE and those that exhibit strong cis expression quantitative trait loci (cis eQTLs) identified using large genetic expression data sets. Eighty percent of genes with cis eQTLs also have strong ASE effects. Conversely, 40% of genes with ASE effects are associated with strong cis eQTLs. Cis-acting variation detected at the protein level is also detected at the transcript level, but the converse is not true. ASE is a highly sensitive and direct method to quantify cis-acting variation in gene expression and complements and extends classic cis eQTL analysis. ASE differences can be combined with coding variants to produce a key resource of functional variants for precision medicine and genome-to-phenome mapping."
10.1101/024455,"Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare, often lethal cause of encephalitis, for which early diagnosis and prompt initiation of combination antimicrobials may improve clinical outcomes. In this study, we present the first draft assembly of the Balamuthia mandrillaris genome recovered from a rare survivor of PAM, in total comprising 49 Mb of sequence. Comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome and high-copy number genes from 6 additional Balamuthia mandrillaris strains demonstrated remarkable sequence variation, with the closest homologs corresponding to other amoebae, hydroids, algae, slime molds, and peat moss. We also describe the use of unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) and SURPI bioinformatics analysis to diagnose an ultimately fatal case of Balamuthia mandrillaris encephalitis in a 15-year old girl. Real-time NGS testing of a hospital day 6 CSF sample detected Balamuthia on the basis of high-quality hits to 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA sequences present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nt reference database. Retrospective analysis of a day 1 CSF sample revealed that more timely identification of Balamuthia by metagenomic NGS, potentially resulting in a better outcome, would have required availability of the complete genome sequence. These results underscore the diverse evolutionary origins underpinning this eukaryotic pathogen, and the critical importance of whole-genome reference sequences for microbial detection by NGS."
10.1101/024463,"The first introns in eukaryotes are much longer than downstream introns. While the functional roles of large first introns have been studied extensively, investigations into the mechanisms leading up to extreme lengths are limited. Prominently, Hong et al. noted that the first introns are predominantly in 5 UTR and suggested that its lengthening may have resulted from a 5-ward shifting of donor site due to a lower selection on splice site, as well as a selection to occlude upstream cryptic translation start sites. Here we suggest exon skipping as an alternative mechanism for first intron lengthening. Exon skipping results in consecutive introns becoming part of a single longer intron. We reasoned that a 5-biased exon skipping rate could lead to longer introns toward the 5-end of the gene, especially the first intron. Based on multiple datasets in human and mouse, we indeed found that internal exons toward the 5-end of the gene are skipped significantly more frequently than the downstream exons. Importantly, we show that 5-biased exon skipping is supported by consistent 5-bias in several genomic, epigenomic, contextual, and evolutionary features that can be functionally linked to exon skipping. Interestingly, we found that first introns are enriched for relics of, now defunct, exons, some of which may have been recruited for regulatory functions; a significantly greater-than-expected fraction of such exons are included in cDNAs in other mammals. Overall, our results offer 5-biased exon skipping as a novel, and arguably more potent, alternative explanation for substantially lengthening of first introns."

Using clusters of spatially proximal enhancers, or archipelagos, and DNase footprints to quantify TF occupancy, we report for the first time an emergent group-level effect on occupancy, whereby BS within an archipelago experience greater in vivo occupancy than comparable BS outside archipelagos, i.e. BS not in spatial proximity with other homotypic BS. This occupancy boost is tissue-specific and scales robustly with the total number of BS, or enhancers, for the TF in the archipelago. Interestingly, enhancers within an archipelago are non-uniformly impacted by the occupancy boost; specifically, archipelago enhancers that are enriched for BS corresponding to degenerate motifs exhibit the greatest occupancy boost, as well as the highest overall accessibility, evolutionary selection, and expression at neighboring gene loci. Strikingly, archipelago-wide activity scales with expression of TFs with degenerate, but not specific, motifs. We explain these results through biophysical modelling, which suggests that spatially proximal homotypic BS facilitate TF diffusion, and induce boosts in local TF concentration and occupancy. Together, we demonstrate for the first time cooperativity among genomically distal homotypic BS that is contingent upon their spatial proximity, consistent with a TF diffusion model. Through leveraging of three-dimensional chromatin structure and TF availability, weak archipelago binding sites crowdsource their occupancy as well as context specificity, with coordinated switch-like effect on overall archipelago activity."
10.1101/024406,"In the adult mammalian cortex, a small fraction of spines are created and eliminated every day, and the resultant synaptic connection structure is highly nonrandom, even in local circuits. However, it remains unknown whether a particular synaptic connection structure is functionally advantageous in local circuits, and why creation and elimination of synaptic connections is necessary in addition to rich synaptic weight plasticity. To answer these questions, we studied an inference task model through theoretical and numerical analyses. We demonstrate that a robustly beneficial network structure naturally emerges by combining Hebbian-type synaptic weight plasticity and wiring plasticity. Especially in a sparsely connected network, wiring plasticity achieves reliable computation by enabling efficient information transmission. Furthermore, the proposed rule reproduces experimental observed correlation between spine dynamics and task performance."

This is a serious impediment for both the sharing of data across labs, as well as the utilization of modern and high-performance computing capabilities to enable data driven discovery. Here, we introduce BRAINformat, a novel file format and model for management and storage of neuroscience data. The BRAINformat library defines application-independent design concepts and modules that together create a general framework for standardization of scientific data.\n\nWe describe the formal specification of scientific data standards, which facilitates sharing and verification of data and formats. We introduce the concept of Managed Objects, enabling semantic components of data formats to be specified as self-contained units, supporting modular and reusable design of data format components and file storage. The BRAINformat is built off of HDF5, enabling portable, scalable, and self-describing data storage. We introduce the novel concept of Relationship Attributes for modeling and use of semantic relationships between data objects, and discuss the annotation of data using dedicated data annotation modules provided by the BRAINformat library. Based on these concepts we implement dedicated, application-oriented modules and design a data standard for neuroscience data.

10.1101/024299,"Yeast-based biosynthesis of medicinal compounds traditionally derived from plant materials is improving. Both concerns and hopes exist for the possibility that individual small volume batch fermentations could provide distributed and independent access to a diversity of compounds some of which are now abused, illegal, or unavailable to many who need for genuine medical purposes. However, there are differences between industrial bioreactors and  home-brew fermentation. We used engineered yeast that make thebaine, a morphinan opiate, to quantify if differences in fermentation conditions impact biosynthesis yields. We used yeast that make an English ale as a positive fermentation control. We observed no production of thebaine and miniscule amounts of reticuline, an upstream biosynthetic intermediate, in home-brew fermentations; the positive control was palatable. We suggest that additional technical challenges, some of which are unknown and likely unrelated to optimized production in large-volume bioreactors, would need to be addressed for engineered yeast to ever realize home-brew biosynthesis of medicinal opiates at meaningful yields."
10.1101/024604,"Cell-free environments are becoming viable alternatives for implementing biological networks in synthetic biology. The reconstituted cell-free expression system (PURE) allows characterization of genetic networks under defined conditions but its applicability to native bacterial promoters and endogenous genetic networks is limited due to the poor transcription rate of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in this minimal system. We found that addition of transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB to the PURE system increased transcription rates of E. coli RNA polymerase from sigma factor 70 promoters up to 6-fold and enhanced the performance of a genetic network. Furthermore, we reconstituted activation of natural E. coli promoters controlling flagella biosynthesis by the transcriptional activator FlhDC and sigma factor 28. Addition of GreA/GreB to the PURE system allows efficient expression from natural and synthetic E. coli promoters and characterization of their regulation in minimal and defined reaction conditions making the PURE system more broadly applicable to study genetic networks and bottom-up synthetic biology.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/024604_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@53902org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1ba85org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c961eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143928d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG"
10.1101/024612,"The diversity of a persons B- and T-cell repertoires is both clinically important and a key measure of immunological complexity. However, diversity is hard to estimate by current methods, due to inherent uncertainty in the number of B- and T-cell clones that will be missing from a blood or tissue sample by chance (the missing-species problem), inevitable sampling bias, and experimental noise. To solve this problem we developed Recon, a modified maximum-likelihood method that outputs the overall diversity of a repertoire from measurements on a sample. Recon outputs accurate, robust estimates by any of a vast set of complementary diversity measures, including species richness and entropy, at fractional repertoire coverage. It also outputs error bars and power tables, allowing robust comparisons of diversity between individuals and over time. We apply Recon to in silico and experimental immune-repertoire sequencing datasets as proof of principle for measuring diversity in large, complex systems."
10.1101/024653,"Dopaminergic (DA) neurons display two modes of firing: low-frequency tonic and high-frequency bursts. The high frequency firing within the bursts is attributed to NMDA, but not AMPA receptor activation. In our models of the DA neuron, both biophysical and abstract, the NMDA receptor current can significantly increase their firing frequency, whereas the AMPA receptor current is not able to evoke high-frequency activity and usually suppresses firing. However, both currents are produced by glutamate receptors and, consequently, are often co-activated. Here we consider combined influence of AMPA and NMDA synaptic input in the models of the DA neuron. Different types of neuronal activity (resting state, low frequency, or high frequency firing) are observed depending on the conductance of the AMPAR and NMDAR currents. In two models, biophysical and reduced, we show that the firing frequency increases more effectively if both receptors are co-activated for certain parameter values. In particular, in the more quantitative biophysical model, the maximal frequency is 40% greater than that with NMDAR alone. The dynamical mechanism of such frequency growth is explained in the framework of phase space evolution using the reduced model. In short, both the AMPAR and NMDAR currents flatten the voltage nullcline, providing the frequency increase, whereas only NMDA prevents complete unfolding of the nullcline, providing robust firing. Thus, we confirm a major role of the NMDAR in generating high-frequency firing and conclude that AMPAR activation further significantly increases the frequency."

Mindfulness basically refers to moment to moment awareness. In this review we summarize different hypotheses concerning effects of mindfulness meditation practice and cerebral correlates accounting for these; furthermore we expose some of the most relevant theories dealing with different aspects of consciousness. Finally we propose an integration of mindfulness meditation with consciousness, supported by the identification of brain areas involved in both of them, namely Anterior Cingular Cortex (ACC), Posterior Cingular Cortex (PCC), Insula and Thalamus."
10.1101/024703,"Bacteria that are subjected to ribosome inhibiting antibiotic drugs show an interesting behavior: Although the drug slows down cell growth, it also paradoxically increases the cells concentration of ribosomes. We combine a prior nonlinear model of the energy-biomass balance in undrugged E. coli cells (Maitra and Dill, PNAS 2015) with Michaelis-Menten binding of drugs that inactivate ribosomes. Predictions are in good agreement with experiments on ribosomal concentrations and synthesis rates vs. drug concentrations and growth rates. The model indicates that added drug drives the cell to overproduce ribosomes keeping roughly constant the level of ribosomes producing ribosomal proteins, an important quantity for cell growth. The model also predicts that ribosomal production rates should increase, then decrease with added drug. This model gives insights into cellular driving forces and suggests new experiments."
10.1101/024661,"A well-known DNA-damaging agent and carcinogen, ionizing radiation (IR) can also exert detrimental effects in cells not directly exposed to it, through \""non-targeted effects\"" (NTE). Whilst NTE are known to contribute to radiation-induced damage, their mechanism of induction and propagation remains incompletely understood. To investigate the possible role of lysosomes, key subcellular organelles, in NTE we used acridine orange uptake and relocation methods to monitor lysosomal permeability in irradiated and bystander human fibroblasts. As a potential mediator of lysosomal changes, oxidative stress was measured using the H2DCFDA assay for total reactive oxygen species (ROS). IR was found to induce significant lysosomal permeability in the first hour post irradiation, with reduced permeability persisting up to 24 hours. This occurred in conjunction with an increase in ROS in directly irradiated cells, in contrast with a decrease in ROS in bystander cells. Based on these observations we constructed a simple mathematical model of ROS-induced lysosomal damage, based on a bistable mechanism where a sufficiently strong IR insult can shift a cell from a  low ROS, high lysosome to a  high ROS, low lysosome state. This has profound cellular implications in radiation response and advances our understanding for the sub-cellular involvement in non-targeted effects."
10.1101/024711,"During speciation, sex chromosomes often accumulate interspecific genetic incompatibilities faster than the rest of the genome. The drive theory posits that sex chromosomes are susceptible to recurrent bouts of meiotic drive and suppression, causing the evolutionary build-up of divergent cryptic sex-linked drive systems and, incidentally, genetic incompatibilities. To assess the role of drive during speciation, we combine high-resolution genetic mapping of X-linked hybrid male sterility with population genomics analyses of divergence and recent gene flow between the fruitfly species, Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans. Our findings reveal a high density of genetic incompatibilities and a corresponding dearth of gene flow on the X chromosome. Surprisingly, we find that, rather than contributing to interspecific divergence, a known drive element has recently migrated between species, caused a strong reduction in local divergence, and undermined the evolution of hybrid sterility. Gene flow can therefore mediate the effects of selfish genetic elements during speciation."
10.1101/024620,"Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) are fundamental structural and functional building blocks of human interphase chromosomes, yet mechanisms of TAD formation remain unknown. Here we propose that loop extrusion underlies TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins, form progressively larger loops, but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that this model can produce TADs as determined by our analyses of Hi-C data. Contrary to typical illustrations, each TAD consists of multiple dynamically formed loops, rather than a single static loop. Our model explains diverse experimental observations, including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments, and makes specific predictions for depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. The emerging picture is that TADs arise from actively forming, growing, and dissociating loops, presenting a framework for understanding interphase chromosomal organization."
10.1101/024646,"BackgroundThe implantation of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in heart failure patients is associated with a systemic inflammatory response, potentially leading to death from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Previous studies point to the involvement of many mechanisms, but an integrative hypothesis does not yet exist. Using time-dependent whole-genome mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes, we constructed a systems-model to improve mechanistic understanding and prediction of adverse outcomes.\n\nMethodsWe sampled peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 consecutive patients undergoing MCS surgery, at 5 timepoints: day -1 preoperative, and days 1, 3, 5, and 8 postoperative. Phenotyping was performed using 12 clinical parameters, 2 organ dysfunction scoring systems, and survival outcomes. We constructed a systems-representation using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and annotated eigengenes using gene ontology, pathway, and transcription factor binding site enrichment analyses. Genes and eigengenes were mapped to the clinical phenotype using a linear mixed-effect model, with Cox models also fit at each timepoint to survival outcomes. Finally, we selected top genes associated with survival across all timepoints, and trained a penalized Cox model, based on day -1 data, to predict mortality risk thereafter.\n\nResultsWe inferred a 19-module network, in which most module eigengenes correlated with at least one aspect of the clinical phenotype. We observed a response to surgery orchestrated into stages: first, activation of the innate immune response, followed by anti-inflammation, and finally reparative processes such as mitosis, coagulation, and apoptosis. Eigengenes related to red blood cell production and extracellular matrix degradation became predictors of survival late in the timecourse, consistent with organ failure due to disseminated coagulopathy. Our final predictive model consisted of 10 genes: IL2RA, HSPA7, AFAP1, SYNJ2, LOC653406, GAPDHP35, MGC12916, ZRSR2, and two currently unidentified genes, warranting further investigation.\n\nConclusionOur model provides an integrative representation of leukocyte biology during the systemic inflammatory response following MCS device implantation. It demonstrates consistency with previous hypotheses, identifying a number of known mechanisms. At the same time, it suggests novel hypotheses about time-specific targets."

10.1101/024737,"The coalescent process is an important and widely used model for inferring the dynamics of biological populations from samples of genetic diversity. Coalescent analysis typically involves applying statistical methods to either samples of genetic sequences or an estimated genealogy in order to estimate the demographic history of the population from which the samples originated. Several parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques, employing diverse methods, such as Gaussian processes and Monte Carlo particle filtering, already exist. However, these techniques often trade estimation accuracy and sophistication for methodological flexibility and ease of use. Thus, there is room for new coalescent estimation techniques that can be easily implemented for a range of inference problems while still maintaining some sense of statistical optimality.\n\nHere we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter as a natural, easily implementable and flexible minimum mean square error estimator for parametric demographic functions. By reinterpreting the coalescent as a self-correcting inhomogeneous Poisson process, we show that the Snyder filter can be applied to both isochronous (sampled at one time point) and heterochronous (serially sampled) estimation problems. We test the estimation performance of the filter on both standard, simulated demographic models and on a well-studied empirical dataset comprising hepatitis= C virus sequences from Egypt. Additionally, we provide some analytical insight into the relationship between the Snyder filter and popular maximum likelihood and skyline plot techniques for coalescent inference. The Snyder filter is an exact and direct Bayesian estimation method that provides optimal mean square error estimates. It has the potential to become as a useful, alternative technique for coalescent inference."
10.1101/024745,"Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (long QT syndrome, LQTS) can lead to a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia called torsades de pointes (TdP). 180 drugs with both cardiac and non-cardiac indications have been found to increase risk for TdP, but drug-drug interactions contributing to LQTS (QT-DDIs) remain poorly characterized. Traditional methods for mining observational healthcare data are poorly equipped to detect QT- DDI signals due to low reporting numbers and a lack of direct evidence for LQTS. In this study we present an integrative data science pipeline that addresses these limitations by identifying latent signals for QT-DDIs in the FDAs Adverse Event Reporting System and retrospectively validating these predictions using electrocardiogram data in electronic health records. We present 26 novel QT-DDIs flagged using this method that warrant further investigation.\n\nKey Points- Drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) can lead to potentially fatal arrhythmias (torsades de pointes, TdP). Drug-drug interactions that prolong the QT interval (QT- DDIs) can be clinically significant but remain poorly characterized.\n- Observational health data (such as adverse event spontaneous reporting systems and electronic health records) offer an opportunity to mine for new QT-DDIs, but when used individually these datasets have a number of limitations that prevent identification of true signals.\n- We present an integrative data science approach that combines mining for latent QT- DDI signals in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and retrospective analysis of electrocardiogram lab results in electronic health records at Columbia University Medical Center to identify 26 novel QT-DDIs."
10.1101/024778,"Coccidioidomycosis (or Valley Fever) is a fungal disease with high morbidity and mortality that affects tens of thousands of people each year. This infection is caused by two sibling species, Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, which are endemic to specific arid locales throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly the desert southwest of the United States. Recent epidemiological and population genetic data suggest that the geographic range of coccidioidomycosis is expanding as new endemic clusters have been identified in the state of Washington, well outside of the established endemic range. The genetic mechanisms and epidemiological consequences of this expansion are unknown and require better understanding of the population structure and evolutionary history of these pathogens. Here we perform multiple phylogenetic inference and population genomics analyses of 68 new and 18 previously published genomes. The results provide evidence of substantial population structure in C. posadasii and demonstrate presence of distinct geographic clades in central and southern Arizona as well as dispersed populations in Texas, Mexico, South America and Central America. Although a smaller number of C. immitis strains were included in the analyses, some evidence of phylogeographic structure was also detected in this species, which has been historically limited to California and Baja Mexico. Bayesian analyses indicated that C. posadasii is the more ancient of the two species and that Arizona contains the most diverse subpopulations. We propose a southern Arizona-northern Mexico origin for C. posadasii and describe a pathway for dispersal and distribution out of this region."
10.1101/024695,"Males and females share many traits that have a common genetic basis, however selection on these traits often differs between the sexes leading to sexual conflict1,2. Under such sexual antagonism, theory predicts the evolution of genetic architectures that resolve this sexual conflict2-6. Yet, despite intense theoretical and empirical interest, the specific genetic loci behind sexually antagonistic phenotypes have rarely been identified, limiting our understanding of how sexual conflict impacts genome evolution4,7,8 and the maintenance of genetic diversity8,9. Here, we identify a large effect locus controlling age at maturity in 57 salmon populations, an important fitness trait in which selection favours earlier maturation in males than females10, and show it is a clear example of sex dependent dominance reducing intralocus sexual conflict and maintaining adaptive variation in wild populations. Using high density SNP data and whole genome re-sequencing, we found that vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3) exhibits sex-dependent dominance in salmon, promoting earlier and later maturation in males and females, respectively. VGLL3, an adiposity regulator associated with size and age at maturity in humans, explained 39.4% of phenotypic variation, an unexpectedly high effect size for what is usually considered a highly polygenic trait. Such large effects are predicted under balancing selection from either sexually antagonistic or spatially varying selection11-13. Our results provide the first empirical example of dominance reversal permitting greater optimisation of phenotypes within each sex, contributing to the resolution of sexual conflict in a major and widespread evolutionary trade-off between age and size at maturity. They also provide key empirical evidence for how variation in reproductive strategies can be maintained over large geographical scales. We further anticipate these findings will have a substantial impact on population management in a range of harvested species where trends towards earlier maturation have been observed."
10.1101/024927,"BackgroundSea age at sexual maturation displays large plasticity for wild Atlantic salmon males and varies between 1-5 years. This flexibility can also be observed in domesticated salmon. Previous studies have uncovered a genetic predisposition for age at maturity with moderate heritability, thus suggesting a polygenic nature of this trait. The aim with this study was to identify genomic regions and associated SNPs and genes conferring age at maturity in salmon.\n\nResultsWe performed a GWAS using a pool sequencing approach (n=20 per river and trait) of salmon returning as sexually mature either after one sea winter (2009) or after three sea winters (2011) in six rivers in Norway. The study revealed one major selective sweep, which covered 76 significant SNP in a 230 kb region of Chr 25. A SNP assay of other year classes of wild salmon and from cultivated fish supported this finding. The assay in cultivated fish reduced the haplotype conferring the trait to a region which covered 4 SNPs of a 2386 bp region containing the vgll3 gene. 2 of these SNPs caused miss-sense mutations in vgll3.\n\nConclusionsThis study presents a single selective region in the genome for age at maturation in male Atlantic salmon. The SNPs identified may be used as QTLs to prevent early maturity in aquaculture and in monitoring programs of wild salmon. Interestingly, the identified vgll3 gene has previously been linked to time of puberty in humans, suggesting a conserved mechanism for time of puberty in vertebrates."
10.1101/024869,"Meiotic recombination breaks down linkage disequilibrium and forms new haplotypes, meaning thatit is an important driver of diversity in eukaryotic genomes. Understanding the causes of variation in recombination rate is important in interpreting and predicting evolutionary phenomena and forunderstanding the potential of a population to respond to selection. However, despite attention inmodel systems, there remains little data on how recombination rate varies at the individual level in natural populations. Here, we used extensive pedigree and high-density SNP information in a wild population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to investigate the genetic architecture of individual autosomal recombination rate. Individual rates were high relative to other mammal systems, and were higher in males than in females (autosomal map lengths of 3748 cM and 2860 cM, respectively). The heritability of autosomal recombination rate was low but significant in both sexes(h2 = 0.16 & 0.12 in females and males, respectively). In females, 46.7% of the heritable variation was explained by a sub-telomeric region on chromosome 6; a genome-wide association study showed the strongest associations at the locus RNF212, with further associations observed at a nearby ~374kb region of complete linkage disequilibrium containing three additional candidate loci, CPLX1, GAK and PCGF3. A second region on chromosome 7 containing REC8 and RNF212B explained 26.2% of the heritable variation in recombination rate in both sexes. Comparative analyses with 40 other sheep breeds showed that haplotypes associated with recombination rates are both old and globally distributed. Both regions have been implicated in rate variation in mice, cattle and humans, suggesting a common genetic architecture of recombination rate variation in mammals.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRecombination offers an escape from genetic linkage by forming new combinations of alleles, increasing the potential for populations to respond to selection. Understanding the causes and consequences of individual recombination rates are important in studies of evolution and genetic improvement, yet little is known on how rates vary in natural systems. Using data from a wild population of Soay sheep, we show that individual recombination rate is heritable and differs between the sexes, with the majority of genetic variation in females explained by a genomic region containing thegenes RNF212 and CPLX1."
10.1101/024828,"Abstract.Immune reconstitution kinetics and subsequent clinical outcomes in HLA matched recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) are variable and difficult to predict. Considering SCT as a dynamical system, may allow sequence differences across the exomes of the transplant donors and recipients to be used to simulate an alloreactive T cell response, which may allow better clinical outcome prediction. To accomplish this, whole exome sequencing was performed on 34 HLA matched SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRP), and the nucleotide sequence differences translated to peptides. The binding affinity of the peptides to the relevant HLA in each DRP was determined. The resulting array of peptide-HLA binding affinity values in each patient was considered as an operator modifying a hypothetical T cell repertoire vector, in which each T cell clone proliferates in accordance to the logistic equation of growth. Using an iterating system of matrices, each simulated T cell clones growth was calculated with the steady state population being proportional to the magnitude of the binding affinity of the driving HLA-peptide complex. Incorporating competition between T cell clones responding to different HLA-peptide complexes reproduces a number of features of clinically observed T cell clonal repertoire in the simulated repertoire. These include, sigmoidal growth kinetics of individual T cell clones and overall repertoire, Power Law clonal frequency distribution, increase in repertoire complexity over time with increasing clonal diversity and finally, alteration of clonal dominance when a different antigen array is encountered, such as in stem cell transplantation. The simulated, alloreactive T cell repertoire was markedly different in HLA matched DRP. The patterns were differentiated by rate of growth, and steady state magnitude of the simulated T cell repertoire and demonstrate a possible correlation with survival. In conclusion, exome wide sequence differences in DRP may allow simulation of donor alloreactive T cell response to recipient antigens and may provide a quantitative basis for refining donor selection and titration of immunosuppression following SCT."
10.1101/024844,"The Ten Eleven Translocation 1 (TET1) protein is a DNA demethylase that regulates gene expression through alteration of DNA methylation. Recent studies have demonstrated that TET1 could modulate transcriptional expression independent of its DNA demethylation activity; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying TET1s role in such transcriptional regulation remain not well understood. Here, we uncovered that Tet1 formed a chromatin complex with histone acetyltransferase Mof and scaffold protein Sin3a in mouse embryonic stem cells by integrative genomic analysis using publicly available ChIP-seq data sets. Specifically, the TET1/SIN3A/hMOF complex mediates acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16, via facilitating the binding of hMOF on chromatin, to regulate expression of important DNA repair genes in DNA double strand breaks, including TP53BP1, RAD50, RAD51, and BRCA1, for homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repairs. Under hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, dissociation of TET1 and hMOF from chromatin, concurrent with increased binding of SIRT1 on chromatin, led to hypo-acetylation of H4K16, reduced expression of these DNA repair genes, and DNA repair defects in a DNA methylation independent manner. A similar epigenetic dynamic alteration was also observed in H-RASV12 oncogenic-transformed cells, supporting the notion that suppression of TET1 downregulates DNA repair genes through modifying H4K16ac, instead of its demethylation function, and therefore contribute to tumorigenesis. Taken together, our results suggested a mechanistic link between a novel TET1 complex and H4K16ac, DNA repair genes expression, and genomic instability."
10.1101/024810,"AbstractSynthetic constructs in biotechnology, biocomputing, and modern gene therapy interventions are often based on plasmids or transfected circuits which implement some form of \""on-off\"" switch. For example, the expression of a protein used for therapeutic purposes might be triggered by the recognition of a specific combination of inducers (e.g., antigens), and memory of this event should be maintained across a cell population until a specific stimulus commands a coordinated shut-off. The robustness of such a design is hampered by molecular (\""intrinsic\"") or environmental (\""extrinsic\"") noise, which may lead to spontaneous changes of state in a subset of the population and is reflected in the bimodality of protein expression, as measured for example using flow cytometry. In this context, a \""majority-vote\"" correction circuit, which brings deviant cells back into the desired state, is highly desirable, and quorum-sensing has been suggested as a way for cells to broadcast their states to the population as a whole so as to facilitate consensus.\n\nIn this paper, we propose what we believe is the first such design that has mathematically guaranteed properties of stability and auto-correction. Our approach is guided by concepts and theory from the field of \""monotone\"" dynamical systems developed by M. Hirsch, H. Smith, and others. We benchmark our design by comparing it to an existing design which has been the subject of experimental and theoretical studies, illustrating its superiority in stability and self-correction of synchronization errors. Our stability analysis, based on dynamical systems theory, guarantees global convergence to steady states, ruling out unpredictable (\""chaotic\"") behaviors and even sustained oscillations. These results are valid no matter what are the values of parameters, and are based only on the wiring diagram. The theory is complemented by extensive computational bifurcation analysis, performed for a biochemically-detailed and biologically-relevant model that we developed. Another novel feature of our approach is that our theorems on stability of steady states for homogeneous or mixed populations are valid independently of the number of cells in the population, and depend only on the relative proportions of each type of state.\n\nWhile monotone systems theory has been used previously for systems biology analysis, the current work illustrates its power for synthetic biology design, and thus has wider significance well beyond the application to the important problem of coordination of toggle switches.\n\nAuthor SummaryFor the last decade, outstanding progress has been made, and considerable practical experience has accumulated, in the construction of elementary genetic circuits that perform various tasks, such as memory storage and logical operations, in response to both exogenous and endogenous stimuli. Using modern molecular \""plug-and-play\"" technologies, various (re-)programmable cellular populations can be engineered in a routine manner, and they can be combined into more complex cellular systems.\n\nAmong all engineered synthetic circuits, a toggle, a robust bistable switch leading to a binary response dynamics, is the simplest basic synthetic biology device, analogous to the \""flip-flop\"" or latch in electronic design, and it plays a key role in biotechnology, biocomputing, and proposed gene therapies. However, despite many remarkable properties of the existing toggle designs, they must be tightly controlled in order to avoid spontaneous switching between different expression states (loss of long-term memory) or even the breakdown of stability through the generation of stable oscillations.\n\nTo address this concrete challenge, we have developed a new design for quorum-sensing synthetic toggles, based on monotone dynamical systems theory. Our design is endowed with strong theoretical guarantees that completely exclude unpredictable chaotic behaviors, as well as undesired stable oscillations, and leads to robust consensus states."
10.1101/024919,"Homeostasis is a running theme in biology. Often achieved through feedback regulation strategies, homeostasis allows living cells to control their internal environment as a means for surviving changing and unfavourable environments. While many endogenous homeostatic motifs have been studied in living cells, some other motifs may remain under-explored or even undiscovered. At the same time, known regulatory motifs have been mostly analyzed at the deterministic level, and the effect of noise on their regulatory function has received low attention. Here we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at the molecular level that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and design of robust homeostatic circuits. Using these ideas, we propose a new regulation motif, which we refer to as antithetic integral feedback, and demonstrate its effectiveness as a strategy for generically regulating a wide class of reaction networks. By combining tools from probability and control theory, we show that the proposed motif preserves the stability of the overall network, steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point, and achieves robust perfect adaptation - all with low prior knowledge of reaction rates. Moreover, our proposed regulatory motif can be implemented using a very small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load. Strikingly, the regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise, leading to enhanced regulation in scenarios where noise-free implementations result in dysregulation. Finally, we discuss the possible manifestation of the proposed antithetic integral feedback motif in endogenous biological circuits and its realization in synthetic circuits."
10.1101/024802,"A number of different models have been proposed as descriptions of the species-abundance distribution (SAD). Most evaluations of these models use only one or two models, focus only a single ecosystem or taxonomic group, or fail to use appropriate statistical methods. We use likelihood and AIC to compare the fit of four of the most widely used models to data on over 16,000 communities from a diverse array of taxonomic groups and ecosystems. Across all datasets combined the log-series, Poisson lognormal, and negative binomial all yield similar overall fits to the data. Therefore, when correcting for differences in the number of parameters the log-series generally provides the best fit to data. Within individual datasets some other distributions performed nearly as well as the log-series even after correcting for the number of parameters. The Zipf distribution is generally a poor characterization of the SAD."
10.1101/024935,"DNA methylation has the potential to influence plant growth and development through its influence on gene expression. To date, however, the evidence from plant systems is mixed as to whether patterns of DNA methylation vary significantly among tissues and, if so, whether these differences affect tissue-specific gene expression. To address these questions, we analyzed both bisulfite sequence (BSseq) and transcriptomic sequence data from three biological replicates of two tissues (leaf and floral bud) from the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon. Our first goal was to determine whether tissues were more differentiated in DNA methylation than explained by variation among biological replicates. Tissues were more differentiated than biological replicates, but the analysis of replicated data revealed high (>50%) false positive rates for the inference of differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Comparing methylation to gene expression, we found that differential CG methylation consistently covaried negatively with gene expression, regardless as to whether methylation was within genes, within their promoters or even within their closest transposable element. The relationship between gene expression and either CHG or CHH methylation was less consistent. In total, CG methylation in promoters explained 9% of the variation in tissue-specific expression across genes, suggesting that CG methylation is a minor but appreciable factor in tissue differentiation."
10.1101/024893,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as important post tran-scriptional regulators that may regulate key plant genes responsible for agronomic traits such as grain yield and stress tolerance. Several studies identified species and clades specific miRNA families associated with plant stress regulated genes. Here, we propose a novel resource that provides data related to the expression of abiotic stress responsive miRNAs in wheat, one of the most important staple food crops. This database allows the query of small RNA libraries, including in silico predicted wheat miRNA sequences and the expression profiles of small RNAs identified from those libraries. Our database also provides a direct access to online miRNA prediction software tuned to de novo miRNA detection in wheat, in monocotyledon clades, as well as in other plant species. These data and software will facilitate multiple comparative analyses and reproducible studies on small RNAs and miRNA families in plants. Our web-portal is available at: http://wheat.bioinfo.uqam.ca."
10.1101/024976,"A critical topic of insertional mutagenesis experiments performed on model organisms is mapping the hits of artificial transposons (ATs) at nucleotide level accuracy. Obviously, mapping errors may occur when sequencing artifacts or mutations as SNPs and small indels are present very close to the junction between a genomic sequence and a transposon inverted repeat (TIR). Another particular item of insertional mutagenesis is mapping of the transposon self-insertions and, to our best knowledge, there is no publicly available mapping tool designed to analyze such molecular events. We developed Genome ARTIST, a pairwise gapped aligner tool which works out both issues by means of an original, robust mapping strategy. Genome ARTIST is not designed to use NGS data but to analyze ATs insertions obtained in small to medium-scale mutagenesis experiments. Genome ARTIST employs a heuristic approach to find DNA sequence similarities and harnesses a multi-step implementation of a Smith-Waterman adapted algorithm to compute the mapping alignments. The experience is enhanced by easily customizable parameters and a user-friendly interface that describes the genomic landscape surrounding the insertion. Genome ARTIST deals with many genomes of bacteria and eukaryotes available in Ensembl and GenBank repositories. Our tool specifically harnesses/exploits the sequence annotation data provided by FlyBase for Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), which enables mapping of insertions relative to various genomic features such as natural transposons. Genome ARTIST was tested against other alignment tools using relevant query sequences derived from the D. melanogaster and Mus musculus (mouse) genomes. Real and simulated query sequences were also comparatively inquired, revealing that Genome ARTIST is a very robust solution for mapping transposon insertions.\n\nGenome ARTIST is a stand-alone user-friendly application, designed for high-accuracy mapping of transposon insertions and self-insertions. The tool is also useful for routine aligning assessments like detection of SNPs or checking the specificity of primers and probes. Genome ARTIST is an open source software and is available for download at www.genomeartist.ro and at www.bioinformatics.org."
10.1101/024950,"Despite the negative economic and ecological impact of weeds, relatively little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms that influence their persistence in agricultural fields. Here, we use a resurrection ecology approach and compare the genetic and phenotypic divergence of temporally sampled seed progenies of Ipomoeapurpurea, an agricultural weed that is resistant to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in current-day agriculture. We found striking reductions in allelic diversity between cohorts sampled nine years apart (2003 vs 2012), suggesting that populations of this species sampled from agricultural fields have experienced genetic bottleneck events that have led to lower neutral genetic diversity. Heterozygosity excess tests indicate that this bottleneck may have occurred prior to 2003. Further, a greenhouse assay of individuals sampled from the field as seed found that populations of this species, on average, exhibited modest increases in herbicide resistance over time. Our results show that populations of this noxious weed, capable of adapting to strong selection imparted by herbicide application, may lose genetic variation as a result of this or other environmental factors. We likely uncovered only modest increases in resistance between sampling cohorts due to a strong and previously identified fitness cost of resistance in this species, along with the potential that non-resistant migrants germinate from the seed bank."

To investigate the plant basal nitrogen fixation mechanisms induced in response to Bradyrhizobium, differential gene expression in root of inoculated and mock-inoculated soybean was analysed by RNA-Seq. A total of 55787 transcripts were aligned to soybean genome reference sequences, 280 and 316 transcripts were found to be up-and down-regulated, respectively, in inoculated relative to mock-inoculated soybeans root at V1 stage. Gene ontology (GO) analyses detected 104, 182 and 178 genes associated with cell component category, molecular function category and biological process category, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that 98 differentiallly expressed genes (115 transcripts) involved in 169 biological pathways. We selected 19 differentially expressed genes and analyzed their expressions in mock-inoculated, inoculated USDA110 and CCBAU45436 using qRT-PCR. The results were consistent with those obtained from rhizobia infected RNA-Seq data. These showed that the results of RNA-Seq have reliability and universality. Additionally, this study showed some novel genes associated with nitrogen fixation process comparison with the previously identified QTLs."
10.1101/024794,"ObjectiveTo compile a comprehensive summary of published human experience with levodopa given intravenously, with a focus on information required by regulatory agencies.\n\nBackgroundWhile safe intravenous use of levodopa has been documented for over 50 years, regulatory supervision for pharmaceuticals given by a route other than that approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become increasingly cautious. If delivering a drug by an alternate route raises the risk of adverse events, an investigational new drug (IND) application is required, including a comprehensive review of toxicity data.\n\nMethodsOver 200 articles referring to intravenous levodopa (IVLD) were examined for details of administration, pharmacokinetics, benefit and side effects.\n\nResultsWe identified 142 original reports describing IVLD use in humans, beginning with psychiatric research in 1959-1960 before the development of peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors. At least 2781 subjects have received IVLD, and reported outcomes include parkinsonian signs, sleep variables, hormones, hemodynamics, CSF amino acid composition, regional cerebral blood flow, cognition, perception and complex behavior. Mean pharmacokinetic variables were summarized for 49 healthy subjects and 190 with Parkinsons disease. Side effects were those expected from clinical experience with oral levodopa and dopamine agonists. No articles reported deaths or induction of psychosis.\n\nConclusionAt least 2781 patients have received i.v. levodopa with a safety profile comparable to that seen with oral administration."
10.1101/024877,"Aging is a complex continuous multifactorial process leading to loss of function and crystalizing into the many age-related diseases. Here, we explore the arguments for classifying aging as a disease in the context of the upcoming World Health Organizations 11th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), expected to be finalized in 2018. We hypothesize that classifying aging as a disease will result in new approaches and business models for addressing aging as a treatable condition, which will lead to both economic and healthcare benefits for all stakeholders. Classification of aging as a disease may lead to more efficient allocation of resources by enabling funding bodies and other stakeholders to use quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthy-years equivalent (HYE) as metrics when evaluating both research and clinical programs. We propose forming a Task Force to interface the WHO in order to develop a multidisciplinary framework for classifying aging as a disease."
10.1101/025064,"SUMMARYModern implementations of forward population genetic simulations are efficient and flexible, enabling the exploration of complex models that may otherwise be intractable. Here we describe an updated version of SFS_CODE, which has increased efficiency and includes many novel features. Among these features is an arbitrary model of dominance, the ability to simulate partial and soft selective sweeps, as well as track the trajectories of mutations and/or ancestries across multiple populations under complex models that are not possible under a coalescent framework. We also release sfs_coder, a Python wrapper to SFS_CODE allowing the user to easily generate command lines for common models of demography, selection, and human genome structure, as well as parse and simulate phenotypes from SFS_CODE output.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationOur open source software is written in C and Python, and are available under the GNU General Public License at http://sfscode.sourceforge.net.\n\nContactryan.hernandez@ucsf.edu\n\nSupplementary informationDetailed usage information is available from the project website at http://sfscode.sourceforge.net."
10.1101/025098,"BackgroundVaccines dramatically affect an individuals adaptive immune system, and thus provide an excellent means to study human immunity. Upon vaccination, the B cells that express antibodies (Abs) that happen to bind the vaccine are stimulated to proliferate and undergo mutagenesis at their Ab locus. This process may alter the composition of B cell lineages within an individual, which are known collectively as the antibody repertoire (AbR). Antibodies are also highly expressed in whole blood, potentially enabling unbiased RNA sequencing technologies to query this diversity. Less is known about the diversity of AbR responses across individuals to a given vaccine and if individuals tend to yield a similar response to the same antigenic stimulus.\n\nMethodsHere we implement a bioinformatic pipeline that extracts the AbR information from a time-series RNA-seq dataset of 5 patients who were administered a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). We harness the detailed time-series nature of this dataset and use methods based in functional data analysis (FDA) to identify the B cell lineages that respond to the vaccine. We then design and implement rigorous statistical tests in order to ask whether or not these patients exhibit a convergent AbR response to the same TIV.\n\nResultsWe find that high-resolution time-series data can be used to help identify the Ab lineages that respond to an antigenic stimulus, and that this response can exhibit a convergent nature across patients inoculated with the same vaccine. However, correlations in AbR diversity among individuals prior to inoculation can confound inference of a convergent signal unless it is taken into account.\n\nConclusionsWe developed a framework to identify the elements of an AbR that respond to an antigen. This information could be used to understand the diversity of different immune responses in different individuals, as well as to gauge the effectiveness of the immune response to a given stimulus within an individual. We also present a framework for testing a convergent hypothesis between AbRs; a hypothesis that is more difficult to test than previously appreciated. Our discovery of a convergent signal suggests that similar epitopes do select for antibodies with similar sequence characteristics."
10.1101/023432,"During meiosis, homologous chromosomes associate to form a unique structure called synaptonemal complex (SC) whose disruption leads to infertility. Information about the epigenetic features of chromatin within this structure at the level of super-resolution microscopy is largely lacking. We combined single molecule localization microscopy with quantitative analytical methods to describe the epigenetic landscape of meiotic chromosomes at the pachytene stage in mouse oocytes. DNA is found to be non-randomly distributed along the length of the SC in condensed clusters. Periodic clusters of repressive chromatin (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27, H3K27me3) are found at 500 nm intervals along the SC, while one of the ends of SC displays a large and dense cluster of centromeric histone mark (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, H3K9me3). Chromatin associated with active transcription (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, H3K4me3) is arranged in a radial hair-like loop pattern emerging laterally from the SC. These loops seem to be punctuated with small clusters of H3K4me3 mark with an average spread larger than their spacing. Our findings indicate that the nanoscale structure of the pachytene chromosomes is constrained by periodic patterns of chromatin marks, whose function in recombination and higher-order genome organisation is yet to be elucidated."
10.1101/025106,"Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Pph) is a significant bacterial pathogen of agricultural crops, and phage {phi}6 and other members of the dsRNA virus family Cystoviridae undergo lytic (virulent) infection of Pph, using the type IV pilus as the initial site of cellular attachment. Despite the popularity of Pph/phage {phi}6 as a model system in evolutionary biology, Pph resistance to phage {phi}6 remains poorly characterized. To investigate differences between phage {phi}6 resistant Pph strains, we examined genomic and gene expression variation among three bacterial genotypes that differ in the number of type IV pili expressed per cell: ordinary (wild-type), non-piliated, and super-piliated. Genome sequencing of non-piliated and super-piliated Pph identified few mutations that separate these genotypes from wild type Pph - and none present in genes known to be directly involved in type IV pilus expression. Expression analysis revealed that 81.1% of GO terms up-regulated in the non-piliated strain were down-regulated in the super-piliated strain. This differential expression is particularly prevalent in genes associated with respiration -- specifically genes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, aerobic respiration, and acetyl-CoA metabolism. The expression patterns of the TCA pathway appear to be generally up and down-regulated, in non-piliated and super-piliated Pph respectively. As pilus retraction is mediated by an ATP motor, loss of retraction ability might lead to a lower energy draw on the bacterial cell, leading to a different energy balance than wild type. The lower metabolic rate of the super-piliated strain is potentially a result of its loss of ability to retract."
10.1101/025007,"Urbanization results in pervasive habitat fragmentation and reduces standing genetic variation through bottlenecks and drift. Loss of genome-wide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genome-wide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genome-wide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10,000 SNP markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genome-wide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genome-wide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations. This study is the first to examine loss of genome-wide SNP variation along an urban-to-rural gradient and quantify urbanization as a driver of population genomic patterns."
10.1101/024992,"O_LIBiologists are increasingly using curated, public data sets to conduct phylogenetic comparative analyses. Unfortunately, there is often a mismatch between species for which there is phylogenetic data and those for which other data is available. As a result, researchers are commonly forced to either drop species from analyses entirely or else impute the missing data.\nC_LIO_LIHere we outline a simple solution to increase the overlap while avoiding potential the biases introduced by imputing data. If some external topological or taxonomic information is available, this can be used to maximize the overlap between the data and the phylogeny. We develop an algorithm that replaces a species lacking data with a species that has data. This swap can be made because for those two species, all phylogenetic relationships are exactly equivalent.\nC_LIO_LIWe have implemented our method in a new R package phyndr, which will allow researchers to apply our algorithm to empirical data sets. It is relatively efficient such that taxon swaps can be quickly computed, even for large trees. To facilitate the use of taxonomic knowledge we created a separate data package taxonlookup; it contains a curated, versioned taxonomic lookup for land plants and is interoperable with phyndr.\nC_LIO_LIEmerging online databases and statistical advances are making it possible for researchers to investigate evolutionary questions at unprecedented scales. However, in this effort species mismatch among data sources will increasingly be a problem; evolutionary informatics tools, such as phyndr and taxonlookup, can help alleviate this issue.\nC_LI"
10.1101/024851,"A selective sweep is the result of strong positive selection driving newly occurring or standing genetic variants to fixation, and can dramatically alter the pattern and distribution of allelic diversity in a population. Population-level sequencing data have enabled discoveries of selective sweeps associated with genes involved in recent adaptations in many species. In contrast, much debate but little empirical evidence addresses whether \""selfish\"" genes are capable of fixation thereby leaving signatures identical to classical selective sweeps despite being neutral or deleterious to organismal fitness. We previously described R2d2, a large copy-number variant that causes non-random segregation of mouse Chromosome 2 in females due to meiotic drive. Here we show population-genetic data consistent with a selfish sweep driven by alleles of R2d2 with high copy number (R2d2HC) in natural populations. We replicate this finding in multiple closed breeding populations from six outbred backgrounds segregating for R2d2 alleles. We find that R2d2HC rapidly increases in frequency, and in most cases becomes fixed in significantly fewer generations than can be explained by genetic drift. R2d2HC is also associated with significantly reduced litter sizes in heterozygous mothers, making it a true selfish allele. Our data provide direct evidence of populations actively undergoing selfish sweeps, and demonstrate that meiotic drive can rapidly alter the genomic landscape in favor of mutations with neutral or even negative effects on overall Darwinian fitness. Further study will reveal the incidence of selfish sweeps, and will elucidate the relative contributions of selfish genes, adaptation and genetic drift to evolution."
10.1101/025130,"Annelida represents a large and morphologically diverse group of bilaterian organisms. The recently published polychaete and leech genome sequences revealed an equally dynamic range of diversity at the genomic level. The availability of more annelid genomes will allow for the identification of evolutionary genomic events that helped shape the annelid lineage and better understand the diversity within the group. We sequenced and assembled the genome of the common earthworm, Eisenia fetida. As a first pass at understanding the diversity within the group, we classified 440 earthworm homeoboxes and compared them to those of the leech Helobdella robusta and the polychaete Capitella teleta. We inferred many gene expansions occurring in the lineage connecting the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Capitella and Eisenia to the Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA. Likewise, the lineage leading from the Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA to the leech Helobdella robusta has experienced substantial gains and losses. However, the lineage leading from Eisenia/Helobdella MRCA to E. fetida is characterized by extraordinary levels of homeobox gain. The evolutionary dynamics observed in the homeoboxes of these lineages are very likely to be generalizable to all genes. These genome expansions and losses have likely contributed to the remarkable biology exhibited in this group. These results provide a new perspective from which to understand the diversity within these lineages, show the utility of sub-draft genome assemblies for understanding genomic evolution, and provide a critical resource from which the biology of these animals can be studied. The genome data can be accessed through the Eisenia fetida Genome Portal: http://ryanlab.whitney.ufl.edu/genomes/Efet/"
10.1101/025015,"Projection analysis is a useful tool for understanding the relationship of two populations. It compares a test genome to a set of genomes from a reference population. The projections shape depends on the historical relationship of the test genomes population to the reference population. Here, we explore the effects on the projection when ancient samples are included in the analysis. First, we conduct a series of simulations in which the ancient sample is directly ancestral to a present-day population (one-population model) or the ancient sample is ancestral to a sister population that diverged before the time of sampling (two-population model). We find that there are characteristic differences between the projections for the one-population and two-population models, which indicate that the projection can be used to determine whether a test genome is directly ancestral to a present day population or not. Second, we compute projections for several published ancient genomes. We compare three Neanderthals, the Denisovan and three ancient human genomes to European, Han Chinese and Yoruba reference panels. We use a previously constructed demographic model and insert these seven ancient genomes and assess how well the observed projections are recovered."
10.1101/025171,"Variation is the spice of life or, in the case of evolution, variation is the necessary material on which selection can act to enable adaptation. Karyotypic variation in ploidy (the number of homologous chromosome sets) and aneuploidy (imbalance in the number of chromosomes) are fundamentally different than other types of genomic variants. Karyotypic variation emerges through different molecular mechanisms than other mutational events, and unlike mutations that alter the genome at the base pair level, rapid reversion to the wild type chromosome number is often possible. Although karyotypic variation has long been noted and discussed by biologists, interest in the importance of karyotypic variants in evolutionary processes has spiked in recent years, and much remains to be discovered about how karyotypic variants are produced and subsequently selected."
10.1101/025023,"Phytophthora sojae is a pathogenic oomycete that infects soybean seedlings as well as stems and roots of established plants, costing growers $1-2 billion per year. Due to its economic importance, P. sojae has become a model for the study of oomycete genetics, physiology and pathology. Despite the availability of several genome sequences, the lack of efficient techniques for targeted mutagenesis and gene replacement have long hampered genetic studies of pathogenicity in Phytophthora species. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 system enabling rapid and efficient genome editing in P. sojae. Using the RXLR effector gene Avr4/6 as target, we observed that in the absence of a homologous template, the repair of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in P. sojae was mediated by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), primarily resulting in short indels. Most mutants were homozygous, presumably due to gene conversion triggered by Cas9-mediated cleavage of non-mutant alleles. When donor DNA was present, homology directed repair (HDR) was observed, which resulted in the replacement of the target gene with the donor DNA. By testing the specific virulence of several NHEJ mutants and HDR -mediated gene replacements on soybeans, we have validated the contribution of Avr4/6 to recognition by soybean R gene loci, Rps4 and Rps6, but also uncovered additional contributions to resistance by these two loci. Our results establish a powerful tool for studying functional genomics in Phytophthora, which provides new avenues for better control of this pathogen."
10.1101/025056,"The engineering of transcriptional networks presents many challenges due to the inherent uncertainty in the system structure, changing cellular context and stochasticity in the governing dynamics. One approach to address these problems is to design and build systems that can function across a range of conditions; that is they are robust to uncertainty in their constituent components. Here we examine the robustness landscape of transcriptional oscillators, which underlie many important processes such as circadian rhythms and the cell cycle, plus also serve as a model for the engineering of complex and emergent phenomena. The central questions that we address are: Can we build genetic oscillators that are more robust than those already constructed? Can we make genetic oscillators arbitrarily robust? These questions are technically challenging due to the large model and parameter spaces that must be efficiently explored. Here we use a measure of robustness that coincides with the Bayesian model evidence combined with an efficient Monte Carlo method to traverse model space and concentrate on regions of high robustness, which enables the accurate evaluation of the relative structural robustness of gene network models governed by stochastic dynamics. We report the most robust two and three gene oscillator systems, plus examine how the number of interactions, the presence of auto-regulation, and degradation of mRNA and protein affects the frequency, amplitude and robustness of transcriptional oscillators. We also find that there is a limit to parametric robustness, beyond which there is nothing to be gained by adding additional feedback. Importantly, we provide predictions on new oscillator systems that can be constructed to verify the theory and advance design and modelling approaches to systems and synthetic biology."
10.1101/025122,"BackgroundMost species of owls (Strigidae) represent cryptic species and their taxonomic study is in flux. In recent years, two new species of owls of the genus Strix have been described from the Arabian peninsula by different research teams. It has been suggested that one of these species, S. omanensis, is not a valid species but taxonomic comparisons have been hampered by the lack of specimens of S. omanensis, and the poor state of the holotype of S. butleri.\n\nMethodsHere we use new DNA sequence data to clarify the taxonomy and nomenclature of the S. butleri complex. We also report the capture of a single S. butleri in Mashhad, Iran.\n\nResultsA cytochrome b sequence of S. omanensis was found to be identical to that of the holotype of S. butleri, indicating that the name S. omanensis is best regarded as a junior synonym of S. butleri. The identity of the S. butleri captured in Mashhad, Iran, was confirmed using DNA sequence data. This represents a major (1,400 km) range extension of this species.\n\nConclusionsThe population discovered in Oman in 2013 and originally named  S. omanensis actually represents the rediscovery of S. butleri, which was known from a single specimen and had not been recorded since 1878. The range of S. butleri extends into northeast Iran. Our study augments the body of evidence for the recognition of S. butleri and S. hadorami as separate species and highlights the importance of using multiple evidence to study cryptic owl species."
10.1101/025189,"Honey bees are exposed to a variety of environmental stressors that impact their health, including nutritional stress, pathogens, and chemicals in the environment. In particular, there has been increasing evidence that sublethal exposure to pesticides can cause subtle, yet important effects on honey bee health and behavior. Here, we add to this body of knowledge by presenting data on bee-collected pollen containing sublethal levels of cyhalothrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, which, when fed to young honey bees, results in significant changes in lifespan, nutritional physiology, and behavior. For the first time, we show that when young, nest-aged bees are presented with pollen containing field-relevant levels of cyhalothrin, they reduce their consumption of contaminated pollen. This indicates that, at least for some chemicals, young bees are able to detect contamination in pollen and change their behavioral response, even if the contamination levels do not prevent foraging honey bees from collecting the contaminated pollen."
10.1101/025239,"The capability to rapidly design proteins with novel functions will have a significant impact on medicine, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Synthetic genes are becoming a commodity, but integrated approaches have yet to be developed that take full advantage of gene synthesis. We developed a solid-phase gene synthesis method based on asymmetric primer extension (APE) and coupled this process directly to high-throughput, on-chip protein expression, purification, and characterization (mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions, MITOMI). By completely circumventing molecular cloning and cell-based steps, APE-MITOMI reduces the time between protein design and quantitative characterization to 3-4 days. With APE-MITOMI we synthesized and characterized over 440 zinc-finger (ZF) transcription factors (TF), showing that although ZF TFs can be readily engineered to recognize a particular DNA sequence, engineering the precise binding energy landscape remains challenging. We also found that it is possible to engineer ZF - DNA affinity precisely and independently of sequence specificity and that in silico modeling can explain some of the observed affinity differences. APE-MITOMI is a generic approach that should facilitate fundamental studies in protein biophysics, and protein design/engineering."
10.1101/025262,"The rapid development of high throughput experimental techniques has resulted in a growing diversity of genomic datasets being produced and requiring analysis. A variety of computational techniques allow us to analyse such data and to model the biological processes behind them. However, it is increasingly being recognised that we can gain deeper understanding by combining the insights obtained from multiple, diverse datasets. We therefore require scalable computational approaches for data fusion.\n\nWe propose a novel methodology for scalable unsupervised data fusion. Our technique exploits network representations of the data in order to identify (and quantify) similarities among the datasets. We may work within the Bayesian formalism, using Bayesian nonparametric approaches to model each dataset; or (for fast, approximate, and massive scale data fusion) can naturally switch to more heuristic modelling techniques. An advantage of the proposed approach is that each dataset can initially be modelled independently (and therefore in parallel), before applying a fast post-processing step in order to perform data fusion. This allows us to incorporate new experimental data in an online fashion, without having to rerun all of the analysis. The methodology can be applied to genomic scale datasets and we demonstrate its applicability on examples from the literature, using a broad range of genomic datasets, and also on a recent gene expression dataset from Sporadic inclusion body myositis Availability.

10.1101/025197,"Cancer cells have a more hyperpolarised mitochondrial membrane potential ({Psi}IM) than normal cells. {Psi}IM = [~]-220 mV in cancer cells as compared to [~]-140 mV in normal cells. Until now it has not been known why. This paper explains this disparity, in a mathematical framework, and identifies molecular targets and operations unique to cancer cells. These are thence prospective cancer drug targets. BMS-199264 is proposed as an anti-cancer drug. It inhibits the reverse, proton-pumping mode of ATP synthase, which this paper identifies as crucial to cancer cells but not to healthy, normal adult cells. In the cancer cell model, the adenine nucleotide exchanger (ANT) is inversely orientated in the mitochondrial inner membrane as compared to normal cells. This predicts it to have a different drug interaction profile, which can be leveraged for cancer therapy. Uncouplers, which dissipate the proton motive force, are proposed as anti-cancer medicines e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenol."
10.1101/025221,"The environmental effects of ischemia on chromatin nanostructure were evaluated using single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) of DNA binding dyes. Short-term oxygen and nutrient deprivation (OND) of the cardiomyocyte cell-line HL-1induces a previously undescribed chromatin architecture, consisting of large, chromatin sparse voids interspersed between DNA-dense hollow helicoid structures of the order of 40 to 700 nm in dimension. OND induced chromatin compaction is reversible, and upon restitution of normoxia and nutrients, chromatin transiently adopts a significantly more open structure than in untreated cells. We show that this compacted state of chromatin reduces transcription, while the open chromatin structure following recovery has a higher transcriptional rate than in untreated cells. Digestion of chromatin with DNAseI and DNA binding dye loading assays confirm that OND induces compaction of chromatin and a general redistribution of chromatin to the nuclear periphery. Mechanistically, chromatin compaction is associated with a depletion of intracellular ATP and a redistribution of the cellular polyamine pool into the nucleus. Additionally, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) shows that core histones are not displaced from compacted chromatin and that the mobility of linker histone H1 is considerably reduced by OND treatment, to an extent that far exceeds the difference in histone H1 mobility between heterochromatin and euchromatin. These studies exemplify the dynamic capacity of chromatin architecture to physically respond to environmental conditions, directly link cellular energy status to chromatin compaction and provide insight into the effect ischemia has on the nuclear architecture of cells."
10.1101/025254,"The parthenogenetic all-female marbled crayfish is a novel research model and potent invader of freshwater ecosystems. It is a triploid descendant of the sexually reproducing slough crayfish, Procambarus fallax, but its taxonomic status has remained unsettled. By crossbreeding experiments and parentage analysis we show here that marbled crayfish and P. fallax are reproductively separated. Both crayfish copulate readily, suggesting that the reproductive barrier is set at the cytogenetic rather than the behavioural level. Analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes of marbled crayfish from laboratory lineages and wild populations demonstrates genetic identity and indicates a single origin. Flow cytometric comparison of DNA contents of haemocytes and analysis of nuclear microsatellite loci confirm triploidy and suggest autopolyploidization as its cause. Global DNA methylation is significantly reduced in marbled crayfish implying the involvement of molecular epigenetic mechanisms in its origination. Morphologically, both crayfish are very similar but growth and fecundity are considerably larger in marbled crayfish, making it a different animal with superior fitness. These data and the high probability of a divergent future evolution of the marbled crayfish and P. fallax clusters suggest that marbled crayfish should be considered as an independent asexual species. Our findings also establish the P. fallax-marbled crayfish pair as a novel paradigm for rare chromosomal speciation by autopolyploidy and parthenogenesis in animals and for saltational evolution in general."
10.1101/025148,"Portable DNA sequencers such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION device have the potential to be truly disruptive technologies, facilitating new approaches and analyses and, in some cases, taking sequencing out of the lab and into the field. However, the capabilities of these technologies are still being revealed. Here we show that single-molecule cDNA sequencing using the MinION accurately characterises venom toxin-encoding genes in the painted saw-scaled viper, Echis coloratus. We find the raw sequencing error rate to be around 12%, improved to 0-2% with hybrid error correction and 3% with de novo error correction. Our corrected data provides full coding sequences and 5' and 3' UTRs for 29 of 33 candidate venom toxins detected, far superior to Illumina data (13/40 complete) and Sanger-based ESTs (15/29). We suggest that, should the current pace of improvement continue, the MinION will become the default approach for cDNA sequencing in a variety of species."
10.1101/025205,"AbstractIsolation of endogenous proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been facilitated by inserting encoding polypeptide affinity tags at the C-termini of chromosomal open reading frames (ORFs) using homologous recombination of DNA fragments. The tagged protein isolation is limited by a number of factors, including high cost of affinity resins for bulk isolation and low concentration of ligands on the resin surface, leading to low isolation efficiencies and trapping of contaminants. To address this we have created a recombinant \""CelTag\"" DNA construct from which PCR fragments can be created to easily tag C-termini of S. cerevisiae ORFs using selection for a nat1 marker. The tag has a C-terminal cellulose binding module to be used in the first affinity step. Microgranular cellulose is very inexpensive and has an effectively continuous ligand on its surface, allowing rapid, highly efficient purification with minimal background in a single step. Cellulose-bound proteins are released by specific cleavage of an included site for TEV protease, giving nearly pure product. The tag can be lifted from the recombinant DNA construct either with or without a 13x myc epitope tag between the target ORF and the TEV protease site. Binding of CelTag protein fusions to cellulose is stable to high salt, nonionic detergents, and 1 M urea, allowing stringent washing conditions to remove loosely associated components, as needed, before specific elution. It is anticipated that this reagent will allow isolation of rare or unstable protein complexes from large quantities of yeast extract, including soluble, membrane-bound, or chromatin-associated assemblies."
10.1101/025346,"AbstractCollective cell responses to exogenous cues depend on cell-cell interactions. In principle, these can result in enhanced sensitivity to weak and noisy stimuli. However, this has not yet been shown experimentally, and, little is known about how multicellular signal processing modulates single cell sensitivity to extracellular signaling inputs, including those guiding complex changes in the tissue form and function. Here we explored if cell-cell communication can enhance the ability of cell ensembles to sense and respond to weak gradients of chemotactic cues. Using a combination of experiments with mammary epithelial cells and mathematical modeling, we find that multicellular sensing enables detection of and response to shallow Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) gradients that are undetectable by single cells. However, the advantage of this type of gradient sensing is limited by the noisiness of the signaling relay, necessary to integrate spatially distributed ligand concentration information. We calculate the fundamental sensory limits imposed by this communication noise and combine them with the experimental data to estimate the effective size of multicellular sensory groups involved in gradient sensing. Functional experiments strongly implicated intercellular communication through gap junctions and calcium release from intracellular stores as mediators of collective gradient sensing. The resulting integrative analysis provides a framework for understanding the advantages and limitations of sensory information processing by relays of chemically coupled cells."
10.1101/025338,"Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malarial species in South America and exerts a substantial burden on the populations it affects. The control and eventual elimination of P. vivax are global health priorities. Genomic research contributes to this objective by improving our understanding of the biology of P. vivax and through the development of new genetic markers that can be used to monitor efforts to reduce malaria transmission.\n\nHere we analyze whole-genome data from eight field samples from a region in Cordoba, Colombia where malaria is endemic. We find considerable genetic diversity within this population, a result that contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that P. vivax had limited diversity in the Americas. We also identify a selective sweep around a substitution known to confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). This is the first observation of a selective sweep for SP resistance in this species. These results indicate that P. vivax has been exposed to SP pressure even when the drug is not in use as a first line treatment for patients afflicted by this parasite. We identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions in three other genes known to be involved with drug resistance in Plasmodium species. Finally, we found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms. Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough P. vivax is not as deadly as the more widely studied P. falciparum, it remains a pressing global health problem. Here we report the results of a whole-genome study of P. vivax from Cordoba, Colombia, in South America. This parasite is the most prevalent in this region. We show that the parasite population is genetically diverse, which is contrary to expectations from earlier studies from the Americas. We also find molecular evidence that resistance to an anti-malarial drug has arisen recently in this region. This selective sweep indicates that the parasite has been exposed to a drug that is not used as first-line treatment for this malaria parasite. In addition to extensive single nucleotide and microsatellite polymorphism, we report 18 new genetic loci that might be helpful for fine-scale studies of this species in the Americas."
10.1101/025411,"Aging is commonly described as being a continuous process affecting progressively organisms as time passes. This process results in a progressive decrease in individuals fitness through a wide range of both organismal - decreased motor activity, fertility, resistance to stress - and molecular phenotypes - decreased protein and energy homeostasis, impairment of insulin signaling. In the past 20 years, numerous genes have been identified as playing a major role in the aging process, yet little is known about the events leading to that loss of fitness. We recently described an event characterized by a dramatic increase of intestinal permeability to a blue food dye in aging flies committed to die within a few days. Importantly, flies showing this so called  Smurf phenotype are the only ones, among a population, to show various age-related changes and exhibit a high-risk of impending death whatever their chronological age. Thus, these observations suggest that instead of being one continuous phenomenon, aging may be a discontinuous process well described by at least two distinguishable phases. In this paper we addressed this hypothesis by implementing a new 2-Phases of Aging mathematiCal model (2PAC model) to simulate longevity curves based on the simple hypothesis of two consecutive phases of lifetime presenting different properties. We first present a unique equation for each phase and discuss the biological significance of the 3 associated parameters. Then we evaluate the influence of each parameter on the shape of survival curves. Overall, this new mathematical model, based on simple biological observations, is able to reproduce many experimental longevity curves, supporting the existence of 2-phases of aging exhibiting specific properties and separated by a dramatic transition that remains to be characterized. Moreover, it indicates that Smurf survival can be approximated by one single constant parameter for a broad range of genotypes that we have tested under our environmental conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe perception we can have of a process directly affects the way we study it. In the literature, aging is generally described as being a continuous process, progressively affecting organisms through a broad range of molecular and physiological changes ultimately leading to a dramatic decrease of individuals life expectancy. As such, aging studies focus on changes occurring in groups of individuals through time, considering individuals taken at a given time as being all equivalent. Instead, the recently described Smurf phenotype [1] suggested that any given time, a population could be divided in two subpopulations each characterized by a significantly different risk of impending death.\n\nBy formalizing here the concept of a discontinuous aging process using a mathematical model based on simple experimental observations, we propose a theoretical framework in which aging is actually separated in two consecutive phases characterized by three parameters easily quantifiable in vivo. Thus, the model we present here brings new tools to assess the events occurring during aging using a novel angle that we hope will open a better understanding of the very processes driving aging."
10.1101/025387,"Large-scale sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has been a boon to the quantitative analysis of transcriptomes. A notable application is the detection of changes in transcript usage between experimental conditions. For example, discovery of pathological alternative splicing may allow the development of new treatments or better management of patients. From an analysis perspective, there are several ways to approach RNA-seq data to unravel differential transcript usage, such as annotation-based exon-level counting, differential analysis of the  percent spliced in measure or quantitative analysis of assembled transcripts. The goal of this research is to compare and contrast current state-of-the-art methods, as well as to suggest improvements to commonly used workflows.\n\nWe assess the performance of representative workflows using synthetic data and explore the effect of using non-standard counting bin definitions as input to a state-of-the-art inference engine (DEXSeq). Although the canonical counting provided the best results overall, several non-canonical approaches were as good or better in specific aspects and most counting approaches outperformed the evaluated event- and assembly-based methods. We show that an incomplete annotation catalog can have a detrimental effect on the ability to detect differential transcript usage in transcriptomes with few isoforms per gene and that isoform-level pre-filtering can considerably improve false discovery rate (FDR) control.\n\nCount-based methods generally perform well in detection of differential transcript usage. Controlling the FDR at the imposed threshold is difficult, mainly in complex organisms, but can be improved by pre-filtering of the annotation catalog."
10.1101/025288,"Differentiating pluripotent cells from fibroblast progenitors is a potentially transformative tool in personalized medicine. We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). While these cultured fibroblasts were several generations removed from the primary tissue and morphologically indistinguishable, we found widespread epigenetic differences by sampling location at the single CpG (N=101,989), region (N=697), \""block\"" (N=243), and global spatial scales suggesting a strong epigenetic memory of original fibroblast location. Furthermore, many of these epigenetic differences manifested in the transcriptome, particularly at the region-level. We further identified 7,265 CpGs and 11 regions showing significant epigenetic memory related to the age of the donor, as well as an overall increased epigenetic variability, preferentially in scalp-derived fibroblasts -83% of loci were more variable in scalp, hypothesized to result from cumulative exposure to environmental stimuli in the primary tissue. By integrating publicly available DNA methylation datasets on individual cell populations in blood and brain, we identified significantly increased inter-individual variability in our scalp- and other skin-derived fibroblasts on a similar scale as epigenetic differences between different lineages of blood cells. Lastly, these epigenetic differences did not appear to be driven by somatic mutation - while we identified 64 probable de-novo variants across the 11 subjects, there was no association between mutation burden and age of the donor (p=0.71). These results depict a strong component of epigenetic memory in cell culture from primary tissue, even after several generations of daughter cells, related to cell state and donor age."
10.1101/025247,"Unlike passive rupture of the human chorioamnion at birth, the insect extraembryonic (EE) tissues - the amnion and serosa - actively rupture and withdraw in late embryogenesis. Despite its importance for successful development, EE morphogenesis remains poorly understood. Contradicting the hypothesis of a single, fused EE membrane, we show that both tissues persist as discrete epithelia within a bilayer, using new tissue-specific EGFP transgenic lines in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Quantitative live imaging analyses show that the amnion initiates EE rupture in a specialized anterior-ventral cap, while RNAi manipulation of EE tissue complement and function reveals that the serosa is autonomously contractile. Thus the bilayer efficiently coordinates the amnion as initiator and serosa as driver to achieve withdrawal. The novel bilayer architecture may reflect evolutionary changes in the EE tissues specific to holometabolous insects. More generally, tissue apposition in a bilayer exemplifies a high degree of functional interaction between developing epithelia."
10.1101/025353,"The demographic history of most species is complex, with multiple evolutionary processes combining to shape the observed patterns of genetic diversity. To infer this history, the discipline of phylogeography has (to date) used models that simplify the historical demography of the focal organism, for example by assuming or ignoring ongoing gene flow between populations or by requiring a priori specification of divergence history. Since no single model incorporates every possible evolutionary process, researchers rely on intuition to choose the models that they use to analyze their data. Here, we develop an approach to circumvent this reliance on intuition. PHRAPL allows users to calculate the probability of a large number of demographic histories given their data, enabling them to identify the optimal model and produce accurate parameter estimates for a given system. Using PHRAPL, we reanalyze data from 19 recent phylogeographic investigations. Results indicate that the optimal models for most datasets parameterize both gene flow and population divergence, and suggest that species tree methods (which do not consider gene flow) are overly simplistic for most phylogeographic systems. These results highlight the importance of phylogeographic model selection, and reinforce the role of phylogeography as a bridge between population genetics and phylogenetics."
10.1101/025379,"BackgroundGenotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is becoming an attractive alternative to array-based methods for genotyping individuals for a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Costs can be lowered by reducing the mean sequencing depth, but this results in genotype calls of lower quality. A common analysis strategy is to filter SNPs to just those with sufficient depth, thereby greatly reducing the number of SNPs available. We investigate methods for estimating relatedness using GBS data, including results of low depth, using theoretical calculation, simulation and application to a real data set.\n\nResultsWe show that unbiased estimates of relatedness can be obtained by using only those SNPs with genotype calls in both individuals. The expected value of this estimator is independent of the SNP depth in each individual, under a model of genotype calling that includes the special case of the two alleles being read at random. In contrast, the estimator of self-relatedness does depend on the SNP depth, and we provide a modification to provide unbiased estimates of self-relatedness. We refer to these methods of estimation as kinship using GBS with depth adjustment (KGD). The estimators can be calculated using matrix methods, which allow efficient computation. Simulation results were consistent with the methods being unbiased, and suggest that the optimal sequencing depth is around 2-4 for relatedness between individuals and 5-10 for self-relatedness. Application to a real data set revealed that some SNP filtering may still be necessary, for the exclusion of SNPs which did not behave in a Mendelian fashion. A simple graphical method (a  fin plot) is given to illustrate this issue and to guide filtering parameters.\n\nConclusionWe provide a method which gives unbiased estimates of relatedness, based on SNPs assayed by GBS, which accounts for the depth (including zero depth) of the genotype calls. This allows GBS to be applied at read depths which can be chosen to optimise the information obtained. SNPs with excess heterozygosity, often due to (partial) polyploidy or other duplications can be filtered based on a simple graphical method."
10.1101/025114,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDescending pathways are important modulators of motor networks and allow the dynamic adjustment of behaviors to changing internal and external conditions. Central pattern generating networks (CPG) have been particularly amenable to study the modulation of motor networks and demonstrated that virtually all levels of information processing are controlled by descending projections. CPGs receive sensory feedback and while it is known that sensory activity can be gated by central pathways, we here present for the first time that descending projection neurons modulate action potential initiation in sensory neurons.\n\nWe used the fact that the anterior gastric receptor neuron (AGR), a single-cell bipolar muscle tendon organ in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, generates spontaneous ectopic action potentials in its axon. We found that axonal spike initiation is under direct neuromodulatory control by a pair of descending projection neurons. These IV (inferior ventricular) neurons descend from the brain and are known to control CPGs in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). Activation of the IV neurons elicited a long-lasting decrease in AGR ectopic spike activity. This decrease was only observed when spikes were generated ectopically in the central portion of the axon, i.e. the modulation was specific to the site of spontaneous spike initiation. The decrease could be mimicked by focal application of the IV neuron co-transmitter histamine and IV neuron actions were diminished after blocking H2 receptors, indicating a direct descending modulation of the axonal spike initiation site. In contrast, the propagation dynamics of en-passant action potentials were not affected. Descending modulatory projection neurons therefore control axonal spike initiation in sensory neurons without affecting afferent spike propagation to increase the physiological activity repertoire of sensory pathways."

10.1101/025445,"Heterogeneity across cancer makes it difficult to find driver genes with intermediate (2-20%) and low frequency (<2%) mutations1, and we are potentially missing entire classes of networks (or pathways) of biological and therapeutic value. Here, we quantify the extent to which cancer genes across 21 tumor types have an increased burden of mutations in their immediate gene network derived from functional genomics data. We formalize a classifier that accurately calculates the significance level of a genes network mutation burden (NMB) and show it can accurately predict known cancer genes and recently proposed driver genes in the majority of tested tumours. Our approach predicts 62 putative cancer genes, including 35 with clear connection to cancer and 27 genes, which point to new cancer biology. NMB identifies proportionally more (4x) low-frequency mutated genes as putative cancer genes than gene-based tests, and provides molecular clues in patients without established driver mutations. Our quantitative and comparative analysis of pan-cancer networks across 21 tumour types gives new insights into the biological and genetic architecture of cancers and enables additional discovery from existing cancer genomes. The framework we present here should become increasingly useful with more sequencing data in the future."
10.1101/025429,"AbstractsThe genetic diversity within a single tumor can be extremely large, possibly with mutations at all coding sites (Ling et al. 2015). In this study, we analyzed 12 cases of multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors by sequencing and genotyping several samples from each case. In 10 cases, tumors are clonally related by a process of cell migration and colonization. They permit a detailed analysis of the evolutionary forces (mutation, migration, drift and natural selection) that influence the genetic diversity both within and between tumors. In 23 inter-tumor comparisons, the descendant tumor usually shows a higher growth rate than the parent tumor. In contrast, neutral diversity dominates within-tumor observations such that adaptively growing clones are rarely found. The apparent adaptive evolution between tumors can be explained by the inherent bias for detecting larger tumors that have a growth advantage. Beyond these tumors are a far larger number of clones which, growing at a neutral rate and too small to see, can nevertheless be verified by molecular means. Given that the estimated genetic diversity is often very large, therapeutic strategies need to take into account the pre-existence of many drug-resistance mutations. Importantly, these mutations are expected to be in the very low frequency range in the primary tumors (and become frequent in the relapses, as is indeed reported (1-3). In conclusion, tumors may often harbor a very large number of mutations in the very low frequency range. This duality provides both a challenge and an opportunity for designing strategies against drug resistance (4-8).\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe total genetic diversity across all tumors of a single patient, with large number of low frequency mutations driven by neutral and adaptive forces, presents both a challenge and an opportunity for new cancer therapeutics."
10.1101/025544,"Marine viruses are critical drivers of ocean biogeochemistry and their abundances vary spatiotemporally in the global oceans, with upper estimates exceeding 108 per ml. Over many years, a consensus has emerged that virus abundances are typically 10-fold higher than prokaryote abundances. The use of a fixed-ratio suggests that the relationship between virus and prokaryote abundances is both predictable and linear. However, the true explanatory power of a linear relationship and its robustness across diverse ocean environments is unclear. Here, we compile 5671 prokaryote and virus abundance estimates from 25 distinct marine surveys to characterize the relationship between virus and prokaryote abundances. We find that the median virus-to-prokaryote ratio (VPR) is 10:1 and 16:1 in the near-and sub-surface oceans, respectively. Nonetheless, we observe substantial variation in the VPR and find either no or limited explanatory power using fixed-ratio models. Instead, virus abundances are better described as nonlinear, power-law functions of prokaryote abundances - particularly when considering relationships within distinct marine surveys. Estimated power-laws have scaling exponents that are typically less than 1, signifying that the VPR decreases with prokaryote density, rather than remaining fixed. The emergence of power-law scaling presents a challenge for mechanistic models seeking to understand the ecological causes and consequences of marine virus-microbe interactions. Such power-law scaling also implies that efforts to average viral effects on microbial mortality and biogeochemical cycles using \""representative\"" abundances or abundance-ratios need to be refined if they are to be utilized to make quantitative predictions at regional or global ocean scales."
10.1101/025569,"State-based Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models have become an often used method for assessing states or conditions of free-ranging animals through time. Although originally envisioned to account for differences in survival and observation processes when animals are moving though various geographical strata, the model has evolved to model vital rates in different life-history or diseased states. We further extend this useful class of models to the case of multivariate state data. Researchers can record values of several different states of interest; e.g., geographic location and reproductive state. Traditionally, these would be aggregated into one state with a single probability of state uncertainty. However, by modeling states as a multivariate vector, one can account for partial knowledge of the vector as well as dependence between the state variables in a parsimonious way. A hidden Markov model (HMM) formulation allows straightforward maximum likelihood inference. The proposed HMM models are demonstrated with a case study using data from a California sea lion vital rates study."
10.1101/025494,"For several species, refuges (such as burrows, dens, roosts, nests) are an essential resource for protection from predators and extreme environmental conditions. Refuges also serve as focal sites for social interactions including mating, courtship and aggression. Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary - the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents. In a species that is not social, our study highlights the importance of leveraging refuge use behavior to study the presence of and mechanisms behind non-random social structure and individual-level variation. Our analysis of the impact of stressors on refuge-based social structure further emphasizes the potential of this method to detect environmental or anthropogenic disturbances.\n\nSignificance statement: Adaptive and social behavior that affects fitness is now being increasingly incorporated in the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, direct observations of social interactions in species considered to be solitary are difficult, and therefore integration of behavior in conservation and management decisions in such species has been infrequent. For such species, we propose quantifying refuge use behavior as it can provide insights towards their (hidden) social structure, establish relevant contact patterns of infectious disease spread, and provide early warning signals of population stressors. Our study highlights this approach in a long-lived and threatened species, the desert tortoise. We provide evidence towards the presence of and identify mechanisms behind the social structure in desert tortoises formed by their burrow use preferences. We also show how individuals burrow use behavior responds to the presence of population stressors."

10.1101/025502,"Simple and ubiquitous gene interactions create rugged fitness landscapes composed of coadapted gene complexes separated by ""valleys"" of low fitness. Crossing such fitness valleys allows a population to escape suboptimal local fitness peaks to become better adapted. This is the premise of Sewall Wright's shifting balance process. Here we generalize the theory of fitness-valley crossing in the two-locus, biallelic case by allowing bias in parent-offspring transmission. This generalization extends the existing mathematical framework to genetic systems with segregation distortion and uniparental inheritance. Our results are also flexible enough to provide insight into shifts between alternate stable states in cultural systems with ""transmission valleys"". Using a semi-deterministic analysis and a stochastic diffusion approximation, we focus on the limiting step in valley crossing: the first appearance of the genotype on the new fitness peak whose lineage will eventually fix. We then apply our results to specific cases of segregation distortion, uniparental inheritance, and cultural transmission. Segregation distortion favouring mutant alleles facilitates crossing most when recombination and mutation are rare, i.e., scenarios where crossing is otherwise unlikely. Interactions with more mutable genes (e.g., uniparental inherited cytoplasmic elements) substantially reduce crossing times. Despite component traits being passed on poorly in the previous cultural background, small advantages in the transmission of a new combination of cultural traits can greatly facilitate a cultural transition. While peak shifts are unlikely under many of the common assumptions of population genetic theory, relaxing some of these assumptions can promote fitness-valley crossing."
10.1101/025577,"We previously proposed a simple regression-based method to map quantitative trait loci underlying function-valued phenotypes. In order to better handle the case of noisy phenotype measurements and accommodate the correlation structure among time points, we propose an alternative approach that maintains much of the simplicity and speed of the regression-based method. We overcome noisy measurements by replacing the observed data with a smooth approximation. We then apply functional principal component analysis, replacing the smoothed phenotype data with a small number of principal components. Quantitative trait locus mapping is applied to these dimension-reduced data, either with a multi-trait method or by considering the traits individually and then taking the average or maximum LOD score across traits. We apply these approaches to root gravitropism data on Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines and further investigate their performance in computer simulations. Our methods have been implemented in the R package, funqtl."
10.1101/025528,"Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-Seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, gene expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem."
10.1101/025510,"Due to recent advances in reprogramming cell phenotypes, many efforts have been dedicated to developing reverse engineering procedures for the identification of gene regulatory networks that emulate dynamical properties associated with the cell fates of a given biological system. In this work, we propose a systems biology approach for the reconstruction of the gene regulatory network underlying the dynamics of the Trypanosoma cruzis life cycle. By means of an optimisation procedure, we embedded the steady state maintenance, and the known phenotypic transitions between these steady states in response to environmental cues, into the dynamics of a gene network model. In the resulting network architecture we identified a small subnetwork, formed by seven interconnected nodes, that controls the parasites life cycle. The present approach could be useful for better understanding other single cell organisms with multiple developmental stages.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/025452,"Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational regulatory process that can control protein stability, localization, and activity. Ubiquitin is essential for eukaryotic life and is highly conserved, varying in only 3 amino acid positions between yeast and humans. However, recent deep sequencing studies in S. cerevisiae indicate that ubiquitin is highly tolerant to single amino acid mutations. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesized that the set of tolerated substitutions would be reduced when the cultures are not grown in rich media conditions and that chemically induced physiologic perturbations might unmask constraints on the ubiquitin sequence. To test this hypothesis, a class of first year UCSF graduate students employed a deep mutational scanning procedure to determine the fitness landscape of a library of all possible single amino acid mutations of ubiquitin in the presence of one of five small molecule perturbations: MG132, Dithiothreitol (DTT), Hydroxyurea (HU), Caffeine, and DMSO. Our data reveal that the number of tolerated substitutions is greatly reduced by DTT, HU, or Caffeine, and that these perturbations uncover \""shared sensitized positions\"" localized to areas around the hydrophobic patch and to the C-terminus. We also show perturbation specific effects including the sensitization of His68 in HU and tolerance to mutation at Lys63 in DTT. Taken together, our data suggest that chemical stress reduces buffering effects in the ubiquitin proteasome system, revealing previously hidden fitness defects. By expanding the set of chemical perturbations assayed, potentially by other classroom-based experiences, we will be able to further address the apparent dichotomy between the extreme sequence conservation and the experimentally observed mutational tolerance of ubiquitin. Finally, this study demonstrates the realized potential of a project lab-based interdisciplinary graduate curriculum."

Despite its acknowledged utility, this method is of limited use with degraded DNA samples, such as those isolated from museum specimens, as these samples are less likely to harbor fragments long enough to comprise two restriction sites making possible ligation of the adapter sequences (in the case of double-digest RAD) or performing size selection of the resulting fragments (in the case of single-digest RAD). Here, we address these limitations by presenting a novel method called hybridization RAD (hyRAD). In this approach, biotinylated RAD fragments, covering a random fraction of the genome, are used as baits for capturing homologous fragments from genomic shotgun sequencing libraries. This simple and cost-effective approach allows sequencing of orthologous loci even from highly degraded DNA samples, opening new avenues of research in the field of museum genomics. Not relying on the restriction site presence, it improves among-sample loci coverage. In a trial study, hyRAD allowed us to obtain a large set of orthologous loci from fresh and museum samples from a non-model butterfly species, with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms present in all eight analyzed specimens, including 58-year-old museum samples. The utility of the method was further validated using 49 museum and fresh samples of a Palearctic grasshopper species for which the spatial genetic structure was previously assessed using mtDNA amplicons. The application of the method is eventually discussed in a wider context. As it does not rely on the restriction site presence, it is therefore not sensitive to among-sample loci polymorphisms in the restriction sites that usually causes loci dropout. This should enable the application of hyRAD to analyses at broader evolutionary scales."
10.1101/025585,"To decrypt the regulatory code of the genome, sequence elements must be defined that determine the kinetics of RNA metabolism and thus gene expression. Here we attempt such decryption in an eukaryotic model organism, the fission yeast S. pombe. We first derive an improved genome annotation that redefines borders of 36% of expressed mRNAs and adds 487 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We then combine RNA labeling in vivo with mathematical modeling to obtain rates of RNA synthesis and degradation for 5,484 expressed RNAs and splicing rates for 4,958 introns. We identify functional sequence elements in DNA and RNA that control RNA metabolic rates, and quantify the contributions of individual nucleotides to RNA synthesis, splicing, and degradation. Our approach reveals distinct kinetics of mRNA and ncRNA metabolism, separates antisense regulation by transcription interference from RNA interference, and provides a general tool for studying the regulatory code of genomes."
10.1101/025486,"Islands are or have been occupied by unusual species, such as dwarf proboscideans and giant rodents. The discussion of the classical but controversial \""island rule,\"" which states that mammalian body sizes converge on intermediate sizes on islands, has been stimulated by these unusual species. In this paper, we use an unprecedented global data set of the distributions and the body sizes of mammals and a novel analytical method to analyze body size evolution on islands; the analyses produced strong support for the island rule. Islands have suffered massive human-driven losses of species, and we found that the support for the island rule was substantially stronger when the many late-Quaternary extinct species were also considered (particularly, the tendency for dwarfing in large taxa). In this study, the decisive support generated for the island rule confirmed that evolution is markedly different on islands and that human impact may obscure even fundamental evolutionary patterns."
10.1101/025619,"In a recent paper published in PNAS (Golan et al. 2014)1, residual maximum likelihood (REML) seriously underestimated genetic variance explained by genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism when using a case-control design. It was concluded that Haseman-Elston regression (denoted as PCGC in their paper) should be used instead of REML. Their conclusions were based on results from simplified linkage equilibrium SNP simulation (SLES), which the authors acknowledged may be unrealistic. We found that their simulation, SLES, unrealistically inflated the correlation between the eigenvectors of the genomic relationship matrix and disease status to values that are rarely observed in real data analyses. With a more realistic simulation that the authors failed to carry out (as they noted in their paper), we showed that there was no such inflated correlation between the eigenvectors of the genomic relationship matrix and disease status. Because REML uses the eigensystem of covariance structure, the inflated correlation artefactually constrained its estimates. We compared SNP-heritabilities from SLES and a more realistic simulation, showing that there was a substantial difference between the REML estimates from the two simulation strategies. Finally, we presented that there was no difference between REML and PCGC in real data analyses. This pattern from real data results differed strikingly from the pattern in the simulation study of Golan et al.1. One needs to be cautious of results drawn from SLES."
10.1101/025601,"We accumulated mutations for 1952 generations in 79 initially identical, haploid lines of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and then performed whole-genome sequencing to determine the mutation rates and spectrum. We captured 696 spontaneous mutations across the 79 mutation accumulation lines. We compared the mutation spectrum and rate to another model ascomycetous yeast, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While the two organisms are approximately 600 million years diverged from each other, they share similar life histories, genome size and genomic G/C content. We found that Sc. pombe and S. cerevisiae have similar mutation rates, contrary to what was expected given Sc. pombes smaller reported effective population size. Sc. pombes also exhibits a strong insertion bias in comparison to S. cerevisiae. Intriguingly, we observed an increased mutation rate at cytosine nucleotides, specifically CpG nucleotides, which is also seen in S. cerevisiae. However, the absence of methylation in Sc. pombe and the pattern of mutation at these sites, primarily C[-&gt;] A as opposed to C[-&gt;]T, strongly suggest that the increased mutation rate is not caused by deamination of methylated cytosines. This result implies that the high mutability of CpG dinucleotides in other species may be caused in part by an additional mechanism than methylation."
10.1101/025676,"The heterodimeric T cell receptor (TCR) comprises two protein chains that pair to determine the antigen specificity of each T lymphocyte. The enormous sequence diversity within TCR repertoires allows specific TCR sequences to be used as lineage markers for T cells that derive from a common progenitor. We have developed a computational method, called TraCeR, to reconstruct full-length, paired TCR sequences from T lymphocyte single-cell RNA-seq by combining existing assembly and alignment programs with a \""synthetic genome\"" library comprising all possible TCR sequences. We validate this method with PCR to quantify its accuracy and sensitivity, and compare to other TCR sequencing methods. Our inferred TCR sequences reveal clonal relationships between T cells, which we put into the context of each cells functional state from the complete transcriptional landscape quantified from the remaining RNA-seq data. This provides a powerful tool to link T cell specificity with functional response in a variety of normal and pathological conditions. We demonstrate this by determining the distribution of members of expanded T cell clonotypes in response to Salmonella infection in the mouse. We show that members of the same clonotype span early activated CD4+ T cells, as well as mature effector and memory cells."
10.1101/025684,"We give recursions for the expected site-frequency spectrum associated with so-called Xi-coalescents, that is exchangeable coalescents which admit simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. Xi-coalescents arise, for example, in association with population models of skewed offspring distributions with diploidy, recurrent advantageous mutations, or strong bottlenecks. In contrast, the simpler Lambda-coalescents admit multiple mergers of lineages, but at most one such merger each time. Xi-coalescents, as well as Lambda-coalescents, can predict an excess of singletons, compared to the Kingman coalescent. We compare estimates of coalescent parameters when Xi-coalescents are applied to data generated by Lambda-coalescents, and vice versa. In general, Xi-coalescents predict fewer singletons than corresponding Lambda-coalescents, but a higher count of mutations of size larger than singletons. We fit examples of Xi-coalescents to unfolded site-frequency spectra obtained for autosomal loci of the diploid Atlantic cod, and obtain different coalescent parameter estimates than obtained with corresponding Lambda-coalescents. Our results provide new inference tools, and suggest that for autosomal population genetic data from diploid or polyploid highly fecund populations who may have skewed offspring distributions, one should not apply Lambda-coalescents, but Xi-coalescents."
10.1101/025668,"Soil fungal communities in tropical regions remain poorly understood. In order to increase the knowledge of diversity of soil-inhabiting fungi, we extracted total DNA from top-organic soil collected in seven localities dominated by four major ecosystems in the tropical island of Puerto Rico. In order to comprehensively characterize the fungal community, we PCR-amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) fungal barcode using newly designed degenerated primers and varying annealing temperatures to minimize primer bias. Sequencing results, obtained using Ion Torrent technology, comprised a total of 566,613 sequences after quality filtering. These sequences were clustered into 4,140 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) after removing low frequency sequences and rarefaction to account for differences in read depth between samples. Our results demonstrate that soil fungal communities in Puerto Rico are structured by ecosystem. Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, dominates the diversity of fungi in soil. Amongst Ascomycota, the recently described soil-inhabiting class Archaeorhizomycetes was present in all localities, and taxa in Archaeorhizomycetes were among the most commonly observed MOTUs. The Basidiomycota community was dominated by soil decomposers and ectomycorrhizal fungi with a distribution strongly affected by local variation to a greater degree than Ascomycota."
10.1101/025635,"Fluorescent protein tags have revolutionized cell and developmental biology, and in combination with binary expression systems they enable diverse tissue-specific studies of protein function. However these binary expression systems often do not recapitulate endogenous protein expression levels, localization, binding partners, and developmental windows of gene expression. To address these limitations, we have developed a method called T-STEP (Tissue-Specific Tagging of Endogenous Proteins) that allows endogenous loci to be tagged in a tissue specific manner. T-STEP uses a combination of efficient gene targeting and tissue-specific recombinase-mediated tag swapping to temporally and spatially label endogenous proteins. We have employed this method to GFP tag OCRL (a phosphoinositide-5-phosphatase in the endocytic pathway) and Vps35 (a Parkinson's disease-implicated component of the endosomal retromer complex) in diverse Drosophila tissues including neurons, glia, muscles, and hemocytes. Selective tagging of endogenous proteins allows for the first time cell type-specific live imaging and proteomics in complex tissues."
10.1101/025650,"Scaffolding is often an essential step in a genome assembly process, in which contigs are ordered and oriented using read pairs from a combination of paired-ends libraries and longer-range mate-pair libraries. Although a simple idea, scaffolding is unfortunately hard to get right in practice. One source of problem is so-called PE-contamination in mate-pair libraries, in which a non-negligible fraction of the read pairs get the wrong orientation and a much smaller insert size than what is expected. This contamination has been discussed in previous work on integrated scaffolders in end-to-end assemblers such as Allpaths-LG and MaSuRCA but the methods relies on the fact that the orientation is observable, e.g., by finding the junction adapter sequence in the reads. This is not always the case, making orientation and insert size of a read pair stochastic. Furthermore, work on modeling PE-contamination has so far been disregarded in stand-alone scaffolders and the effect that PE-contamination has on scaffolding quality has not been examined before.\n\nWe have addressed PE-contamination in an update of our scaffolder BESST. We formulate the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and use characteristics of the problem, such as contig lengths and insert size, to efficiently solve the ILP using a linear amount (with respect to the number of contigs) of Linear Programs. Our results show significant improvement over both integrated and standalone scaffolders. The impact of modeling PE-contamination is quantified by comparison with the previous BESST model. We also show how other scaffolders are vulnerable to PE-contaminated libraries, resulting in increased number of misassemblies, more conservative scaffolding, and inflated assembly sizes.\n\nThe model is implemented in BESST. Source code and usage instructions are found at https://github.com/ksahlin/BESST. BESST can also be downloaded using PyPI."
10.1101/025767,"RNA-seq technology is widely used in biomedical and basic science research. These studies rely on complex computational methods that quantify expression levels for observed transcripts. We find that current computational methods can lead to hundreds of false positive results related to alternative isoform usage. This flaw in the current methodology stems from a lack of modeling sample-specific bias that leads to drops in coverage and is related to sequence features like fragment GC content and GC stretches. By incorporating features that explain this bias into transcript expression models, we greatly increase the specificity of transcript expression estimates, with more than a four-fold reduction in the number of false positives for reported changes in expression. We introduce alpine, a method for estimation of bias-corrected transcript abundance. The method is available as a Bioconductor package that includes data visualization tools useful for bias discovery."
10.1101/025742,"O_LIRapid environmental change has generated growing interest in forecasts of future popu lation trajectories. Traditional population models built with detailed demographic obser vations from one study site can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations, but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales relevant to man agement decisions. An alternative is to build models using population-level data that are much easier to collect over broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown whether models built using population-level data adequately capture the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that are necessary to generate skillful forecasts.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we test the consequences of aggregating individual 29 responses when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana, USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment) and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their forecasting accuracy and fore cast horizons with and without the inclusion of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction.\nC_LIO_LIIn the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types.\nC_LIO_LIIn our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models based on aggregated individual level data may offer a practical alternative to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change.\nC_LI"
10.1101/025726,"Competitive exclusion and habitat filtering are believed to have an important influence on the assembly of ecological communities, but ecologists and evolutionary biologists have not reached a consensus on how to quantify patterns that would reveal the action of these processes. No fewer than 22 phylogenetic community structure metrics and nine null models can be combined, providing 198 approaches to test for such patterns. Choosing statistically appropriate approaches is currently a daunting task. First, given random community assembly, we assessed similarities among metrics and among null models in their behavior across communities varying in species richness. Second, we developed spatially explicit, individual-based simulations where communities were assembled either at random, by competitive exclusion or by habitat filtering. Third, we quantified the performance (type I and II error rates) of all 198 approaches against each of the three assembly processes. Many metrics and null models are functionally equivalent, more than halving the number of unique approaches. Moreover, an even smaller subset of metric and null model combinations is suitable for testing community assembly patterns. Metrics like mean pairwise phylogenetic distance and phylogenetic diversity were better able to detect simulated community assembly patterns than metrics like phylogenetic abundance evenness. A null model that simulates regional dispersal pressure on the community of interest outperformed all others. We introduce a flexible new R package, metricTester, to facilitate robust analyses of method performance. The package is programmed in parallel to readily accommodate integration of new row-wise matrix calculations (metrics) and matrix-wise randomizations (null models) to generate expectations and quantify error rates of proposed methods."
10.1101/025700,"BackgroundThe length of a protein sequence is largely determined by its function, i.e. each functional group is associated with an optimal size. However, comparative genomics revealed that proteins length may be affected by additional factors. In 2002 it was shown that in bacterium Escherichia coli and the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences with no homologs are, on average, shorter than those with homologs [1]. Most experts now agree that the length distributions are distinctly different between protein sequences with and without homologs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. In this study, we examine this postulate by a comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic genomes and focusing on certain exceptions.\n\nResultsWe compared lengths distributions of \""having homologs proteins\"" (HHPs) and \""non-having homologs proteins\"" (orphans or ORFans) in all currently annotated completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As expected, the HHPs and ORFans have strikingly different length distributions in almost all genomes. As previously established, the HHPs, indeed, are, on average, longer than the ORFans, and the length distributions for the ORFans have a relatively narrow peak, in contrast to the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a wider range of values. However, about thirty genomes do not obey these rules. Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans distributions, with the mean lengths of ORFan larger than the mean lengths of HHPs. These genera constitute over 80% of atypical genomes.\n\nConclusionsWe confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes the previous observation that HHPs and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We also showed that Mycoplasmataceae genomes have very distinctive distributions of ORFans lengths. We offer several possible biological explanations of this phenomenon."
10.1101/025809,"The Bene Israel Jewish community from West India is a unique population whose history before the 18th century remains largely unknown. Bene Israel members consider themselves as descendants of Jews, yet the identity of Jewish ancestors and their arrival time to India are unknown, with speculations on arrival time varying between the 8th century BCE and the 6th century CE. Here, we characterize the genetic history of Bene Israel by collecting and genotyping 18 Bene Israel individuals. Combining with 486 individuals from 41 other Jewish, Indian and Pakistani populations, and additional individuals from worldwide populations, we conducted comprehensive genome-wide analyses based on FST, principal component analysis, ADMIXTURE, identity-by-descent sharing, admixture linkage disequilibrium decay, haplotype sharing and allele sharing autocorrelation decay, as well as contrasted patterns between the X chromosome and the autosomes. The genetics of Bene Israel individuals resemble local Indian populations, while at the same time constituting a clearly separated and unique population in India. They are unique among Indian and Pakistani populations we analyzed in sharing considerable genetic ancestry with other Jewish populations. Putting together the results from all analyses point to Bene Israel being an admixed population with both Jewish and Indian ancestry, with the genetic contribution of each of these ancestral populations being substantial. The admixture took place in the last millennium, about 19-33 generations ago. It involved Middle-Eastern Jews and was sex-biased, with more male Jewish and local female contribution. It was followed by a population bottleneck and high endogamy, which can lead to increased prevalence of recessive diseases in this population. This study provides an example of how genetic analysis advances our knowledge of human history in cases where other disciplines lack the relevant data to do so."
10.1101/025791,"We identified and characterized a free PRE-1 element inserted into the promoter region of the porcine IGFBP7 gene whose integration mechanisms into the genome, including copy number, distribution preferences, capacity to exonize and phyloclustering pattern are similar to that of the primate Alu element. 98% of these PRE-1 elements also contain two conserved internal AluI restriction enzyme recognition sites, and the RNA structure of PRE1 can be folded into a two arms model like the Alu RNA structure. It is more surprising that the length of the PRE-1 fragments is nearly the same in 20 chromosomes and positively correlated to its fracture site frequency. All of these fracture sites are close to the mutation hot spots of PRE-1 families, and most of these hot spots are located in the non-complementary fragile regions of the PRE-1 RNA structure. Sequence homology analysis showed that the PRE-1 element seemed to share a common ancestor 7SL RNA with primates but was generated by different evolutionary model, which suggests that the suidae may be the closest relatives to primates in laurasiatheria."
10.1101/025817,"In the present change blindness study subjects explored stereoscopic three dimensional (3D) environments through a virtual reality (VR) headset. A novel method that tracked the subjects head movements was used for inducing changes in the scene whenever the changing object was out of the field of view. The effect of change location (foreground or background in 3D depth) on change blindness was investigated. Two experiments were conducted, one in the lab (n = 50) and the other online (n = 25). Up to 25% of the changes were undetected and the mean overall search time was 27 seconds in the lab study. Results indicated significantly lower change detection success and more change cycles if the changes occurred in the background, with no differences in overall search times. The results confirm findings from previous studies and extend them to 3D environments. The study also demonstrates the feasibility of online VR experiments."
10.1101/025833,"There is a gradual change towards explicitly considering landscapes in regulatory risk assessment. To realise the objective of developing representative scenarios for risk assessment it is necessary to know how detailed a landscape representation is needed to generate a realistic risk assessment, and indeed how to generate such landscapes. This paper evaluates the contribution of landscape and farming components to a model based risk assessment of a fictitious endocrine disruptor on hares. In addition, we present methods and code examples for generation of landscape structures and farming simulation from data collected primarily for EU agricultural subsidy support and GIS map data.\n\nTen different Danish landscapes were generated and the ERA carried out for each landscape using two different assumed toxicities. The results showed negative impacts in all cases, but the extent and form in terms of impacts on abundance or occupancy differed greatly between landscapes. A meta-model was created, predicting impact from landscape and farming characteristics. Scenarios based on all combinations of farming and landscape for five landscapes representing extreme and middle impacts were created. The meta-models developed from the 10 real landscapes failed to predict impacts for these 25 scenarios. Landscape, farming, and the emergent density of hares all influenced the results of the risk assessment considerably.\n\nThe study indicates that prediction of a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult from structural, farming or population metrics; rather the emergent properties generated from interactions between landscape, management and ecology are needed. Meta-modelling may also fail to predict impacts, even when restricting inputs to combinations of those used to create the model. Future ERA may therefore need to make use of multiple scenarios representing a wide range of conditions to avoid locally unacceptable risks. This approach could now be feasible Europe wide given the landscape generation methods presented."
10.1101/024422,"AbstractDuring the last 50 years, comparative cognition and neurosciences have improved our understanding of animal minds while evolutionary ecology has revealed how selection acts on traits through evolutionary time. We describe how this evolutionary approach can be used to understand the evolution of animal cognition. We recount how comparative and fitness methods have been used to understand the evolution of cognition and outline how these methods could be extended to gain new insights into cognitive evolution. The fitness approach, in particular, offers unprecedented opportunities to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in cognition within species and could allow us to investigate both proximate (ie: neural and developmental) and ultimate (ie: ecological and evolutionary) underpinnings of animal cognition together. Our goal in this review is to build a bridge between cognitive neuroscientist and evolutionary biologists, illustrate how their research could be complementary, and encourage evolutionary ecologists to include explicit attention to cognitive processes in their studies of behaviour. We believe that in doing so, we can break new ground in our understanding of the evolution of cognition as well as gain a much better understanding of animal behaviour."

Within minutes, Teaser completes a quantitative evaluation of an ensemble of mapping algorithms and parameters. Using Teaser, we demonstrate how Bowtie2 can be optimized for different data."
10.1101/025908,"One sentence summaryIn silico decomposition of the immune microenvironment among common tumor types identified clear cell renal cell carcinoma as the most highly infiltrated by T-cells and further analysis of this tumor type revealed three distinct and clinically relevant clusters which were validated in an independent cohort.\n\nAbstractInfiltrating T cells in the tumor microenvironment have crucial roles in the competing processes of pro-tumor and anti-tumor immune response. However, the infiltration level of distinct T cell subsets and the signals that draw them into a tumor, such as the expression of antigen presenting machinery (APM) genes, remain poorly characterized across human cancers. Here, we define a novel mRNA-based T cell infiltration score (TIS) and profile infiltration levels in 19 tumor types. We find that clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the highest for TIS and among the highest for the correlation between TIS and APM expression, despite a modest mutation burden. This finding is contrary to the expectation that immune infiltration and mutation burden are linked. To further characterize the immune infiltration in ccRCC, we use RNA-seq data to computationally infer the infiltration levels of 24 immune cell types in a discovery cohort of 415 ccRCC patients and validate our findings in an independent cohort of 101 ccRCC patients. We find three clusters of tumors that are primarily separated by levels of T cell infiltration and APM gene expression. In ccRCC, the levels of Th17 cells and the ratio of CD8+ T/Treg levels are associated with improved survival whereas the levels of Th2 cells and Tregs are associated with negative clinical outcome. Our analysis illustrates the utility of computational immune cell decomposition for solid tumors, and the potential of this method to guide clinical decision-making."
10.1101/025882,"Axial elongation is a widespread mechanism propelling the generation of the metazoan body plan. A widely accepted model is that of posterior growth, where new tissue is continually added from the posterior unsegmented tip of the body axis. A key question is whether or not such a posterior growth zone generates sufficient additional tissue volume to generate elongation of the body axis, and the degree to which this is balanced with tissue convergence and/or growth in already segmented regions of the body axis. We applied a multi-scalar morphometric analysis during posterior axis elongation in zebrafish. Importantly, by labelling of specific regions/tissues and tracking their deformation, we observed that the unsegmented region does not generate additional tissue volume at the caudal tip. Instead, it contributes to axis elongation by extensive tissue deformation at constant volume. We show that volumetric growth occurs in the segmented portion of the axis and can be attributed to an increase in the size and length of the spinal cord and notochord. FGF inhibition blocks tissue convergence within the tailbud and unsegmented region rather than affecting volumetric growth, showing that a conserved molecular mechanism can control convergent morphogenesis, even if by different cell behaviours. Finally, a comparative morphometric analysis in lamprey, dogfish, zebrafish and mouse reveal a differential contribution of volumetric growth that is linked to a switch between external and internal modes of development. We propose that posterior growth is not a conserved mechanism to drive axis elongation in vertebrates. It is instead associated with an overall increase in growth characteristic of internally developing embryos that undergo embryonic development concomitantly with an increase in energy supply from the female parent."

Interactions are just pairwise relationships among individuals of two different species, such as those among plants and their seed dispersers in frugivory interactions or those among plants and their pollinators. Sampling interactions is a fundamental step to build robustly estimated interaction networks, yet few analyses have attempted a formal approach to their sampling protocols.\nC_LIO_LIRobust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions.\nC_LIO_LIWhile the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizable fraction of the maximum number of interactions Imax among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e., Imax = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, i.e., life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I << Imax, resulting in extremely sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.\nC_LIO_LIReasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches, and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Ad-equately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that for-bidden links can be \""discounted\"" when addressing sampling effort.\nC_LIO_LIHere I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. This is crucial to assess the fast-paced and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.\nC_LI"
10.1101/025866,"The process of domestication leads to major morphological and genetic changes, which in combination are known as domestication syndrome that differentiates crops from their wild ancestors. We characterized the genomic and phenotypic diversity of the South American grain amaranth Amaranthus caudatus, which has been cultivated for thousands of years and is one of the three native grain amaranths of South and Central America. Previously, several models of domestication were proposed including a domestication from the close relatives and putative ancestors A. hybridus or A. quitensis. To investigate the evolutionary relationship of A. caudatus and its two close relatives, we genotyped 119 amaranth accessions of the three species from the Andean region using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and compared phenotypic variation in two domestication-related traits, seed size and seed color. The analysis of 9,485 SNPs revealed a strong genetic differentiation of cultivated A. caudatus from the relatives A. hybridus and A. quitensis. The two relatives did not cluster according to the species assigment but formed mixed groups according to their geographic origin in Ecuador and Peru, respectively. A. caudatus had a higher genetic diversity than its close relatives and shared a high proportion of polymorphisms with their wild relatives consistent with the absence of a strong bottleneck or a high level of recent gene flow. Genome sizes and seed sizes were not significantly different between A. caudatus and its relatives, although a genetically distinct group of A. caudatus from Bolivia had significantly larger seeds. We conclude that despite a long history of human cultivation and selection for white grain color, A. caudatus shows a weak genomic and phenotypic domestication syndrome and is an incompletely domesticated species because of weak selection or high levels of gene flow from its sympatric close undomesticated relatives that counteracted the fixation of key domestication traits."

Aberrant cleavage of Notch is implicated in cancer, while abnormalities in cutting amyloid precursor protein lead to Alzheimers disease. Our previous cryo-EM structure of {gamma}-secretase revealed considerable disorder in its catalytic subunit presenilin. Here, we introduce an image classification procedure that characterizes molecular plasticity at the secondary structure level, and apply this method to identify three distinct conformations in our previous sample. In one of these conformations, an additional transmembrane helix is visible that cannot be attributed to the known components of {gamma}-secretase. In addition, we present a {gamma}-secretase structure in complex with the dipeptidic inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT).

10.1101/025841,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a central role in bacterial evolution, yet the molecular and cellular constraints on functional integration of the foreign genes are poorly understood. Here we performed inter-species replacement of the chromosomal folA gene, encoding an essential metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), with orthologs from 35 other mesophilic bacteria. The orthologous inter-species replacements caused a marked drop (in the range 10-90%) in bacterial growth rate despite the fact that most orthologous DHFRs are as stable as E.coli DHFR at 37{degrees} C and are more catalytically active than E. coli DHFR. Although phylogenetic distance between E. coli and orthologous DHFRs as well as their individual molecular properties correlate poorly with growth rates, the product of the intracellular DHFR abundance and catalytic activity (kcat/KM), correlates strongly with growth rates, indicating that the drop in DHFR abundance constitutes the major fitness barrier to HGT. Serial propagation of the orthologous strains for [~]600 generations dramatically improved growth rates by largely alleviating the fitness barriers. Whole genome sequencing and global proteome quantification revealed that the evolved strains with the largest fitness improvements have accumulated mutations that inactivated the ATP-dependent Lon protease, causing an increase in the intracellular DHFR abundance. In one case DHFR abundance increased further due to mutations accumulated in folA promoter, but only after the lon inactivating mutations were fixed in the population. Thus, by apparently distinguishing between self and non-self proteins, protein homeostasis imposes an immediate and global barrier to the functional integration of foreign genes by decreasing the intracellular abundance of their products. Once this barrier is alleviated, more fine-tuned evolution occurs to adjust the function/expression of the transferred proteins to the constraints imposed by the intracellular environment of the host organism."
10.1101/025916,"Bluegill sunfish are one of the classic systems for studying male alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in teleost fishes. In this species, there are two distinct life histories: parental and cuckolder, encompassing three reproductive tactics, parental, satellite, and sneaker. The parental life history is fixed, whereas individuals who enter the cuckolder life history transition from the sneaker to the satellite tactic as they grow. For this study, we used RNAseq to characterize the brain transcriptome of the three male tactics and females during spawning to identify gene categories associated with each tactic and identify potential candidate genes influencing their different spawning behaviors. We found that sneaker males had higher levels of gene differentiation compared to the other two male tactics. Sneaker males also had high expression in ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, specifically AMPA receptors, which may be important for increased working spatial memory while attempting to cuckold parental males at their nests. Larger differences in gene expression also occurred among male tactics than between males and females. We found significant expression differences in several candidate genes that were previously identified in other species with ARTs and suggest a previously undescribed role for cAMP-responsive element modulator (crem) in influencing parental male behaviors during spawning."
10.1101/025940,"The fossil record is a rich source of information about biological diversity in the past. However, the fossil record is not only incomplete but has inherent biases due to geological, physical, chemical and biological factors. Our knowledge of past life is also biased because of differences in academic and amateur interests and sampling efforts. As a result, not all individuals or species that lived in the past are equally likely to be discovered at any point in time or space. To reconstruct temporal dynamics of diversity using the fossil record, biased sampling must be explicitly taken into account. Here, we introduce an approach that utilizes the variation in the number of times each species is observed in the fossil record to estimate both sampling bias and true richness. We term our technique TRiPS (True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model) and explore its robustness to violation of its assumptions via simulations. We then venture to estimate sampling bias and absolute species richness of dinosaurs in the geological stages of the Mesozoic. Using TRiPS, we estimate that 1936 (1543-2468) species of dinosaurs roamed the Earth during the Mesozoic. We also present improved estimates of species richness trajectories of the three major dinosaur clades; the sauropodomorphs, ornithischians and theropods, casting doubt on the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event and demonstrating that all dinosaur groups are subject to considerable sampling bias throughout the Mesozoic."
10.1101/026005,"Experimental measurements require calibration to transform measured signals into physically meaningful values. The conventional approach has two steps: the experimenter deduces a conversion function using measurements on standards and then calibrates (or normalizes) measurements on unknown samples with this function. The deduction of the conversion function from only the standard measurements causes the results to be quite sensitive to experimental noise. It also implies that any data collected without reliable standards must be discarded. Here we show that a new \""1-step calibration method\"" reduces these problems for the common situation in which samples are measured in batches, where a batch could be an immunoblot (Western blot), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a sequence of spectra, or a microarray, provided that some sample measurements are replicated across multiple batches. The 1-step method computes all calibration results iteratively from all measurements. It returns the most probable values for the sample compositions under the assumptions of a statistical model, making them the maximum likelihood predictors. It is less sensitive to measurement error on standards and enables use of some batches that do not include standards. In direct comparison of both real and simulated immunoblot data, the 1-step method consistently exhibited smaller errors than the conventional \""2-step\"" method. These results suggest that the 1-step method is likely to be most useful for cases where experimenters want to analyze existing data that are missing some standard measurements and where experimenters want to extract the best results possible from their data. Simple open source software for both methods is available for download or on-line use.\n\nAuthor SummaryMost quantitative measurements do not return the physical quantities that are of interest, but some instrument-specific response value instead. These measurements are then converted to physical quantities through a conversion function, which the experimenter deduces from instrument responses for one or more standard samples of known composition. This is called calibration or normalization. For example, we recently performed quantitative immunoblotting on a large number of samples, each replicated on multiple blots, and then calibrated the measurements to yield protein concentrations relative to those in a standard sample. We found that the conventional calibration approach of treating the samples in each blot independently of the samples in other blots produced inaccurate results because this approach is completely dependent on the standard measurements, which were sometimes missing or erroneous in our data. Thus, we developed a new calibration approach in which we fit a statistical model to the entire data set simultaneously. This method, which applies to a very wide range of calibration problems, was substantially more accurate during validation tests and can be shown to return the most accurate results possible within the assumptions of the model. It is particularly useful when some standard measurements are missing from data sets or when experimenters want the best possible results."
10.1101/025999,"MotivationDeveloping targeted therapeutics and identifying biomarkers relies on large amounts of patient data. Beyond human DNA, researchers now investigate the DNA of micro-organisms inhabiting the human body. An individuals collection of microbial DNA consistently identifies that person and could be used to link a real-world identity to a sensitive attribute in a research dataset. Unfortunately, the current suite of DNA-specific privacy-preserving analysis tools does not meet the requirements for microbiome sequencing studies.\n\nResultsWe augment an existing categorization of genomic-privacy attacks to incorporate microbiome sequencing and provide an implementation of metagenomic analyses using secure computation. Our implementation allows researchers to perform analysis over combined data without revealing individual patient attributes. We implement three metagenomic analyses and perform an evaluation on real datasets for comparative analysis. We use our implementation to simulate sharing data between four policy-domains and measure the increase in significant discoveries. Additionally, we describe an application of our implementation to form patient pools of data to allow drug companies to query against and compensate patients for the analysis.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is freely available for download at: http://cbcb.umd.edu/[~]hcorrada/projects/secureseq.html"
10.1101/025957,"The extent of within-species genetic variation across the diversity of animal life is a fundamental but largely unexplored problem in ecology and evolution. The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that genetic variation scales positively with population size. However, the genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA, a prominent marker used in DNA barcoding studies, shows very little variation across animal species. Here, we report an unprecedented case of extreme mitochondrial variation within natural populations of two species of chaetognaths (arrow worms). We determined that this diversity is composed of deep intraspecific mitochondrial lineages within single populations that could be as divergent as human and newt. This mitochondrial diversity is the highest ever reported in animals without evidence of cryptic speciation or allopatric divergence as supported by nuclear evidence. We sequenced 54 complete mitogenomes revealing gene order rearrangements between these intraspecific lineages. Such structural differences have never previously been reported within single species. We confirm that this divergence was not driven by positive selection, and conversely show that these lineages evolved under purifying selection, consistently with neutral expectations. Our findings question the generally accepted narrow range of genetic variation in animal mitochondria and argue for a reappraisal of DNA barcoding techniques. Furthermore, extreme levels of mitogenomic variation in chaetognaths challenge classical views regarding mitochondrial evolution and cytonuclear co-evolution."
10.1101/025973,"The conservation of threatened species must be underpinned by phylogeographic knowledge in order to be effective. This need is epitomised by the freshwater fish Carassius carassius, which has recently undergone drastic declines across much of its European range. Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is being increasingly used for such phylogeographic questions, however RADseq is expensive, and limitations on sample number must be weighed against the benefit of large numbers of markers. Such tradeoffs have predominantly been addressed using simulated data. Here we compare the results generated from microsatellites and RADseq to the phylogeography of C. carassius, to add real-data-informed perspectives to this important debate. These datasets, along with data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, agree on broad phylogeographic patterns; showing the existence of two previously unidentified C. carassius lineages in Europe. These lineages have been isolated for approximately 2.2-2.3 M years, and should arguably be considered as separate conservation units. RADseq recovered finer population structure and stronger patterns of IBD than microsatellites, despite including only 17.6% of samples (38% of populations and 52% of samples per population). RADseq was also used along with Approximate Bayesian Computation to show that the postglacial colonisation routes of C. carassius differ from the general patterns of freshwater fish in Europe, likely as a result of their distinctive ecology."
10.1101/025981,"Adaptation of pest species to laboratory conditions and selection for resistance to toxins in the laboratory are expected to cause inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Heliothis virescens, a major cotton pest, has been colonized in the laboratory many times, and a few laboratory colonies have been selected for Bt resistance. We developed 350 bp Double-Digest Restriction-site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) molecular markers to examine and compare changes in genetic variation associated with laboratory adaptation, artificial selection, and inbreeding in this non-model insect species. We found that allelic and nucleotide diversity declined dramatically in laboratory-reared H. virescens as compared with field-collected populations. The declines were primarily due to the loss of low frequency alleles present in field-collected H. virescens. A further, albeit modest decline in genetic diversity was observed in a Bt-selected population. The greatest decline was seen in H. virescens that were sib-mated for 10 generations, where more than 80% of loci were fixed for a single allele. To determine which regions of the genome were resistant to fixation in our sib-mated line, we generated a dense intraspecific linkage map containing 3 PCR-based, and 659 ddRAD-seq markers. Markers that retained polymorphism were observed in small clusters spread over multiple linkage groups, but this clustering was not statistically significant. Here, we confirmed and extended the general expectations for reduced genetic diversity in laboratory colonies, provided tools for further genomic analyses, and produced highly homozygous genomic DNA for future whole genome sequencing of H. virescens."
10.1101/025924,"SummaryOne gene can produce multiple transcript variants encoding proteins with different functions. To facilitate visual analysis of transcript variants, we developed ProtAnnot, which shows protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence. ProtAnnot searches InterPro and displays profile matches (protein annotations) alongside gene models, exposing how alternative promoters, splicing, and 3 end processing add, remove, or remodel functional motifs. To draw attention to these effects, ProtAnnot color-codes exons by frame and displays a cityscape graphic summarizing exonic sequence at each position. These techniques make visual analysis of alternative transcripts faster and more convenient for biologists.

10.1101/026062,"As RNA-Seq and other high-throughput sequencing grow in use and remain critical for gene expression studies, technical variability in counts data impedes studies of differential expression studies, data across samples and experiments, or reproducing results. Studies like Dillies et al. (2013) compare several between-lane normalization methods involving scaling factors, while Hansen et al. (2012) and Risso et al. (2014) propose methods that correct for sample-specific bias or use sets of control genes to isolate and remove technical variability. This paper evaluates four normalization methods in terms of reducing intra-group, technical variability and facilitating differential expression analysis or other research where the biological, inter-group variability is of interest. To this end, the four methods were evaluated in differential expression analysis between data from Pickrell et al. (2010) and Montgomery et al. (2010) and between simulated data modeled on these two datasets. Though the between-lane scaling factor methods perform worse on real data sets, they are much stronger for simulated data. We cannot reject the recommendation of Dillies et al. to use TMM and DESeq normalization, but further study of power to detect effects of different size under each normalization method is merited."
10.1101/026088,"A fundamental consideration for the conservation of a species is the extent of its native range, however defining a native range is often challenging as changing environments drive shifts in species distributions over time. The crucian carp, Carassius carassius (L.) is a threatened freshwater fish native to much of Europe, however the extent of this range is ambiguous. One particularly contentious region is England, in which C. carassius is currently considered native on the basis of anecdotal evidence. Here, we use 13 microsatellite loci, population structure analyses and approximate bayesian computation (ABC), to empirically test the native status of C. carassius in England. Contrary to the current consensus, ABC yields strong support for introduced origins of C. carassius in England, with posterior distribution estimates placing their introduction in the 15th century, well after the loss of the doggerland landbridge. This result brings to light an interesting and timely debate surrounding our motivations for the conservation of species. We discuss this topic, and make arguments for the continued conservation of C. carassius in England, despite its non-native origins."
10.1101/026039,"After heat shock injury, a group of proteins that regulate protein-folding processes are synthesised to prevent damage. Caspase is an enzyme responsible for the execution ostress-induced apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are capable of modulating caspase activity. In addition to changes in protein synthesis, heat shock causes the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from plasma membranes and the subsequent synthesis of eicosanoids, i.e., activation of the AA pathways. The development of cytoprotective strategies might depend on whether caspase-1 activity is affected by heat shock preconditioning and the associated pharmacological modulations after heat shock injury. Therefore, we studied the effects of heat shock preconditioning and modulations of the eicosanoid pathways on Ap-sHSP20.8 and on the final apoptotic effector enzyme caspase-1 to clarify whether these effects were modulated in the fat bodies of Antheraea pernyi injured by heat shock. We concluded that eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors might be utilised to simultaneously decrease Hsp 20.8 synthesis and to increase caspase-1 activity. Modifications of the eicosanoid pathways might also be used to mediate caspase-1 activity under hyperthermic conditions, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulation of caspase-1 in the fat bodies of A. pernyi"
10.1101/026112,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative agent of chronic respiratory infections and is an important pathogen of cystic fibrosis patients. Adaptive mutations play an essential role for antimicrobial resistance and persistence. The factors that contribute to bacterial mutagenesis in this environment are not clear. Recently it has been proposed that cationic antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 could act as a mutagen in P. aeruginosa. Here we provide experimental evidence that mutagenesis is the product of a joint action of LL-37 and free iron. By estimating mutation rate, mutant frequencies and assessing mutational spectra in P. aeruginosa treated either with LL-37, iron or a combination of both we demonstrate that mutation rate and mutant frequency were increased only when free iron and LL-37 were present simultaneously. The addition of an iron chelator completely abolished this mutagenic effect, suggesting that LL-37 enables iron to enter the cells resulting in DNA damage by Fenton reactions. This was also supported by the observation that the mutational spectrum of the bacteria under LL-37-iron regime showed one of the characteristic Fenton reaction fingerprints: C to T transitions. Free iron concentration in nature and within hosts is kept at a very low level, but the situation in infected lungs of cystic fibrosis patients is different. Intermittent bleeding and damage to the epithelial cells in lungs may contribute to the release of free iron that in turn leads to generation of reactive oxygen species and deterioration of the respiratory tract, making it more susceptible to the infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryCationic antimicrobial peptides (cAMPs) are small proteins naturally produced by the immune system to limit bacterial growth mainly through pore formation in the membrane. It has recently been suggested that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs promote bacterial mutagenesis, similarly to antibiotics. However, we previously reported that cAMPs do not increase mutation rate and do not activate bacterial stress responses. Here we resolve this contradiction. We report that free iron in the culture medium increases mutagenesis in the presence of cAMPs. We show that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs facilitate entry of free iron into bacterial cells, where it interacts with hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species and increased mutagenesis. Moreover, these results may have clinically-relevant implications: while very little free iron is normally present in healthy individuals, this is not the case in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, where elevated bacterial mutagenesis promotes antibiotic resistance and contributes to persistence and severity of infection. Thus, an intervention aimed at reduction of free iron in the lungs could reduce the cAMPs-facilitation of iron-mediated mutagenesis; hence antibiotic resistance and pathoadaptation."
10.1101/026120,"The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection, and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population-specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output to data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance."
10.1101/026013,"Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate chromatin states, but the evolutionary origin and dynamics driving lncRNA-genome interactions are unclear. We developed an integrative strategy that identifies lncRNA orthologs in different species despite limited sequence similarity that is applicable to fly and mammalian lncRNAs. Analysis of the roX lncRNAs, which are essential for dosage compensation of the single X-chromosome in Drosophila males, revealed 47 new roX orthologs in diverse Drosophilid species across ~40 million years of evolution. Genetic rescue by roX orthologs and engineered synthetic lncRNAs showed that evolutionary maintenance of focal structural repeats mediates roX function. Genomic occupancy maps of roX RNAs in four species revealed rapid turnover of individual binding sites but conservation within nearby chromosomal neighborhoods. Many new roX binding sites evolved from DNA encoding a pre-existing RNA splicing signal, effectively linking dosage compensation to transcribed genes. Thus, evolutionary analysis illuminates the principles for the birth and death of lncRNAs and their genomic targets."
10.1101/026021,"Forest trees generally show high levels of local adaptation and efforts focusing on understanding adaptation to climate will be crucial for species survival and management.\n\nMerging quantitative genetics and population genomics, we studied the molecular basis of climate adaptation in 433 Populus trichocarpa (black cottonwood) genotypes originating across western North America. Variation in 74 field-assessed traits (growth, ecophysiology, phenology, leaf stomata, wood, and disease resistance) was investigated for signatures of selection (comparing QST-FST) using clustering of individuals by climate of origin. 29,354 SNPs were investigated employing three different outlier detection methods.\n\nNarrow-sense QST for 53% of distinct field QST traits was significantly divergent from expectations of neutrality (indicating adaptive trait variation); 2,855 SNPs showed signals of diversifying selection and of these, 118 SNPs (within 81 genes) were associated with adaptive traits (based on significant QST). Many SNPs were putatively pleiotropic for functionally uncorrelated adaptive traits, such as autumn phenology, height, and disease resistance.\n\nEvolutionary quantitative genomics in P. trichocarpa provides an enhanced understanding regarding the molecular basis of climate-driven selection in forest trees. We highlight that important loci underlying adaptive trait variation also show relationship to climate of origin.\n\nAuthor summaryComparisons between population differentiation on the basis of quantitative traits and neutral genetic markers inform about the importance of natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow for local adaptation of populations. Here, we address fundamental questions regarding the molecular basis of adaptation in undomesticated forest tree populations to past climatic environments by employing an integrative quantitative genetics and landscape genomics approach. Marker-inferred relatedness was estimated to obtain the narrow-sense estimate of population differentiation in wild populations. We analyzed an unstructured population of common garden grown Populus trichocarpa individuals to uncover different extents of variation for a suite of field traits, wood quality and pathogen resistance with temperature and precipitation. We consider our approach the most comprehensive, as it uncovers the molecular mechanisms of adaptation using multiple methods and tests. We provide a detailed outline of the required analyses for studying adaptation to the environment in a population genomics context to better understand the species potential adaptive capacity to future climatic scenarios."
10.1101/026070,"DNA double-strand breaks are lesions that form during metabolism, DNA replication and exposure to mutagens. When a double-strand break occurs one of a number of repair mechanisms is recruited, all of which have differing propensities for mutational events. Despite DNA repair being of crucial importance, the relative contribution of these mechanisms and their regulatory interactions remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding these mutational processes will have a profound impact on our knowledge of genomic instability, with implications across health, disease and evolution. Here we present a new method to model the combined activation of non-homologous end joining, single strand annealing and alternative end joining, following exposure to ionizing radiation. We use Bayesian statistics to integrate eight biological data sets of double-strand break repair curves under varying genetic knockouts and confirm that our model is predictive by re-simulating and comparing to additional data. Analysis of the model suggests that there are at least three disjoint modes of repair, which we assign as fast, slow and intermediate. Our results show that when multiple data sets are combined, the rate for intermediate repair is variable amongst genetic knockouts. Further analysis suggests that the ratio between slow and intermediate repair depends on the presence or absence of DNA-PKcs and Ku70, which implies that non-homologous end joining and alternative end joining are not independent. Finally, we consider the proportion of double-strand breaks within each mechanism as a time series and predict activity as a function of repair rate. We outline how our insights can be directly tested using imaging and sequencing techniques and conclude that there is evidence of variable dynamics in alternative repair pathways. Our approach is an important step towards providing a unifying theoretical framework for the dynamics of DNA repair processes."
10.1101/026153,"BackgroundIn 2012, two large pharmacogenomic studies, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), were published, each reported gene expression data and measures of drug response for a large number of drugs and hundreds of cell lines. In 2013, we published a comparative analysis that reported gene expression profiles for the 471 cell lines profiled in both studies and dose response measurements for the 15 drugs characterized in the common cell lines by both studies. While we found good concordance in gene expression profiles, there was substantial inconsistency in the drug responses reported by the GDSC and CCLE projects. Our paper was widely discussed and we received extensive feedback on the comparisons that we performed. This feedback, along with the release of new data, prompted us to revisit our initial analysis. Here we present a new analysis using these expanded data in which we address the most significant suggestions for improvements on our published analysis: that drugs with different response characteristics should have been treated differently, that targeted therapies and broad cytotoxic drugs should have been treated differently in assessing consistency, that consistency of both molecular profiles and drug sensitivity measurements should both be compared across cell lines to accurately assess differences in the studies, that we missed some biomarkers that are consistent between studies, and that the software analysis tools we provided with our analysis should have been easier to run, particularly as the GDSC and CCLE released additional data.\n\nMethodsFor each drug, we used published sensitivity data from the GDSC and CCLE to separately estimate drug dose-response curves. We then used two statistics, the area between drug dose-response curves (ABC) and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), to robustly estimate the consistency of continuous and discrete drug sensitivity measures, respectively. We also used recently released RNA-seq data together with previously published gene expression microarray data to assess inter-platform reproducibility of cell line gene expression profiles.\n\nResultsThis re-analysis supports our previous finding that gene expression data are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity measurements. The use of new statistics to assess data consistency allowed us to identify two broad effect drugs -- 17-AAG and PD-0332901 -- and three targeted drugs -- PLX4720, nilotinib and crizotinib -- with moderate to good consistency in drug sensitivity data between GDSC and CCLE. Not enough sensitive cell lines were screened in both studies to robustly assess consistency for three other targeted drugs, PHA-665752, erlotinib, and sorafenib. Concurring with our published results, we found evidence of inconsistencies in pharmacological phenotypes for the remaining eight drugs. Further, to discover \""consistency\"" between studies required the use of multiple statistics and the selection of specific measures on a case-by-case basis.\n\nConclusionOur results reaffirm our initial findings of an inconsistency in drug sensitivity measures for eight of fifteen drugs screened both in GDSC and CCLE, irrespective of which statistical metric was used to assess correlation. Taken together, our findings suggest that the phenotypic data on drug response in the GDSC and CCLE continue to present challenges for robust biomarker discovery. This re-analysis provides additional support for the argument that experimental standardization and validation of pharmacogenomic response will be necessary to advance the broad use of large pharmacogenomic screens."
10.1101/026203,"Viruses are the simplest replicating units, characterized by a limited number of coding genes and an exceptionally high rate of overlapping genes. We sought a unified explanation for the evolutionary constraints that govern genome sizes, gene overlapping and capsid properties. We performed an unbiased statistical analysis over the [~]100 known viral families, and came to refute widespread assumptions regarding viral evolution. We found that the volume utilization of viral capsids is often low, and greatly varies among families. Most notably, we show that the total amount of gene overlapping is tightly bounded. Although viruses expand three orders of magnitude in genome length, their absolute amount of gene overlapping almost never exceeds 1500 nucleotides, and mostly confined to <4 significant overlapping instances. Our results argue against the common theory by which gene overlapping is driven by a necessity of viruses to compress their genome. Instead, we support the notion that overlapping has a role in gene novelty and evolution exploration."
10.1101/026146,"In outcrossing populations, \""Haldanes Sieve\"" states that recessive beneficial alleles are less likely to fix than dominant ones, because they are less expose to selection when rare. In contrast, selfing organisms are not subject to Haldanes Sieve and are more likely to fix recessive types than outcrossers, as selfing rapidly creates homozygotes, increasing overall selection acting on mutations. However, longer homozygous tracts in selfers also reduces the ability of recombination to create new genotypes. It is unclear how these two effects influence overall adaptation rates in partially selfing organisms. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles if there is an existing selective sweep in the population. We consider both the potential loss of the second beneficial mutation if it has a weaker advantage than the first, and the possible replacement of the initial allele if the second mutant is fitter. Overall, loss of weaker adaptive alleles during a first selective sweep has a larger impact on preventing fixation of both mutations in highly selfing organisms. Furthermore, the presence of linked mutations has two opposing effects on Haldanes Sieve. First, recessive mutants are disproportionally likely to be lost in outcrossers, so it is likelier that dominant mutations will fix. Second, with elevated rates of adaptive mutation, selective interference annuls the advantage in selfing organisms of not suffering from Haldanes Sieve; outcrossing organisms are more able to fix weak beneficial mutations of any dominance value. Overall, weakened recombination effects can greatly limit adaptation in selfing organisms."
10.1101/026195,"Hfq is the bacterial orthologue of the eukaryotic (L)Sm family of proteins found across all domains of life and potentially an ancient protein, but it has not been found in all phyletic lines. A careful search successfully identified a distant hfq orthologue in the cyanobacteria leaving the actinobacteria as the major phylum with no known hfq orthologue. A search for hfq in actinobacteria, using domain enhanced searching (DELTA-BLAST) with cyanobacterial hfq, identified a conserved actinobacterial specific protein as remotely homologous. Structural homology modelling using profile matching to fold libraries and ab initio 3D structure determination supports this prediction and suggests module shuffling in the evolution of the actinobacterial hfq. Our results provide the basis to explore this prediction, and exploit it, across diverse taxa with potentially important post-transcriptional regulatory effects in virulence, antibiotic production and interactions in human microbiomes. However, the role of hfq in gram positive bacteria has remained elusive and experimental verification will be challenging."
10.1101/026229,"Embryonic development involves diffusion and proliferation of cells, as well as diffusion and reaction of molecules, within growing tissues. Mathematical models of these processes often involve reaction-diffusion equations on growing domains that have been primarily studied using approximate numerical solutions. Recently, we have shown how to obtain an exact solution to a single, uncoupled, linear reaction-diffusion equation on a growing domain, 0 < x < L(t), where L(t) is the domain length. The present work is an extension of our previous study, and we illustrate how to solve a system of coupled reaction-diffusion equations on a growing domain. This system of equations can be used to study the spatial and temporal distributions of different generations of cells within a population that diffuses and proliferates within a growing tissue. The exact solution is obtained by applying an uncoupling transformation, and the uncoupled equations are solved separately before applying the inverse uncoupling transformation to give the coupled solution. We present several example calculations to illustrate different types of behaviour. The first example calculation corresponds to a situation where the initially-confined population diffuses sufficiently slowly that it is unable to reach the moving boundary at x = L(t). In contrast, the second example calculation corresponds to a situation where the initially-confined population is able to overcome the domain growth and reach the moving boundary at x = L(t). In its basic format, the uncoupling transformation at first appears to be restricted to deal only with the case where each generation of cells has a distinct proliferation rate. However, we also demonstrate how the uncoupling transformation can be used when each generation has the same proliferation rate by evaluating the exact solutions as an appropriate limit."
10.1101/026260,"O_LIMicro-evolutionary predictions are complicated by ecological feedbacks like density dependence, while ecological predictions can be complicated by evolutionary change. A widely used approach in micro-evolution, quantitative genetics, struggles to incorporate ecological processes into predictive models, while structured population modelling, a tool widely used in ecology, rarely incorporates evolution explicitly.\nC_LIO_LIIn this paper we develop a flexible, general framework that links quantitative genetics and structured population models. We use the quantitative genetic approach to write down the phenotype as an additive map. We then construct integral projection models for each component of the phenotype. The dynamics of the distribution of the phenotype are generated by combining distributions of each of its components. Population projection models can be formulated on per generation or on shorter time steps.\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce the framework before developing example models with parameters chosen to exhibit specific dynamics. These models reveal (i) how evolution of a phenotype can cause populations to move from one dynamical regime to another (e.g. from stationarity to cycles), (ii) how additive genetic variances and covariances (the G matrix) are expected to evolve over multiple generations, (iii) how changing heritability with age can maintain additive genetic variation in the face of selection and (iii) life history, population dynamics, phenotypic characters and parameters in ecological models will change as adaptation occurs.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach unifies population ecology and evolutionary biology providing a framework allowing a very wide range of questions to be addressed. The next step is to apply the approach to a variety of laboratory and field systems. Once this is done we will have a much deeper understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics and feedbacks.\nC_LI"
10.1101/026252,"The origin of the germline-soma distinction is a fundamental unsolved question. Plants and basal metazoans do not have a germline but generate gametes from somatic tissues (somatic gametogenesis), whereas most bilaterians sequester a germline. We develop an evolutionary model which shows that selection for mitochondrial quality drives germline evolution. In organisms with low mitochondrial mutation rates, segregation of mutations over multiple cell divisions generates variation, allowing selection to optimize gamete quality through somatic gametogenesis. Higher mutation rates promote early germline sequestration. Oogamy reduces mitochondrial segregation in early development, improving adult fitness by restricting variation between tissues, but also limiting variation between early-sequestered oocytes, undermining gamete quality. Oocyte variation is restored through proliferation and random culling (atresia) of precursor cells. We predict a novel pathway from basal metazoans lacking a germline to active bilaterians with early sequestration of large oocytes subject to atresia, allowing the emergence of complex developmental processes."
10.1101/026385,"MotivationAdvances in single cell genomics provides a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression experiments is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied to single cell data, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies.\n\nResultsHere, we present a novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering to create a framework for characterising cell state identity. Our methodology uses agglomerative clustering to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cellular states. We demonstrate that using real single cell datasets this approach allows for consistent clustering of single cell transcriptional profiles across multiple scales of interpretation.\n\nAvailabilityR implementation of pcaReduce algorithm is available from https://github.com/JustinaZ/pcaReduce"
10.1101/026310,"ContextThe reconstruction of evolutionary scenarios for whole genomes in terms of genome rearrangements is a fundamental problem in evolutionary and comparative genomics. The DeCo algorithm, recently introduced by Berard et al., computes parsimonious evolutionary scenarios for gene adjacencies, from pairs of reconciled gene trees. However, as for many combinatorial optimization algorithms, there can exist many co-optimal, or slightly sub-optimal, evolutionary scenarios that deserve to be considered.\n\nContributionWe extend the DeCo algorithm to sample evolutionary scenarios from the whole solution space under the Boltzmann distribution, and also to compute Boltzmann probabilities for specific ancestral adjacencies.\n\nResultsWe apply our algorithms to a dataset of mammalian gene trees and adjacencies, and observe a significant reduction of the number of syntenic conflicts observed in the resulting ancestral gene adjacencies."
10.1101/026351,"MotivationGenome browsers that support fast navigation and interactive visual analytics can help scientists achieve deeper insight into large-scale genomic data sets more quickly, thus accelerating the discovery process. Toward this end, we developed Integrated Genome Browser (IGB), a highly configurable, interactive and fast open source desktop genome browser.\n\nResultsHere we describe multiple updates to IGB, including all-new capability to display and interact with data from high-throughput sequencing experiments. To demonstrate, we describe example visualizations and analyses of data sets from RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and bisulfite sequencing experiments. Understanding results from genome-scale experiments requires viewing the data in the context of reference genome annotations and other related data sets. To facilitate this, we enhanced IGBs ability to consume data from diverse sources, including Galaxy, Distributed Annotation, and IGB-specific Quickload servers. To support future visualization needs as new genome-scale assays enter wide use, we transformed the IGB codebase into a modular, extensible platform for developers to create and deploy all-new visualizations of genomic data.\n\nAvailabilityIGB is open source and is freely available from http://bioviz.org/igb.\n\nContactaloraine@uncc.edu"
10.1101/026302,"Genomic instability causes cancers to acquire hundreds to thousands of mutations and chromosomal alterations during their somatic evolution. Most of these mutations and alterations are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggested that mildly-deleterious passengers accumulate, collectively slow cancer progression, reduce the fitness of cancer cells and enhance the effects of therapeutics. However, these effects of passengers and their impact on clinical variables remain limited to genomic analysis. Here, to assess passengers effect on cell fitness and cancer, we specifically introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and mouse models. We found that passenger load dramatically reduced cancer cells fitness in every model investigated. Passengers average fitness cost of [~]3% per MB, indicates that genomic instability in cancer in patients can slow tumor growth and prevent metastatic progression. We conclude that genomic instability in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, yet incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh drivers benefit. Passenger load could be a useful biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and response to mutagenic or passenger-exacerbating therapies, including anti-tumor immunity."
10.1101/026336,"BackgroundPouteria splendens (lucumo chileno) is an endemic shrub to the coastal areas of Central Chile classified as Endangered and Rare by the Chilean threatened species list, but as Lower Risk (LR) by IUCN. Based in historical records some authors have hypothesized that P. splendens originally formed a large metapopulation, but due to habitat loss and fragmentation these populations have been reduced to two main areas separated by 100 km, neither of both currently protected by the Chilean system of protected areas. Knowledge about this species is scarce and no studies have provided evidence to support the large metapopulation hypothesis. This gap of knowledge limits our availability to gauge the real urgency to conserve remaining P. splendens populations, which can generate tragic consequences in light of the increasing land-use change and climatic change that are facing these populations. In this study we combined niche modelling, land-use information, future climatic scenarios, and conservation genetics techniques, to test the hypothesis of a potential original large metapopulation, evaluate the role of land-use change in population decline, assess the threats this species may face in the future, and combine the generated information to re-assess its conservation status using the IUCN criteria.\n\nResultsOur results show that locations with P. splendens are fewer than described in the literature. Results from the niche modelling and genetic analyses support the hypothesis of an originally large metapopulation that was recently reduced and fragmented by anthropogenic land-use change. Future climate change could increase the range of suitable habitats for P. splendens towards inland areas; however the high level of fragmentation of these new areas is expected to preclude colonization processes.\n\nConclusionsBased on our results we recommend urgent actions towards the conservation of this species, including (1) re-evaluating its current IUCN conservation status and reclassifying it as Endangered (EN), and (2) take immediate actions to develop strategies that effectively protect the remaining populations."
10.1101/026369,"The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript."
10.1101/026377,"Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of the response to selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions. Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioural traits, have inherently non-normal distributions. The generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for non-normal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically-convenient latent scale, it is sometimes desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are expressed. The parameters of a fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal for this effect by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulae for quantities such as heritability of traits with Binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation, and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population."
10.1101/026344,"A central aim of evolutionary genomics is to identify the relative roles that various evolutionary forces have played in generating and shaping genetic variation within and among species. Here we use whole-genome re-sequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus: P. tremula, P. tremuloides and P. trichocarpa. We find that P. tremuloides has the highest level of genome-wide variation, skewed allele frequencies and population-scaled recombination rates, whereas P. trichocarpa harbors the lowest. Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, both due to purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species. Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination are largely explaining the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection we observe among species. The present work provides the first phylogenetic comparative study at genome-wide scale in forest trees. This information will also improve our ability to understand how various evolutionary forces have interacted to influence genome evolution among related species."
10.1101/026286,"Our method for \""Time to most recent common ancestor\"" TMRCA of genetic trees for the first time deals with natural selection by apriori mathematics and not as a random factor. Bioprocesses such as \""kin selection\"" generate a few overrepresented \""singular lineages\"" while almost all other lineages terminate. This non-uniform branching gives greatly exaggerated TMRCA with current methods. Thus we introduce an inhomogenous stochastic process which will detect singular lineages by asymmetries, whose \""reduction\"" then gives true TMRCA. This gives a new phylogenetic method for computing mutation rates, with results similar to \""pedigree\"" (meiosis) data. Despite these low rates, reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. We establish accuracy by a comparison across a wide range of time, indeed this is only y-clock giving consistent results for 500-15,000 ybp. In particular we show that the dominant European Y-haplotypes R1a1a & R1b1a2, expand from c4000BC, not reaching Anatolia before c3800BC. This contradicts previous clocks dating R1b1a2 to either the Neolithic Near East or Paleo-Europe. However our dates match R1a1a & R1b1a2 found in Yamnaya cemetaries of c3300BC by Nielsen et al (2015), Paabo et al(2015), together proving R1a1a & R1b1a2 originates in the Russian Steppes."
10.1101/026278,"AbstractHuman migration and human isolation serve as the driving forces of modern human civilization. Recent migrations of long isolated populations has resulted in genetically admixed populations. The history of population admixture is generally complex; however, understanding the admixture process is critical to both evolutionary and medical studies. Here, we utilized admixture induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) to infer occurrence of continuous admixture events, which is common for most existing admixed populations. Unlike previous studies, we expanded the typical continuous admixture model to a more general admixture scenario with isolation after a certain duration of continuous gene flow, and we demonstrated that such treatment significantly improved the accuracy of inference under complex admixture scenarios. Based on the extended models, we developed a method based on weighted LD to infer the admixture history considering continuous and complex demographic process of gene flow between populations. We evaluated the performance of the method by computer simulation and applied our method to real data analysis of a few well-known admixed populations."

A set of 1,801 well-informative EST-SSR primers targeting specific Olive genes included in different biological processes and pathways were generated using 11,215 Olive EST sequences acquired from the NCBI database. Our bioinformatics analytical procedure showed that 8295 SSR motifs were detected which belonged to different motif types with occurrences of 77.6%, 11.84%, 8.62%, 0.84%, 0.77% and 0.29% for Mononucleotide, trinucleotide, dinucleotide, hexanucleotide, pentanucleotide and tetranucleotide respectively. The appearance of the AAG/CTT repeat was highly represented in trinucleotide and the representation of AG/CT was high in dinucleotide repeats. Results obtained from functional annotation of olives EST sequences targeted with our primers set indicated that 78.5% of these sequences having homology with known proteins, while 4.2% was homologous to hypothetical, predicted, unnamed or uncharacterized proteins and the 17.3% sequences did not possess homology with any known proteins.

All tested primers were successfully amplified and only 10 exhibited detectable polymorphism."
10.1101/026401,"BackgroundMulti-electrode arrays (MEAs) allow non-invasive multiunit recording in-vitro from cultured neuronal networks. For sufficient neuronal growth and adhesion on such MEAs, substrate preparation is required. Plating of dissociated neurons on a uniformly prepared MEAs surface results in the formation of spatially extended random networks with substantial inter-sample variability. Such cultures are not optimally suited to study the relationship between defined structure and dynamics in neuronal networks. To overcome these shortcomings, neurons can be cultured with pre-defined topology by spatially structured surface modification. Spatially structuring a MEA surface accurately and reproducibly with the equipment of a typical cell-culture laboratory is challenging.\n\nNew MethodIn this paper, we present a novel approach utilizing microcontact printing (CP) combined with a custom-made device to accurately position patterns on MEAs with high precision. We call this technique AP-CP (accurate positioning micro-contact printing).\n\nComparison with existing MethodsOther approaches presented in the literature using CP for patterning either relied on facilities or techniques not readily available in a standard cell culture laboratory, or they did not specify means of precise pattern positioning.\n\nConclusionHere we present a relatively simple device for reproducible and precise patterning in a standard cell-culture laboratory setting. The patterned neuronal islands on MEAs provide a basis for high throughput electrophysiology to study the dynamics of single neurons and neuronal networks."
10.1101/026427,"Qualitative patterns of gene activation and repression are often conserved despite an abundance of quantitative variation in expression levels within and between species. A major challenge to interpreting patterns of expression divergence is knowing which changes in gene expression affect fitness. To characterize the fitness effects of gene expression divergence we placed orthologous promoters from eight yeast species upstream of malate synthase (MLS1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As expected, we found these promoters varied in their expression level under activated and repressed conditions as well as in their dynamic response following loss of glucose repression. Despite these differences, only a single promoter driving near basal levels of expression caused a detectable loss of fitness. We conclude that the MLS1 promoter lies on a fitness plateau whereby even large changes in gene expression can be tolerated without a substantial loss of fitness."
10.1101/026393,"Increasing evidence shows that, like phenotypic mean, phenotypic variance is also genetically determined, but the underlying mechanisms of genetic control over the variance remain obscure. Here, we conducted variance-association mapping analyses to identify expression variability QTLs (evQTLs), i.e., genomic loci associated with gene expression variance, in humans. We discovered that common genetic variations may contribute to increasing gene expression variability via two distinct modes of action--epistasis and destabilization. Specifically, the epistasis model explains a quarter of the identified evQTLs, of which the formation is attributed to the presence of \""third-party\"" eQTLs that influence the level of gene expression in a fraction, rather than the entire set, of sampled individuals. The destabilization model explains the other three-quarters of evQTLs, which tend to be associated with mutations that disrupt the stability of the transcription process of genes. To show the destabilizing effect, we measured discordant gene expression between monozygotic twins, and time-course stability of gene expression in single samples using repetitive qRT-PCR assays. The destabilizing evQTL SNPs were found to be associated with more pronounced expression discordance between twin pairs and less stable gene expression in single samples. Together, our results suggest that common SNPs may work interactively or independently to shape the variability of gene expression in humans. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of genetic control over phenotypic variance and may have implications for the development of variability-centered analytic methods for quantitative trait mapping."
10.1101/026450,"With the increasing availability of functional genomic data,1-3 incorporating genomic annotations into genetic association analysis has become a standard procedure. However, the existing methods often lack rigor and/or computational efficiency and consequently do not maximize the utility of functional annotations. In this paper, we propose a rigorous inference procedure to perform integrative association analysis incorporating genomic annotations for both traditional GWAS and emerging molecular QTL mapping studies. In particular, we propose an algorithm, named \""Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors\"" (DAP), which enables highly efficient and accurate joint enrichment analysis and identification of multiple causal variants. We use a series of simulation studies to highlight the power and computational efficiency of our proposed approach and further demonstrate it by analyzing the cross-population eQTL data from the GEUVADIS project and the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx project. In particular, we find that genetic variants predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding sites are enriched in cis-eQTLs across all tissues. Moreover, the enrichment estimates obtained across the tissues are correlated with the cell types for which the annotations are derived."
10.1101/026435,"Thousands of candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) have been identified, supporting the idea that unique to human phenotypes result from human-specific changes to genomic regulatory networks (GRNs). The sequence quality of reference genome databases is essential for the accurate definition of regulatory DNA segments as candidate HSRS. It is unclear how database improvements would affect the validity of the HSRS definition. Sequence conservation analysis of 15,371 candidate HSRS was carried out using the most recent releases of reference genomes databases of humans and nonhuman primates (NHP) defining the conservation threshold as the minimum ratio of bases that must remap of 1.00. This analysis identifies 3,793 regulatory DNA segments that lack evidence of human-specific mutations and represent regulatory sequences highly conserved in humans, Bonobo, and Chimpanzee. Present analysis revealed a major database refinements effect on the validity of HSRS definition and suggests that human-specific phenotypes may evolve as a results of integration into human-specific GRNs of both conserved in NHP and human-specific genomic regulatory elements."
10.1101/026419,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used for more than 20 years to investigate brain function by perturbing and observing the consequent behavioral, pathophysiological and electrophysiological modulations. These latter, mainly measured by high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG), revealed signatures of the functional organization in a brain network. In order to unveil the nature and the underlying mechanism of these signatures, we here mapped TMS-induced hd-EEG changes onto changes in information flow and brain structural architecture, using multimodal modeling of source reconstructed TMS/hd-EEG recordings and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography in a cohort of awake healthy volunteers. We observed that the relationship between information flow and structural connections depend on the stimulation site and on the frequency of the TMS-induced brain rhythms. These findings highlight the importance of taking into account the dynamics of different local oscillations when investigating the mechanisms for integration and segregation of information in the human brain. Our whole-brain analysis sheds light on the function-structure organization of the brain network after TMS, and on the huge variety of information contained in it.

10.1101/026518,"We present an open source package for performing evolutionary quantitative genetics analyses in the R environment for statistical computing. Evolutionary theory shows that evolution depends critically on the available variation in a given population. When dealing with many quantitative traits this variation is expressed in the form of a covariance matrix, particularly the additive genetic covariance matrix or sometimes the phenotypic matrix, when the genetic matrix is unavailable. Given this mathematical representation of available variation, the EvolQG package provides functions for calculation of relevant evolutionary statistics, estimation of sampling error, corrections for this error, matrix comparison via correlations and distances, and functions for testing evolutionary hypotheses on taxa diversification."
10.1101/026492,"The realisation that heterozygosity can be heritable has recently generated some elegant research. However, none of this work has discussed the fact that when heterozygote advantage occurs, heterozygosity can be heritable, yet allele frequencies remain at equilibrium and do not evolve with time. From a quantitative genetic perspective this means the character is heritable, is under selection, yet no response to selection is observed. We explain why this is the case, and discuss potential implications for the study of evolution in the wild."
10.1101/026500,"The cardinal feature of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning is the ability of animals to associate the taste or flavor of a food (the conditioned stimulus; CS) with a subsequent toxic effect (unconditioned stimulus; US), even if the toxicity occurs hours later, i.e. after a long delay. Two experiments were conducted which took advantage of the stimulus control afforded by intraoral catheterization to establish the parameters of long-delay learning in intraoral CTA. First, to determine the range of CS-US intervals which supports intraoral conditioning, rats received infusions of 5% sucrose paired with LiCl (76 mg/kg, ip) across a range of delays (0-6 h). Second, to determine the interaction of US dose and delay, rats were conditioned with sucrose paired with different doses of LiCl (19, 38 or 76 mg/kg) at several CS-US intervals (0, 10, or 60 min). Con-ditioning, assessed during a second infusion of sucrose at 48 h post-conditioning, was optimal at 10 min (although not significantly different at intervals between 0 and 60 min). Effectiveness declined at longer delays, such that CTA was not supported at intervals of 3h or greater. The dose-interval function suggested that an increased US can compensate for a longer CS-US interval. Low doses of LiCl induced a long-term CTA at 0-min (19 and 38 mg/kg) or 10-min delays (38 mg/kg), but were not sufficient to induce CTA at longer delays, which required the highest dose (76 mg/kg)."
10.1101/026476,"Phylogenetic trees are central to many areas of biology, ranging from population genetics and epidemiology to microbiology, ecology, and macroevolution. The ability to summarize properties of trees, compare different trees, and identify distinct modes of division within trees is essential to all these research areas. But despite wide-ranging applications, there currently exists no common, comprehensive framework for such analyses. Here we present a graph-theoretical approach that provides such a framework. We show how to construct the spectral density profiles of phylogenetic trees from their Laplacian graphs. Using ultrametric simulated trees as well as non-ultrametric empirical trees, we demonstrate that the spectral density successfully identifies various properties of the trees and clusters them into meaningful groups. Finally, we illustrate how the eigengap can identify modes of division within a given tree. As phylogenetic data continue to accumulate and to be integrated into various areas of the life sciences, we expect that this spectral graph-theoretical framework to phylogenetics will have powerful and long-lasting applications."
10.1101/026559,"Inside individual cells, expression of genes is inherently stochastic and manifests as cell-to-cell variability or noise in protein copy numbers. Since proteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in cell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein levels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy numbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and daughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total noise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and partitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise is decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii) partitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division events. These formulas reveal that random cell-division times not only generate additional extrinsic noise but also critically affect the mean protein copy numbers and intrinsic noise components. Counter intuitively, in some parameter regimes noise in protein levels can decrease as cell-division times become more stochastic. Computations are extended to consider genome duplication, where the gene dosage is increased by two-fold at a random point in the cell-cycle. We systematically investigate how the timing of genome duplication influences different protein noise components. Intriguingly, results show that noise contribution from stochastic expression is minimized at an optimal genome duplication time. Our theoretical results motivate new experimental methods for decomposing protein noise levels from single-cell expression data. Characterizing the contributions of individual noise mechanisms will lead to precise estimates of gene expression parameters and techniques for altering stochasticity to change phenotype of individual cells."

The expression of these markers is examined at both the mRNA and protein level. Our results show that the metastatic cell line, MM127, cannot be detected using any of the commonly used melanoma-associated markers. This implies that it would be very difficult to identify this particular cell line in a heterogeneous sample, and as a result this cell line should be used with care."
10.1101/026575,"EuroAmerican land use and its legacies have transformed forest structure and composition across the United States (US). More accurate reconstructions of historical states are critical to understanding the processes governing past, current, and future forest dynamics. Gridded (8x8km) estimates of pre-settlement (1800s) forests from the upper Midwestern US (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and most of Michigan) using 19th Century Public Land Survey (PLS) records provide relative composition, biomass, stem density, and basal area for 26 tree genera. This mapping is more robust than past efforts, using spatially varying correction factors to accommodate sampling design, azimuthal censoring, and biases in tree selection.\n\nWe compare pre-settlement to modern forests using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, with respect to structural changes and the prevalence of lost forests, pre-settlement forests with no current analogue, and novel forests, modern forests with no past analogs. Differences between PLSS and FIA forests are spatially structured as a result of differences in the underlying ecology and land use impacts in the Upper Midwestern United States. Modern biomass is higher than pre-settlement biomass in the northwest (Minnesota and northeastern Wisconsin, including regions that were historically open savanna), and lower in the east (eastern Wisconsin and Michigan), due to shifts in species composition and, presumably, average stand age. Modern forests are more homogeneous, and ecotonal gradients are more diffuse today than in the past. Novel forest assemblages represent 29% of all FIA cells, while 25% of pre-settlement forests no longer exist in a modern context.\n\nLost forests are centered around the forests of the Tension Zone, particularly in hemlock dominated forests of north-central Wisconsin, and in oak-elm-basswood forests along the forest-prairie boundary in south central Minnesota and eastern Wisconsin. Novel FIA forest assemblages are distributed evenly across the region, but novelty shows a strong relationship to spatial distance from remnant forests in the upper Midwest, with novelty predicted at between 20 to 60km from remnants, depending on historical forest type.\n\nThe spatial relationships between remnant and novel forests, shifts in ecotone structure and the loss of historic forest types point to significant challenges to land managers if landscape restoration is a priority in the region. The spatial signals of novelty and ecological change also point to potential challenges in using modern spatial distributions of species and communities and their relationship to underlying geophysical and climatic attributes in understanding potential responses to changing climate. The signal of human settlement on modern forests is broad, spatially varying and acts to homogenize modern forests relative to their historic counterparts, with significant implications for future management."
10.1101/026583,"Sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are a significant source of monetary losses on salmon farms. Sea lice exhibit temperature-dependent development rates and salinity-dependent mortality, but to date no deterministic models have incorporated these seasonally varying factors. To understand how environmental variation and life history characteristics affect sea lice abundance, we derive a delay differential equation model and parameterize the model with environmental data from British Columbia and southern Newfoundland. We calculate the lifetime reproductive output for female sea lice maturing to adulthood at different times of the year and find differences in the timing of peak reproduction between the two regions. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that sea lice abundance is more sensitive to variation in mean annual water temperature and mean annual salinity than to variation in life history parameters. Our results suggest that effective sea lice management requires consideration of site-specific temperature and salinity patterns and, in particular, that the optimal timing of production cycles and sea lice treatments might vary between regions."
10.1101/026641,"Evolutionary relationships are described by phylogenetic trees, but a central barrier in many fields is the difficulty of interpreting data containing conflicting phylogenetic signals. Obtaining credible trees that capture the relationships present in complex data is one of the fundamental challenges in evolution today. We present a way to map trees which extracts distinct alternative evolutionary relationships embedded in data and resolves phylogenetic uncertainty. Our method reveals a remarkably distinct phylogenetic signature in the VP30 gene of Ebolavirus, indicating possible recombination with significant implications for vaccine development. Moving to higher organisms, we use our approach to detect alternative histories of the evolution of anole lizards. Our approach has the capacity to resolve key areas of uncertainty in the study of evolution, and to broaden the credibility and appeal of phylogenetic methods."
10.1101/025536,"Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation and is, therefore, central to evolutionary change. Previous work on Paramecium tetraurelia found an unusually low germline base-substitution mutation rate in this ciliate. Here, we tested the generality of this result among ciliates using Tetrahymena thermophila. We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline and developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads. Our probabilistic mutation-calling method provides a straightforward way of estimating the number of sites at which a mutation could have been called if one was present, providing the denominator for our mutation rate calculations. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved. Because selection can only operate to reduce mutation rates based upon the \""visible\"" mutational load, asexual reproduction with a transcriptionally silent germline may allow ciliates to evolve extremely low germline mutation rates."

This pathogen-specific diagnostic tool uses a very general assay that relies only on a training cohort coupled with immunosequencing and sophisticated data analysis. Since all memory T cell responses are encoded in the common format of somatic TCR rearrangements, a key advantage of reading T cell memory to predict disease status is that this approach should apply to a wide variety of diseases. The underlying dataset is the largest collection of TCRs ever published, including [~]300 gigabases of sequencing data and [~]85 million unique TCRs across 640 HLA-typed individuals, which constitutes by far the largest such collection ever published. We expect these data to be a valuable public resource for researchers studying the TCR repertoire."
10.1101/026617,"Neuronal circuit mapping using electron microscopy demands laborious proofreading or reconciliation of multiple independent reconstructions. Here, we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically-enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of Drosophila sensorimotor (larva) and visual (adult) systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small, microtubule-free \""twigs\"" which branch off a single microtubule-containing \""backbone\"". Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96% of errors. However, the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions, we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity."
10.1101/026658,"The long-held principle that functionally important proteins evolve slowly has recently been challenged by studies in mice and yeast showing that the severity of a protein knockout only weakly predicts that protein's rate of evolution. However, the relevance of these studies to evolutionary changes within proteins is unknown, because amino acid substitutions, unlike knockouts, often only slightly perturb protein activity. To quantify the phenotypic effect of small biochemical perturbations, we developed an approach to use computational systems biology models to measure the influence of individual reaction rate constants on network dynamics. We show that this dynamical influence is predictive of protein domain evolutionary rate in vertebrates and yeast, even after controlling for expression level and breadth, network topology, and knockout effect. Thus, our results not only demonstrate the importance of protein domain function in determining evolutionary rate, but also the power of systems biology modeling to uncover unanticipated evolutionary forces."
10.1101/026625,"Barley was introduced to North America [~]400 years ago but adaptation to modern production environments is more recent. Comparisons of allele frequencies among different growth habits and inflorescence types in North America indicate significant genetic differentiation has accumulated in a relatively short evolutionary time span. Allele frequency differentiation is greatest among barley with two-row versus six-row inflorescences, and then by spring versus winter growth habit. Large changes in allele frequency among breeding programs suggest a major contribution of genetic drift and linked selection on genetic variation. Despite this, comparisons of 3,613 modern North American cultivated breeding lines that differ for row type and growth habit permit the discovery of 183 SNP outliers putatively linked to targets of selection. For example, SNPs within the Cbf4, Ppd-H1, and Vrn-H1 loci which have previously been associated with agronomically-adaptive phenotypes, are identified as outliers. Analysis of extended haplotype-sharing identifies genomic regions shared within and among breeding programs, suggestive of a number of genomic regions subject to recent selection. Finally, we are able to identify recent bouts of gene flow between breeding programs that could point to the sharing of agronomically-adaptive variation. These results are supported by pedigrees and breeders understanding of germplasm sharing."
10.1101/026666,"The activity of ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons can be represented as a set of points in the space of firing rates. Even though the dimension of this space is equal to the ensemble size, neural activity can be effectively localized on smaller subspaces. The dimensionality of the neural space is an important determinant of the computational tasks supported by the neural activity. Here, we investigate the dimensionality of neural ensembles from the sensory cortex of alert rats during periods of ongoing (intertrial) and stimulus-evoked activity. We find that dimensionality grows linearly with ensemble size, and grows significantly faster during ongoing activity compared to evoked activity. We explain these results using a spiking network model based on a clustered architecture. The model captures the difference in growth rate between ongoing and evoked activity and predicts a characteristic scaling with ensemble size that could be tested in high-density multi-electrode recordings. Moreover, we present a simple theory that predicts the existence of an upper bound on dimensionality. This upper bound is inversely proportional to the amount of pair-wise correlations and, compared to a homogeneous network without clusters, it is larger by a factor equal to the number of clusters. The empirical estimation of such bounds depends on the number and duration of trials and is well predicted by the theory. Together, these results provide a framework to analyze neural dimensionality in alert animals, its behavior under stimulus presentation, and its theoretical dependence on ensemble size, number of clusters, and correlations in spiking network models."
10.1101/026674,"The role played by interlayer connections in shaping local responses and their long-range coupling has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we analyze a rate model of a canonic local circuit with realistic anatomy. We find that this circuit generates a rich repertoire of possible dynamical states, including an oscillatory regime in which gamma-and beta-oscillations dominate in superficial and deep layers, respectively, in agreement with experimental observations. This regime stems from non-linear inter-layer interactions, independently from intrinsic resonance properties of distinct layers. Moreover, by connecting two local circuits via cortico-cortical projections, the emergent phase differences define a flexible and frequency-dependent inter-areal hierarchy. Such dynamic patterns generally do not arise in randomized circuits, and the compatible connectomes are rare, although not unique. Altogether, these results suggest that inter-layer connectivity is homeostatically regulated to make local circuits fit to integrate and multiplex signals from several sources in multiple frequency bands.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe local circuit of mammalian cortex presents a characteristic multilayered structure, with feedforward (and feedback) cortico-cortical connections originating from (and targeting) distinct and well defined layers. Here, we model how such a structure fundamentally shapes the dynamical repertoire of local cortical oscillatory states and their long-range interaction. Experimental evidence, matched by our simulations, suggests that different cortical layers oscillate at different frequencies and that neuronal oscillations at different frequencies are exploited for communication in different directions. While this laminar specificity of oscillations is often explained in terms of multiple inhibitory populations with different resonance properties, we show here that it could alternatively emerge as a byproduct of the collective local circuit dynamics. Our modelling study indicates furthermore that the empirically observed multi-frequency oscillatory patterns cannot be reproduced in presence of an arbitrary interlayer connectivity. In this sense, therefore, we believe that the adopted connectome, derived from neuroanatomical reconstructions, is \""special\"". Nevertheless, it is not unique, since other, very different connectomes may also lead to a matching dynamical repertoire. This suggests that a multiplicity of non-random canonical circuit templates may share largely overlapping functions, robustly achieved and maintained via functional homeostasis mechanisms."
10.1101/026682,"Tuning curves are the functions that relate the responses of sensory neurons to various values within one continuous stimulus dimension (such as the orientation of a bar in the visual domain or the frequency of a tone in the auditory domain). They are commonly determined by fitting a model e.g. a Gaussian or other bell-shaped curves to the measured responses to a small subset of discrete stimuli in the relevant dimension. However, as neuronal responses are irregular and experimental measurements noisy, it is often difficult to determine reliably the appropriate model from the data. We illustrate this general problem by fitting diverse models to representative recordings from area MT in rhesus monkey visual cortex during multiple attentional tasks involving complex composite stimuli. We find that all models can be well-fitted, that the best model generally varies between neurons and that statistical comparisons between neuronal responses across different experimental conditions are affected quantitatively and qualitatively by specific model choices. As a robust alternative to an often arbitrary model selection, we introduce a model-free approach, in which features of interest are extracted directly from the measured response data without the need of fitting any model. In our attentional datasets, we demonstrate that data-driven methods provide descriptions of tuning curve features such as preferred stimulus direction or attentional gain modulations which are in agreement with fit-based approaches when a good fit exists. Furthermore, these methods naturally extend to the frequent cases of uncertain model selection. We show that model-free approaches can identify attentional modulation patterns, such as general alterations of the irregular shape of tuning curves, which cannot be captured by fitting stereotyped conventional models. Finally, by comparing datasets across different conditions, we demonstrate effects of attention that are cell-and even stimulus-specific. Based on these proofs-of-concept, we conclude that our data-driven methods can reliably extract relevant tuning information from neuronal recordings, including cells whose seemingly haphazard response curves defy conventional fitting approaches."
10.1101/026716,"Various initiatives to identify global priority areas for conservation have been developed over the last 20 years (e.g. Biodiversity Hotspots). However, translating this information to actionable local scales has proven to be a major task, highlighting the necessity of efforts to bridge the global-scale priority areas with local-based conservation actions. Furthermore, as these global priority areas are increasingly threatened by climate change and by the loss and alteration of their natural habitats, developing additional efforts to identify priority areas for restoration activities is becoming an urgent task. In this study we used a Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (SMCDA) approach to help optimize the selection of sites for restoration initiatives of two endemic threatened flora species of the \""Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forest\"" Hotspot. Our approach takes advantage of freely GIS software, niche modeling tools, and available geospatial databases, in an effort to provide an affordable methodology to bridge global-scale priority areas with local actionable restoration scales. We used a set of weighting scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of short-term vs long-term planning perspective in prioritization results. The generated SMCDA was helpful for evaluating, identifying and prioritizing best suitable areas for restoration of the assessed species. The method proved to be simple, transparent, cost effective and flexible enough to be easily replicable on different ecosystems. This approach could be useful for prioritizing regional-scale areas for species restoration in Chile, as well as in other countries with restricted budgets for conservation efforts."
10.1101/026732,"Abstract Existing models of parental investment have mainly focused on interactions at the level of the family, and have paid much less attention to the impact of population-level processes. Here we extend classical models of parental care to assess the impact of population structure and limited dispersal. We find that sex-differences in dispersal substantially affect the amount of care provided by each parent, with the more philopatric sex providing the majority of the care to young. This effect is most pronounced in highly viscous populations: in such cases, when classical models would predict stable biparental care, inclusion of a modest sex difference in dispersal leads to uniparental care by the philopatric sex. In addition, mating skew also affects sex-differences in parental investment, with the more numerous sex providing most of the care. However, the effect of mating skew only holds when parents care for their own offspring. When individuals breed communally, we recover the previous finding that the more philopatric sex provides most of the care, even when it is the rare sex. Finally, we show that sex-differences in dispersal can mask the existence of sex-specific costs of care, because the philopatric sex may provide most of the care even in the face of far higher mortality costs relative to the dispersing sex. We conclude that sex-biased dispersal is likely to be an important, yet currently overlooked driver of sex-differences in parental care."
10.1101/026724,"The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is threatened throughout its distribution, and is categorized as vulnerable by IUCN (Lefebvre 2001, IUCN 2007). The number of mature individuals is currently estimated at less than 10,000 and is expected to decline at a rate of at least 10% over the next 20 years as a result of both habitat loss and anthropogenic factors (Deutsch et al. 2008). While the West Indian manatee is the most widespread of all existing sirenians, some populations are estimated at fewer than 10 individuals (Deutsch et al. 2008, Quintana-Rizzo and Reynolds 2010). In addition, in most Central American countries reliable information on manatee distribution and conservation status is missing and there is need to assess these remnant populations to guide future management strategies."
10.1101/026765,"AimChanges in community composition resulting from environmental changes modify biotic interactions and affect the distribution and density of local populations. Such changes are currently occurring in nettle-feeding butterflies in Sweden where Araschnia levana has recently expanded its range northward and is now likely to interact with the resident species (Aglais urticae and Aglais io). Butterfly occurrence data collected over years and across regions enabled us to investigate how a recent range expansion of A. levana may have affected the environmental niche of resident species.\n\nLocationWe focused on two regions of Sweden (Sk[a]ne and Norrstrom) where A. levana has and has not established, and two time-periods (2001-2006, 2009-2012) during its establishment in Sk[a]ne.\n\nMethodsWe performed two distinct analyses in each region using the PCA-env and the framework described in Broennimann et al. (2012). First, we described the main sources of variation in the environment. Second, in each time-period and region, we characterized the realized niches of our focal species across topographic and land use gradients. Third, we quantified overlaps and differences in realized niches between and within species over time.\n\nResultsIn Sk[a]ne, A. levana has stabilized its distribution over time while the distribution of the native species has shifted. These shifts depicted a consistent pattern of avoiding overlap between the native species and the environmental space occupied by A. levana, and it was stronger for A. urticae than for A. io. In both regions, we also found evidence of niche partitioning between native species.\n\nMain conclusionsInterspecific interactions are likely to affect local species distributions. It appears that the ongoing establishment of A. levana has modified local biotic interactions, and induced shifts in resident species distributions. Among the mechanisms that can explain such patterns of niche partitioning, parasitoid-driven apparent competition may play an important role in this community."
10.1101/026740,"The stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula Latreille 1811 is distributed from Mexico to Argentina and is one of the most widespread bee species in the Neotropics. However, this wide distribution contrasts with the short distance traveled by females to build new nests. Here we evaluate the genetic structure of several populations of T. angustula using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. These markers can help us to detect differences in the migratory behavior of males and females. Our results show that the populations are highly differentiated suggesting that both females and males have low dispersal distance. Therefore, its continental distribution probably consists of several cryptic species."
10.1101/026757,"Admixture-introduced linkage disequilibrium (LD) has recently been introduced into the inference of the histories of complex admixtures. However, the influence of ancestral source populations on the LD pattern in admixed populations is not properly taken into consideration by currently available methods, which affects the estimation of several gene flow parameters from empirical data. We first illustrated the dynamic changes of LD in admixed populations and mathematically formulated the LD under a generalized admixture model with finite population size. We next developed a new method, MALDmef, by fitting LD with multiple exponential functions for inferring and dating multiple-wave admixtures. MALDmef takes into account the effects of source populations which substantially affect modeling LD in admixed population, which renders it capable of efficiently detecting and dating multiple-wave admixture events. The performance of MALDmef was evaluated by simulation and it was shown to be more accurate than MALDER, a state-of-the-art method that was recently developed for similar purposes, under various admixture models. We further applied MALDmef to analyzing genome-wide data from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) and the HapMap Project. Interestingly, we were able to identify more than one admixture events in several populations, which have yet to be reported. For example, two major admixture events were identified in the Xinjiang Uyghur, occurring around 27-30 generations ago and 182-195 generations ago, respectively. In an African population (MKK), three recent major admixtures occurring 13-16, 50-67, and 107-139 generations ago were detected. Our method is a considerable improvement over other current methods and further facilitates the inference of the histories of complex population admixtures."
10.1101/026781,"Hybridization is known to occur in a wide range of avian species, yet the rate and persistence of hybridization on populations is often hard to assess. Genotyping using variable genetic marker sets has become a common tool to identify hybrid individuals, however assignment outputs can differ depending on the marker set used. Here, we study hybrid assignment in two sibling Hippolais warblers, where hybrid assignment has shown to differ between SSR and AFLP markers. Simulation of heterospecific individuals as well as backcrosses (typed using SSR markers) reveals a rapid loss of assignment probability in higher backcross generations.\n\nHowever, the characterization of F1 hybrids was clearly distinguished from both parental taxa. The differences in marker sets are not contradictory but complementary. The rate of hybridization is lower than previously expected with AFLP markers but introgression might be long-lasting. This could be either due to differences in power of the marker systems used or due to non-neutral variation covered by AFLP but not SSR markers. We call for more attention to be paid regarding the potential limits of classical marker systems to investigate hybridization and its persistence in natural systems."
10.1101/026799,"Errors during transcription may play an important role in determining cellular phenotypes: the RNA polymerase error rate is >4 orders of magnitude higher than that of DNA polymerase and errors are amplified >1000-fold due to translation. However, current methods to measure RNA polymerase fidelity are low-throughout, technically challenging, and organism specific. Here I show that changes in RNA polymerase fidelity can be measured using standard RNA sequencing protocols. I find that RNA polymerase is error-prone, and these errors can result in splicing defects. Furthermore, I find that differential expression of RNA polymerase subunits causes changes in RNA polymerase fidelity, and that coding sequences may have evolved to minimize the effect of these errors. These results suggest that errors caused by RNA polymerase may be a major source of stochastic variability at the level of single cells.\n\nThe information that determines protein sequence is stored in the genome but that in ..."

We encourage the neuroimage community to contribute with their own diffantoms and share them openly.
10.1101/026856,"Whole genome sequencing using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies offers powerful opportunities to study genetic variation. Mapping the mutations responsible for different phenotypes is generally an involved and time-consuming process so researchers have developed user-friendly tools for mapping-by-sequencing, yet they are not applicable to organisms with non-sequenced genomes. We introduce SDM (SNP Distribution Method), a reference independent method for rapid discovery of mutagen-induced mutations in typical forward genetic screens. SDM aims to order a disordered collection of HTS reads or contigs such that the fragment carrying the causative mutation can be identified. SDM uses typical distributions of homozygous SNPs that are linked to a phenotype-altering SNP in a non-recombinant region as a model to order the fragments. To implement and test SDM, we created model genomes with an idealised SNP density based on Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 1 and analysed fragments with size distribution similar to reads or contigs assembled from HTS sequencing experiments. SDM groups the contigs by their normalised SNP density and arranges them to maximise the fit to the expected SNP distribution. We tested the procedure in existing datasets by examining SNP distributions in recent out-cross and back-cross experiments in Arabidopsis thaliana backgrounds. In all the examples we analysed, homozygous SNPs were normally distributed around the causal mutation. We used the real SNP densities obtained from these experiments to prove the efficiency and accuracy of SDM. The algorithm was able to successfully identify small sized (10-100 kb) genomic regions containing the causative mutation."
10.1101/026872,"Single-cell genomics has revolutionised modern biology while requiring the development of advanced computational and statistical methods. Advances have been made in uncovering gene expression heterogeneity, discovering new cell types and novel identification of genes and transcription factors involved in cellular processes. One such approach to the analysis is to construct pseudotime orderings of cells as they progress through a particular biological process, such as cell-cycle or differentiation. These methods assign a score - known as the pseudotime - to each cell as a surrogate measure of progression. However, all published methods to date are purely algorithmic and lack any way to give uncertainty to the pseudotime assigned to a cell. Here we present a method that combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM) with a recently published electroGP prior to perform Bayesian inference on the pseudotimes. We go on to show that the posterior variability in these pseudotimes leads to nontrivial uncertainty in the pseudo-temporal ordering of the cells and that pseudotimes should not be thought of as point estimates."
10.1101/026534,"BackgroundRecent advances in high-throughput technologies have facilitated the profiling of large panels of cancer cell lines with responses measured for thousands of drugs. The computational challenge is now to realize the potential of these data in predicting patients responses to these drugs in the clinic.\n\nMethodsWe address this issue by examining the spectrum of prediction models of patient response: models predicting directly from cell lines, those predicting directly from patients, and those trained on cell lines and patients at the same time. We tested 21 classification models on four drugs, that are bortezomib, erlotinib, docetaxel and epirubicin, for which clinical trial data were available.\n\nResultsOur integrative models consistently outperform cell line-based predictors, indicating that there are limitations to the predictive potential of in vitro data alone. Furthermore, these integrative models achieve better predictive accuracy and require substantially fewer patients than would be the case if only patient data were available.\n\nConclusionsThe integration of in vitro and ex vivo genomic data results in more accurate predictors using only a fraction of the patient information, which can help optimize the development of personalized predictors of therapy response. Altogether our results support the relevance of preclinical data for therapy prediction in clinical trials, enabling more efficient and cost-effective trial design."
10.1101/026831,"The contribution of pre-mRNA processing mechanisms to the regulation of immune responses remains poorly studied despite emerging examples of their role as regulators of immune defenses. Here, we used mRNA sequencing to quantify gene expression and isoform abundances in primary macrophages from 60 individuals, before and after infection with two live bacteria. In response to both bacteria we identified thousands of genes that significantly change isoform usage in response to infection, and found global shifts towards (i) the inclusion of cassette exons and (ii) shorter 3 UTRs. Using complementary data collected in non-human primates, we show that these features are evolutionarily conserved among primates. Finally, our results suggest that the pervasive usage of shorter 3 UTRs is a mechanism for particular genes to evade repression by immune-activated miRNAs. Collectively, our results show that dynamic changes in RNA processing play a key role in the regulation of innate immune responses."

10.1101/026823,"BackgroundA complete genome sequence and the advent of genome editing open up non-traditional model organisms to mechanistic genetic studies. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is an important vector of infectious diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, and has a large and complex genome, which has slowed annotation efforts. We used comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of adult gene expression to improve the genome annotation and to provide a detailed tissue-specific catalogue of neural gene expression at different adult behavioral states.\n\nResultsWe carried out deep RNA sequencing across all major peripheral male and female sensory tissues, the brain, and (female) ovary. Furthermore, we examined gene expression across three important phases of the female reproductive cycle, a remarkable example of behavioral switching in which a female mosquito alternates between obtaining blood-meals from humans and laying eggs. Using genome-guided alignments and de novo transcriptome assembly, our re-annotation includes 572 new putative protein-coding genes and updates to 13.5% and 50.3% of existing transcripts within coding sequences and untranslated regions, respectively. Using this updated annotation, we detail gene expression in each tissue, identifying large numbers of transcripts regulated by blood-feeding and sexually dimorphic transcripts that may provide clues to the biology of male- and female-specific behaviors, such as mating and blood-feeding, which are areas of intensive study for those interested in vector control.\n\nConclusionsThis neurotranscriptome forms a strong foundation for the study of genes in the mosquito nervous system and investigation of sensory-driven behaviors and their regulation. Furthermore, understanding the molecular genetic basis of mosquito chemosensory behavior has important implications for vector control."
10.1101/027045,"Spatial organization of the genome is critical for condition-specific gene expression. Previous studies have shown that functionally related genes tend to be spatially proximal. However, these studies have not been extended to multiple human cell types, and the extent to which context-specific spatial proximity of a pathway is related to its context-specific activity is not known. We report the first pathway-centric analyses of spatial proximity in six human cell lines. We find that spatial proximity of genes in a pathway tends to be context-specific, in a manner consistent with the pathways context-specific expression and function; housekeeping genes are ubiquitously proximal to each other, and cancer-related pathways such as p53 signaling are uniquely proximal in hESC. Intriguingly, we find a correlation between the spatial proximity of genes and interactions of their protein products, even after accounting for the propensity of co-pathway proteins to interact. Related pathways are also often spatially proximal to one another, and housekeeping genes tend to be proximal to several other pathways suggesting their coordinating role. Further, the spatially proximal genes in a pathway tend to be the drivers of the pathway activity and are enriched for transcription, splicing and transport functions. Overall, our analyses reveal a pathway-centric organization of the 3D nucleome whereby functionally related and interacting genes, particularly the initial drivers of pathway activity, but also genes across multiple related pathways, are in spatial proximity in a context-specific way. Our results provide further insights into the role of differential spatial organization in cell type-specific pathway activity."
10.1101/026922,"DNA assembly is a core methodological step in metagenomic pipelines used to study the structure and function within microbial communities. Here we investigate the utility of Pacific Biosciences long and high accuracy circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads for metagenomics projects. We compared the application and performance of both PacBio CCS and Illumina HiSeq data with assembly and taxonomic binning algorithms using metagenomic samples representing a complex microbial community. Eight SMRT cells produced approximately 94 Mb of CCS reads from a biogas reactor microbiome sample, which averaged 1319 nt in length and 99.7 % accuracy. CCS data assembly generated a comparative number of large contigs greater than 1 kb, to those assembled from a [~]190x larger HiSeq dataset ([~]18 Gb) produced from the same sample (i.e approximately 62 % of total contigs). Hybrid assemblies using PacBio CCS and HiSeq contigs produced improvements in assembly statistics, including an increase in the average contig length and number of large contigs. The incorporation of CCS data produced significant enhancements in taxonomic binning and genome reconstruction of two dominant phylotypes, which assembled and binned poorly using HiSeq data alone. Collectively these results illustrate the value of PacBio CCS reads in certain metagenomics applications."
10.1101/026963,"BackgroundCharacterization of genetic variations in maize has been challenging, mainly due to deterioration of collinearity between individual genomes in the species.

However, the fact that the B73 genome used as the reference only represents a fraction of all haplotypes is still an important limiting factor."
10.1101/027086,"Beneficial mutations fuel adaptation by altering phenotypes that enhance the fit of organisms to their environment. However, the phenotypic effects of mutations often depend on ecological context, making the distribution of effects across multiple environments essential to understanding the true nature of beneficial mutations. Studies that address both the genetic basis and ecological consequences of adaptive mutations remain rare. Here, we characterize the direct and pleiotropic fitness effects of a collection of 21 first-step beneficial mutants derived from naive and adapted genotypes used in a long-term experimental evolution of Escherichia coli. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify most beneficial mutations. In contrast to previous studies, we find diverse fitness effects of mutations selected in a simple environment and few cases of genetic parallelism. The pleiotropic effects of these mutations were predominantly positive but some mutants were highly antagonistic in alternative environments. Further, the fitness effects of mutations derived from the adapted genotypes were dramatically reduced in nearly all environments. These findings suggest that many beneficial variants are accessible from a single point on the fitness landscape, and the fixation of alternative beneficial mutations may have dramatic consequences for niche breadth reduction via metabolic erosion."
10.1101/026914,"Historical biogeography seeks to understand the distribution of biodiversity in space and time. The dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model, a likelihood-based model of geographic range evolution, is widely used in assessing the biogeography of clades. Robust inference of dispersal and local extinction parameters is crucial for biogeographic inference, and yet a major caveat to its use is that the DEC model severely underestimates local extinction. We suggest that this is mainly due to the way in which the model is constructed to allow observed species to transition into being present in no areas (i.e., null range). By prohibiting transitions into the null range in the transition rate matrix, we were able to better infer local extinction and support this with simulations. This modified model, DEC*, has higher model fit and model adequacy than DEC, suggesting this modification should be considered for DEC and other models of geographic range evolution."
10.1101/026591,"There has been much interest in analyzing genome-scale DNA sequence data to infer population histories, but inference methods developed hitherto are limited in model complexity and computational scalability. Here we present an efficient, flexible statistical method, diCal2, that can utilize whole-genome sequence data from multiple populations to infer complex demographic models involving population size changes, population splits, admixture, and migration. Applying our method to data from Australian, East Asian, European, and Papuan populations, we find that the population ancestral to Australians and Papuans started separating from East Asians and Europeans about 100,000 years ago, and that the separation of East Asians and Europeans started about 50,000 years ago, with pervasive gene flow between all pairs of populations."

We developed a method based on single-cell analysis to phenotype human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) by high-throughput imaging. Our method uses markers for morphology and pluripotency as well as social features to characterize perturbations using a meta-phenotype based on mapping single cells to distinct phenotypic classes. Analysis of perturbations on a single cell level enhances the applicability of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) for screening experiments taking the inherently increased phenotypic variability of these cells into account. We adapted miniaturized culture conditions to allow for the utilization of hIPSC in RNA interference (RNAi) high-throughput screens and single cell phenotyping by image analysis. We identified key regulators of pluripotency in hIPSC masked in a population-averaged analysis and we confirmed several candidate genes (SMG1, TAF1) and assessed their effect on pluripotency."
10.1101/026948,"Single-cell transcriptome measurements are being applied at rapidly increasing scales to study cellular repertoires underpinning functions of complex tissues and organs, including mammalian brains. The transcriptional state of each cell, however, reflects a variety of biological factors, including persistent cell-type specific regulatory configurations, transient processes such as cell cycle, local metabolic demands, and extracellular signals. Depending on the biological setting, all such aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity can be of potential interest, but detecting complex heterogeneity structure from inherently uncertain single-cell data presents analytical challenges. We developed PAGODA to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells. We demonstrate that PAGODA effectively recovers the subpopulations and their corresponding functional characteristics in a variety of single-cell samples, and use it to characterize transcriptional diversity of neuronal progenitors in the developing mouse cortex."
10.1101/026989,"Perception is subjective. Even basic judgments, like those of visual object size, vary substantially between observers and also across the visual field within the same observer. The way in which the visual system determines the size of objects remains unclear, however. We hypothesize that object size is inferred from neuronal population activity in V1 and predict that idiosyncrasies in cortical functional architecture should therefore explain individual differences in size judgments. Indeed, using novel behavioral methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we demonstrate that biases in size perception are correlated with the spatial tuning of neuronal populations in healthy volunteers. To explain this relationship, we formulate a population read-out model that directly links the spatial distribution of V1 representations to our perceptual experience of visual size. Altogether, we suggest that the individual perception of simple stimuli is warped by idiosyncrasies in visual cortical organization."
10.1101/027276,"The functional mechanisms underlying disease association identified by Genome-wide Association Studies remain unknown for susceptibility loci located outside gene coding regions. In addition to the regulation of gene expression, synthesis of effects from multiple surrounding functional variants has been suggested as an explanation of hard-to-interpret associations.\n\nHere, we define filter criteria based on linkage disequilibrium measures and allele frequencies which reflect expected properties of synthesizing variant sets. For eligible candidate sets we search for those haplotypes that are highly correlated with the risk alleles of a genome-wide associated variant.\n\nWe applied our methods to 1,000 Genomes reference data and confirmed Crohns Disease and Type 2 Diabetes susceptibility loci. Of these, a proportion of 32% allowed explanation by three-variant-haplotypes carrying at least two functional variants, as compared to a proportion of 16% for random variants (P = 2.92 {middle dot} 10-6). More importantly, we detected examples of known loci whose association can fully be explained by surrounding missense variants: three missense variants from MUC19 synthesize rs11564258 (L0C105369736/MUC19, intron; Crohns Disease). Next, rs2797685 (PER3, intron; Crohns Disease) is synthesized by a 57 kilobase haplotype defined by five missense variants from PER3 and three missense variants from UTS2. Finally, the association of rs7178572 (HMG20A, intron; Type 2 Diabetes) can be explained by the synthesis of eight haplotypes, each carrying at least one missense variant in either PEAK1, TBC1D2B, CHRNA5 or ADAMTS7.\n\nIn summary, application of our new methods highlights the potential of synthesis analysis to guide functional follow-up investigation of findings from association studies."
10.1101/026971,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been rapidly adopted for genome editing. However, one major issue with this system is the lack of robust bioinformatics tools for design of single guide RNA (sgRNA), which determines the efficacy and specificity of genome editing. To address this pressing need, we analyze CRISPR RNA-seq data and identify many novel features that are characteristic of highly potent sgRNAs. These features are used to develop a bioinformatics tool for genome-wide design of sgRNAs with improved efficiency. These sgRNAs as well as the design tool are freely accessible via a web server, WU-CRISPR (http://crispr.wustl.edu)."
10.1101/027227,"1The accurate identification of low-frequency variants in tumors remains an unsolved problem. To support characterization of the issues in a realistic setting, we have developed software tools and a reference dataset for diagnosing variant calling pipelines. The dataset contains millions of variants at frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 1.0. To generate the dataset, we performed whole-genome sequencing of a mixture of two Corriel cell lines, NA19240 and NA12878, the mothers of YRI (Y) and CEU (C) HapMap trios, respectively. The cells were mixed in three different proportions, 10Y/90C, 50Y/50C and 90Y/10C, in an effort to simulate the heterogeneity found in tumor samples. We sequenced three biological replicates for each mixture, yielding approximately 1.4 billion reads per mixture for an average of 64X coverage. Using the published genotypes as our reference, we evaluate the performance of a general variant calling algorithm, constructed as a demonstration of our flexible toolset, and make comparisons to a standard GATK pipeline. We estimate the overall FDR to be 0.028 and the FNR (when coverage exceeds 20X) to be 0.019 in the 50Y/50C mixture. Interestingly, even with these relatively well studied individuals, we predict over 475,000 new variants, validating in well-behaved coding regions at a rate of 0.97, that were not included in the published genotypes."
10.1101/027219,"Advances in RNA-seq technologies provide unprecedented insight into the variability and heterogeneity of gene expression at the single-cell level. However, such data offers only a snapshot of the transcriptome, whereas it is often the progression of cells through dynamic biological processes that is of interest. As a result, one outstanding challenge is to infer such progressions by ordering gene expression from single cell data alone, known as the cell ordering problem. Here, we introduce a new method that constructs a low-dimensional non-linear embedding of the data using laplacian eigenmaps before assigning each cell a pseudotime using principal curves. We characterise why on a theoretical level our method is more robust to the high levels of noise typical of single-cell RNA-seq data before demonstrating its utility on two existing datasets of differentiating cells."
10.1101/027060,"Searching targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, we identified zinc finger protein 191 (ZNF191) as a suppressor against HCC metastasis. Over-expressing ZNF191 in HCC cells impaired cell motility, while ZNF191 depletion promoted HCC cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo through triggering yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that ZNF191 specifically bound to the promoter of Discs, Large homolog 1 (DLG1), a cell polarity maintainer and a negative regulator of YAP1. Double-knockdown experiments showed that DLG1 was not only the mediator of ZNF191s function to suppress migration but also a link between ZNF191 and YAP1 signaling. ZNF191 was down-regulated in metastatic HCCs, correlating positively with DLG1 levels and inversely with YAP1 activation. Our findings indicate ZNF191 functions as a metastasis suppressor via DLG1-mediated YAP1 signaling inactivation."
10.1101/027078,"Declines in pollinator abundance and diversity are not only a conservation issue but also a threat to crop pollination. Maintained infrastructure corridors, such as those containing electricity transmission lines, are potentially important wild pollinator habitat. However, there is a lack of evidence comparing the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators in transmission corridors with other important pollinator habitats. We compared the diversity of a key pollinator group, bumble bees (Bombus spp.), between transmission corridors and the surrounding semi-natural and managed habitat types at ten sites across Swedens Uppland region. Our results show that transmission corridors have no impact on bumble bee diversity in the surrounding area. However, transmission corridors and other maintained habitats have a level of bumble bees abundance and diversity comparable to semi-natural grasslands and host species that are important for conservation and ecosystem service provision. Under the current management regime, transmission corridors already provide valuable bumble bee habitat, but given that host plant density is the main determinant of bumble bee abundance, these areas could potentially be enhanced by establishing and maintaining key host plants. We show that in northern temperate regions the maintenance of transmission corridors has the potential to contribute to bumble bee conservation and the ecosystem services they provide."
10.1101/027235,"Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) enables the detection of species of interest from water and soil samples, typically using species-specific PCR. Here, we describe a method to characterize the biodiversity of a given environment by amplifying eDNA using primer pairs targeting a wide range of taxa and high-throughput sequencing for species identification. We tested this approach on 91 water samples of 40 mL collected along the Cuyahoga River (Ohio, USA). We amplified eDNA using 12 primer pairs targeting mammals, fish, amphibians, birds, bryophytes, arthropods, copepods, plants and several microorganism taxa and sequenced all PCR products simultaneously by high-throughput sequencing. Overall, we identified DNA sequences from 15 species of fish, 17 species of mammals, 8 species of birds, 15 species of arthropods, one turtle and one salamander. Interestingly, in addition to aquatic and semiaquatic animals, we identified DNA from terrestrial species that live near the Cuyahoga River. We also identified DNA from one Asian carp species invasive to the Great Lakes but that had not been previously reported in the Cuyahoga River. Our study shows that analysis of eDNA extracted from small water samples using wide-range PCR amplification combined with high-throughput sequencing can provide a broad perspective on biological diversity."
10.1101/027169,"AbstractAlthough a large number of methods have been proposed to control the non-linear dynamics of unstable popuations, very few have been actually adopted for application. One reason for this gap is the fact that few control methods have been empirically verified using biological populations. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of two well-studied control methods (Both Limiter Control and Target-Oriented Control) on the dynamics of unstable populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that both methods can significantly reduce population fluctuations, decrease extinction probability and increase effective population size simultaneously. This is in contrast with single parameter control methods that are not able to achieve multiple aspects of stability at the same time. We use the distribution of population sizes to derive biologically intuitive explanations for the mechanisms of how these two control methods attain stability. Finally, we show that non-Drosophila specific biologically realistic simulations are able to capture almost all the trends of our data. This shows that our results are likely generalizable over a wide range of taxa. The primary insight of our study is that control methods that incorporate both culling and restocking have better all-round performance in terms of stabilizing populations."
10.1101/027292,"Cells that mutate or commit to a specialized function (differentiate) often undergo conversions that are effectively irreversible. Slowed growth of converted cells can act as a form of selection, balancing unidirectional conversion to maintain both cell types at a steady-state ratio. However, when one-way conversion is insuffciently counterbalanced by selection, the original cell type will ultimately be lost, often with negative impacts on the populations overall ftness. The critical balance between selection and conversion needed for preservation of unconverted cells and the steady-state ratio between cell types depends on the spatial circumstances under which cells proliferate. We present experimental data on a yeast strain engineered to undergo irreversible conversion: this synthetic system permits cell type-specifc fuorescent labeling and exogenous variation of the relative growth and conversion rates. We fnd that populations confned to grow on a fat agar surface are more susceptible than their well-mixed counterparts to ftness loss via a conversion-induced \""meltdown.\"" We then present analytical predictions for growth in several biologically-relevant geometries - well-mixed liquid media, radially-expanding two-dimensional colonies, and linear fronts in two dimensions - by employing analogies to the directed percolation transition from non-equilibrium statistical physics. These simplifed theories are consistent with the experimental results."
10.1101/027003,"Scientists have access to artifacts of evolutionary history (namely, the fossil record and genomic sequences of living organisms) but they have limited means with which to infer the exact evolutionary events that occurred to produce todays living world. An intriguing question to arise from this historical limitation is whether the evolutionary paths of organisms are dominated by internal or external controlled processes (i.e., Life as a factory) or whether they are inherently random and subject to completely different outcomes if repeated under identical conditions (i.e., Life as a casino parlor). Two experimental approaches, ancestral sequence reconstruction and experimental evolution with microorganisms, can be used to recapitulate ancient adaptive pathways and provide valuable insights into the mutational steps that constitute an organisms genetic heritage. Ancestral sequence reconstruction follows a backwards-from-present-day strategy in which various ancestral forms of a modern gene or protein are reconstructed and then studied mechanistically. Experimental evolution, by contrast, follows a forward-from-present day strategy in which microbial populations are evolved in the laboratory under defined conditions in which their evolutionary paths may be closely monitored. Here I describe a novel hybrid of these two methods, in which synthetic components constructed from inferred ancestral gene or protein sequences are placed into the genomes of modern organisms that are then experimentally evolved. Through this system, we aim to establish the comparative study of ancient phenotypes as a novel, statistically rigorous methodology with which to explore the respective impacts of biophysics and chance in evolution within the scope of the Extended Synthesis."
10.1101/027144,"The modular organization of the phenotype is an emergent property that derives from a semi-independent relation of body parts in their inheritance, development, function, and evolution. Understanding the modular organization of living beings is essential to understand the evolvability and plasticity of organismal form, and how morphological variation is structured during evolution and development. For this reason, delimiting morphological modules and establishing the factors originating them is a lively field of inquiry in biology today. However, unifying the results of the available body of knowledge is a challenge because of the large number of species studied and the disparity of morphological system, from the flower of angiosperms to the wing of insects and the head of primates (to name a few). The specific factors behind each pattern of modularity and the methods used to identify vary widely as well. This review summarizes more than 190 original research articles since 1958, in order to get a quantitative appraisal on what is studied, how is studied, and how results are explained. The results reveal an heterogeneous picture, where some taxa, systems, and approaches are over-studied, while others receive minor attention; other major trends and gaps in the study of morphological modularity through time are also discussed. In sum, this systematic review seeks to offer an objective view of this research field and highlight future research niches."
10.1101/027185,"BackgroundTechnological advances in DNA sequencing have made gene testing fast and more affordable. Evidence of cost-effectiveness of genetic service models is essential for successful translation, but remain sparse in the literature. In particular there is a lack of cost data related to genetic services.\n\nMethodsA detailed micro-costing of 28 pathways relating to breast and/or ovarian cancer and gene testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (termed  BRCA testing) was carried out. These data were combined with patient-level data from a Royal Marsden Cancer Genetics Service audit during which BRCA testing was offered to individuals at [&ge;]10% risk of having a mutation.\n\nResultsThe average cost across all pathways was {pound}2,222.68 (range {pound}376.47-{pound}13,531.24). The average pathway cost for a person with cancer was {pound}1897.71 compared to {pound}2,403.22 for a person without cancer. Of the women seen during audit period, 38% were affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer and 62% were unaffected but concerned about their family history.\n\nConclusionThere is considerable variation in the costs of different gene testing pathways. Improved cost-efficiency could be achieved by increasing the proportion of cancer patients tested, because the pathway cost of an unaffected individual in whom testing has already been performed in a relative with cancer is considerably less.\n\nAcknowledgementsWe acknowledge NHS funding to the Royal Marsden/ICR NIHR Specialist Biomedical Research Centre for Cancer.

10.1101/027284,"Nanopore sequencing at single-base resolution is challenging. There are developing technologies to convert DNA molecules to expanded constructs. Such constructs can be sequenced by nanopores in place of the original DNA molecules. We present a novel method for converting genomic DNA to expanded constructs (\""proxies\"") with 99.67% accuracy. Our method \""reads\"" each base in each DNA fragment and appends an oligonucleotide to the DNA fragment after each base \""reading\"". Each appended oligonucleotide represents a specific base type, so that the proxy construct consisting of all the appended oligonucleotides faithfully represents the original DNA sequence. We generated proxies for genomic DNA and confirmed the identities of both the proxies and their corresponding original DNA sequences by performing sequencing using Ion Torrent sequencer.\n\nConversion to proxies had only 0.33% raw error rate. Errors were: 93.96% deletions, 5.29% insertions, and 0.74% substitutions. The longest sequenced proxy was 170 bases, corresponding to a 17-base original DNA sequence. The short length of the detected proxies reflected restrictions imposed by Ion Torrents short reads and was not caused by limitations of our method. The consensus sequence built by using proxies alone (average length: 120 bases; corresponding to original sequences with average length 12 bases) covered 55% of the reference genome with 100% accuracy, and outperformed the Ion Torrent sequencing of the corresponding original DNA fragments in terms of accuracy, coverage and number of aligned sequences. Data and other materials can be found at http://www.vastogen.com/data.html. This proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates highly accurate proxy construction at the whole genome level. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated construction of expanded versions of DNA at the whole genome level."
10.1101/027151,"Animals and plants have evolved a range of mechanisms for recognizing noxious substances and organisms. A particular challenge, most successfully met by the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, is the specific recognition of potential pathogens, which themselves evolve to escape recognition. A variety of genomic and evolutionary mechanisms shape large families of proteins dedicated to detecting pathogens and create the diversity of binding sites needed for epitope recognition. One family involved in innate immunity are the NACHT-domain-and Leucine-Rich-Repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Mammals have a small number of NLR proteins, which are involved in first-line immune defense and recognize several conserved molecular patterns. However, there is no evidence that they cover a wider spectrum of differential pathogenic epitopes. In other species, mostly those without adaptive immune systems, NLRs have expanded into very large families. A family of nearly 400 NLR proteins is encoded in the zebrafish genome. They are subdivided into four groups defined by their NACHT and effector domains, with a characteristic overall structure that arose in fishes from a fusion of the NLR domains with a domain used for immune recognition, the B30.2 domain. The majority of the genes are located on one chromosome arm, interspersed with other large multi-gene families, including a new family encoding proteins with multiple tandem arrays of Zinc fingers. This chromosome arm may be a hot spot for evolutionary change in the zebrafish genome. NLR genes not on this chromosome tend to be located near chromosomal ends.\n\nExtensive duplication, loss of genes and domains, exon shuffling and gene conversion acting differentially on the NACHT and B30.2 domains have shaped the family. Its four groups, which are conserved across the fishes, are homogenised within each group by gene conversion, while the B30.2 domain is subject to gene conversion across the groups. Evidence of positive selection on diversifying mutations in the B30.2 domain, probably driven by pathogen interactions, indicates that this domain rather than the LRRs acts as a recognition domain. The NLR-B30.2 proteins represent a new family with diversity in the specific recognition module that is present in fishes in spite of the parallel existence of an adaptive immune system."
10.1101/026930,"In this study, we adapt a protocol for the growth of previously uncultured environmental bacterial isolates, to make it compatible with whole genome sequencing. We demonstrate that in combination with the MinION sequencing device, complete assemblies can be derived, allowing genomic comparisons to be made. This approach allows rapid, inexpensive and straightforward discovery, and genomic analysis, of previously uncultured prokaryotic genomes, and brings greater ownership of all parts of the sequencing process back to individual researchers."
10.1101/027102,"Cortical population activity may represent sampling from an internal model. Using data from rats learning rules on a maze task, we show that sampling rates of population activity patterns in prefrontal cortex converge between waking and sleep over learning. Sample rate changes were greatest for activity patterns predictive of correct choice and expressed at the choice point. Our results suggest inference-by-sampling is a general computational principle for cortex."
10.1101/027268,"Understanding the structure and dynamics of cortical connectivity is vital to understanding cortical function. Experimental data strongly suggest that local recurrent connectivity in the cortex is significantly non-random, exhibiting, for example, above-chance bidirectionality and an overrepresentation of certain triangular motifs. Additional evidence suggests a significant distance dependency to connectivity over a local scale of a few hundred microns, and particular patterns of synaptic turnover dynamics, including a heavy-tailed distribution of synaptic efficacies, a power law distribution of synaptic lifetimes, and a tendency for stronger synapses to be more stable over time. Understanding how many of these non-random features simultaneously arise would provide valuable insights into the development and function of the cortex. While previous work has modeled some of the individual features of local cortical wiring, there is no model that begins to comprehensively account for all of them. We present a spiking network model of a rodent Layer 5 cortical slice which, via the interactions of a few simple biologically motivated intrinsic, synaptic, and structural plasticity mechanisms, qualitatively reproduces these non-random effects when combined with simple topological constraints. Our model suggests that mechanisms of self-organization arising from a small number of plasticity rules provide a parsimonious explanation for numerous experimentally observed non-random features of recurrent cortical wiring. Interestingly, similar mechanisms have been shown to endow recurrent networks with powerful learning abilities, suggesting that these mechanism are central to understanding both structure and function of cortical synaptic wiring.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe problem of how the brain wires itself up has important implications for the understanding of both brain development and cognition. The microscopic structure of the circuits of the adult neocortex, often considered the seat of our highest cognitive abilities, is still poorly understood. Recent experiments have provided a first set of findings on the structural features of these circuits, but it is unknown how these features come about and how they are maintained. Here we present a neural network model that shows how these features might come about. It gives rise to numerous connectivity features, which have been observed in experiments, but never before simultaneously produced by a single model. Our model explains the development of these structural features as the result of a process of self-organization. The results imply that only a few simple mechanisms and constraints are required to produce, at least to the first approximation, various characteristic features of a typical fragment of brain microcircuitry. In the absence of any of these mechanisms, simultaneous production of all desired features fails, suggesting a minimal set of necessary mechanisms for their production."
10.1101/027177,"Spontaneous bursting activity in cultured neuronal networks is initiated by leader neurons, which constitute a small subset of first-to-fire neurons forming a sub-network that recruits follower neurons into the burst. While the existence and stability of leader neurons is well established, the influence of stimulation on the leader-follower dynamics is not sufficiently understood. By combining multi-electrode array recordings with whole field optical stimulation of cultured Channelrhodopsin-2 transduced hippocampal neurons, we show that fade-in photo-stimulation induces a significant shortening of intra-burst firing rate peak delay of follower electrodes after offset of the stimulation compared to unperturbed spontaneous activity. Our study shows that optogenetic stimulation can be used to change the dynamical fine structure of self-organized network bursts."
10.1101/027391,"Many populations live in environments subject to frequent biotic and abiotic changes. Nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether an evolving populations mean fitness can increase indefinitely, and potentially without any limit, even in a constant environment. A recent study showed that fitness trajectories of Escherichia coli populations over 50,000 generations were better described by a power-law model than by a hyperbolic model. According to the power-law model, the rate of fitness gain declines over time but fitness has no upper limit, whereas the hyperbolic model implies a hard limit. Here, we examine whether the previously estimated power-law model predicts the fitness trajectory for an additional 10,000 generations. To that end, we conducted more than 1100 new competitive fitness assays. Consistent with the previous study, the power-law model fits the new data better than the hyperbolic model. We also analysed the variability in fitness among populations, finding subtle, but significant, heterogeneity in mean fitness. Some, but not all, of this variation reflects differences in mutation rate that evolved over time. Taken together, our results imply that both adaptation and divergence can continue indefinitely-- or at least for a long time--even in a constant environment."
10.1101/027334,"Chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) uses fusion of a protein of interest to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to target calcium-dependent cleavage to specific genomic loci in vivo. Here we report the combination of ChEC with high-throughput sequencing (ChEC-seq) to map budding yeast transcription factor (TF) binding. Temporal analysis of ChEC-seq data reveals two classes of sites for TFs, one displaying rapid cleavage at sites with robust consensus motifs and the second showing slow cleavage at largely unique sites with low-scoring motifs. Sites with high-scoring motifs also display asymmetric cleavage, indicating that ChEC-seq provides information on the directionality of TF-DNA interactions. Strikingly, similar DNA shape patterns are observed regardless of motif strength, indicating that the kinetics of ChEC-seq discriminates DNA recognition through sequence and/or shape. We propose that time-resolved ChEC-seq detects both high-affinity interactions of TFs with consensus motifs and sites preferentially sampled by TFs during diffusion and sliding."
10.1101/027326,"The acquisition of nutrients is essential for maintenance of metabolic processes in all organisms. Nutritional imbalance contributes to myriad metabolic disorders that include malnutrition, diabetes, and even cancer. Recently, the importance of macronutrient ratio of food has emerged as a critical factor to determine health outcomes. Here we show that individual modifications to a completely defined diet markedly impact multiple aspects of organism wellbeing in Drosophila melanogaster. Through a longitudinal survey of several diets we demonstrate that increased levels of dietary glucose significantly improve longevity and immunity in adult Drosophila. Our metagenomic studies, show that relative macronutrient levels not only influence the host, but also have a profound impact on microbiota composition. However, we found that elevated dietary glucose extended the lifespan of adult flies even when raised in a germ-free environment. Furthermore, when challenged with a chronic enteric infection, flies fed a diet with added glucose had increased survival times even in the absence of an intact microbiota. Thus, in contrast to known links between the microbiota and animal health, our findings uncover a novel microbiota-independent response to diet that impacts host wellbeing. As dietary responses are highly conserved in animals, we believe our results offer a general understanding of the association between glucose metabolism and animal health."
10.1101/027375,"Motoneurons developmentally acquire appropriate cellular architectures that ensure connections with postsynaptic muscles and presynaptic neurons. In Drosophila, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. Here we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. A behavioral screen identified roles for Semaphorins (Serna) and Plexins (Plex) in walking behavior. Deciphering this phenotype, we show that PlexA/Sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. Importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; PlexB/Sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. These findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different Plexin/Semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map."

10.1101/027383,"Hybridization is recognized as a powerful mechanism of speciation and a driving force in generating biodiversity. However, only few multicellular species, limited to a handful of plants and animals, have been shown to fulfill all the criteria of homoploid hybrid speciation. This lack of evidence could lead to the misconception that speciation by hybridization has a limited role in eukaryotes, particularly in single-celled organisms. Laboratory experiments have revealed that fungi such as budding yeasts can rapidly develop reproductive isolation and novel phenotypes through hybridization, showing that in principle homoploid speciation could occur in nature. Here we report a case of homoploid hybrid speciation in natural populations of the budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus inhabiting the North American forests. We show that the rapid evolution of chromosome architecture and an ecological context that led to secondary contact between nascent species drove the formation of an incipient hybrid species with a potentially unique ecological niche.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryChromosomal rearrangements and hybridization between two yeast lineages drive hybrid speciation after secondary contact."
10.1101/027367,"Selection of oviposition sites by gravid females is a critical behavioural preference in the reproductive cycle of Anopheles gambiae, the principal Afrotropical malaria vector mosquito. Several studies suggest this decision is mediated by semiochemicals associated with potential oviposition sites. To better understand the chemosensory basis of this behaviour and identify compounds that can modulate oviposition, we examined the generally held hypothesis that suboptimal larval habitats give rise to semiochemicals that negatively influence the oviposition preference of gravid females. Dual-choice bioassays indicated that oviposition sites conditioned in this manner do indeed foster significant and concentration dependent aversive effects on the oviposition site selection of gravid females. Headspace analyses derived from aversive habitats consistently noted the presence of dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (sulcatone) each of which unitarily affected An. gambiae oviposition preference. Electrophysiological assays across the antennae, maxillary palp, and labellum of gravid An. gambiae revealed differential responses to these semiochemicals. Taken together, these findings validate the hypothesis in question and suggest that suboptimal environments for An. gambiae larval development results in the release of DMDS, DMTS and sulcatone that impact the response valence of gravid females to directly modulate the chemical ecology of oviposition site selection."

The resulting models can provide key hints in uncovering the evolutionary trajectories of cancer, especially for precision medicine or personalized therapy.\n\nAvailabilityTRONCO is released under the GPL license, it is hosted in the Software section at http://bimib.disco.unimib.it/ and archived also at bioconductor.org.\n\nContacttronco@disco.unimib.it"
10.1101/027359,"The genomic evolution inherent to cancer relates directly to a renewed focus on the voluminous next generation sequencing (NGS) data, and machine learning for the inference of explanatory models of how the (epi)genomic events are choreographed in cancer initiation and development. However, despite the increasing availability of multiple additional - omics data, this quest has been frustrated by various theoretical and technical hurdles, mostly stemming from the dramatic heterogeneity of the disease. In this paper, we build on our recent works on \""selective advantage\"" relation among driver mutations in cancer progression and investigate its applicability to the modeling problem at the population level. Here, we introduce PiCnIc (Pipeline for Cancer Inference), a versatile, modular and customizable pipeline to extract ensemble-level progression models from cross-sectional sequenced cancer genomes. The pipeline has many translational implications as it combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations and progression model inference. We demonstrate PiCnIcs ability to reproduce much of the current knowledge on colorectal cancer progression, as well as to suggest novel experimentally verifiable hypotheses.\n\nSO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOW O_SCPLOWOFC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW: A causality based new machine learning Pipeline for Cancer Inference (PicNic) is introduced to infer the underlying somatic evolution of ensembles of tumors from next generation sequencing data.

10.1101/027433,"The wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the best understood microbial eukaryote at the molecular and cellular level, yet its natural geographic distribution is unknown. Here we report the results of a field survey for S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus and other budding yeast on oak trees in Europe. We show that yeast species differ in their geographic distributions, and investigated which ecological variables can predict the isolation rate of S. paradoxus, the most abundant species. We find a positive association between trunk girth and S. paradoxus abundance suggesting that older trees harbour more yeast. S. paradoxus isolation frequency is also associated with summer temperature, showing highest isolation rates at intermediate temperatures. Using our statistical model, we estimated a range of summer temperatures at which we expect high S. paradoxus isolation rates, and show that the geographic distribution predicted by this optimum temperature range is consistent with the worldwide distribution of sites where S. paradoxus has been isolated. Using laboratory estimates of optimal growth temperatures for S. cerevisiae relative to S. paradoxus, we also estimated an optimum range of summer temperatures for S. cerevisiae. The geographical distribution of these optimum temperatures are consistent with the locations where wild S. cerevisiae have been reported, and can explain why only human-associated S. cerevisiae strains are isolated at northernmost latitudes. Our results provide a starting point for targeted isolation of S. cerevisiae from natural habitats, which could lead to a better understanding of climate associations and natural history in this important model microbe."
10.1101/027441,"Despite growing evidence for nongenetic inheritance, the ecological conditions that favor the evolution of heritable parental or grandparental effects remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically explore the evolution of parental effects in a patch-structured population with locally changing environments. When selection favors the production of a mix of offspring types, this mix differs according to the parental phenotype, implying that parental effects are favored over selection for bet-hedging in which the mixture of offspring phenotypes produced does not depend on the parental phenotype. Positive parental effects (generating a positive correlation between parental and offspring phenotype) are favored in relatively stable habitats and when different types of local environment are roughly equally abundant, and can give rise to long-term parental inheritance of phenotypes. By contrast, unstable habitats can favor negative parental effects (generating a negative correlation between parental and offspring phenotype), and under these circumstances even slight asymmetries in the abundance of local environmental states select for marked asymmetries in transmission fidelity."
10.1101/027466,"Vision allows animals to detect spatial differences in environmental light levels. High-resolution image-forming eyes evolved from low-resolution eyes via increases in photoreceptor cell number, improvements in optics and changes in the neural circuits that process spatially resolved photoreceptor input. However, the evolutionary origins of the first low-resolution visual systems have been unclear. We propose that the lowest-resolving (two-pixel) visual systems could initially have functioned in visual phototaxis. During visual phototaxis, such elementary visual systems compare light on either side of the body to regulate phototactic turns. Another, even simpler and non-visual strategy is characteristic of helical phototaxis, mediated by sensory-motor eyespots. The recent mapping of the complete neural circuitry (connectome) of an elementary visual system in the larva of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii sheds new light on the possible paths from non-visual to visual phototaxis and to image-forming vision. We outline an evolutionary scenario focusing on the neuronal circuitry to account for these transitions. We also present a comprehensive review of the structure of phototactic eyes in invertebrate larvae and assign them to the non-visual and visual categories. We propose that non-visual systems may have preceded visual phototactic systems in evolution that in turn may have repeatedly served as intermediates during the evolution of image-forming eyes."
10.1101/027318,"Deer farming is a significant international industry. For genetic improvement, using genomic tools, an ordered array of DNA variants and associated flanking sequence across the genome is required. This work reports a comparative assembly of the deer genome and subsequent DNA variant identification. Next generation sequencing combined with an existing bovine reference genome enabled the deer genome to be assembled sufficiently for large-scale SNP discovery. In total, 28 Gbp of sequence data were generated from seven Cervus elaphus (European red deer and Canadian elk) individuals. After aligning sequence to the bovine reference genome build UMD 3.0 and binning reads into one Mbp groups; reads were assembled and analyzed for SNPs. Greater than 99% of the non-repetitive fraction of the bovine genome was covered by deer chromosomal scaffolds. We identified 1.8 million SNPs meeting Illumina InfiniumII SNP chip technical threshold. Markers on the published Red x Pere David deer linkage map were aligned to both UMD3.0 and the new deer chromosomal scaffolds. This enabled deer linkage groups to be assigned to deer chromosomal scaffolds, although the mapping locations remain based on bovine order. Genotyping of 270 SNPs on a Sequenom MS system showed that 88% of SNPs identified could be amplified. Also, inheritance patterns showed no evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A comparative assembly of the deer genome, alignment with existing deer genetic linkage groups and SNP discovery has been successfully completed and validated facilitating application of genomic technologies for subsequent deer genetic improvement."
10.1101/027417,"The extent of range overlap of incipient and recent species depends on the type and magnitude of phenotypic divergence that separates them. Trait divergence by social selection likely initiates many speciation events, but may yield niche-conserved lineages predisposed to limit each others ranges via ecological competition. Here we examine this neglected aspect of social selection speciation theory in relation to the discovery of a non-ecotonal species border between sunbirds. We find that Nectarinia moreaui and N. fuelleborni meet in a ~6 km wide contact zone, as estimated by molecular cline analysis. These species exploit similar bioclimatic niches, but sing highly divergent learned songs, consistent with divergence by social selection. Cline analyses suggest that within-species stabilizing social selection on song-learning predispositions maintains species differences in song despite both hybridization and cultural transmission in the contact zone. We conclude that ecological competition between moreaui and fuelleborni contributes to the stabilization of the species border, but that ecological competition acts in conjunction with reproductive interference. The evolutionary maintenance of learned song differences in a hybrid zone recommend this study system for future studies on the mechanisms of learned song divergence and its role in speciation."
10.1101/027490,"Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of common genetic variants associated with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. These studies have focused on additive association tests. Identifying deviations from additivity may provide new biological insights and explain some of the missing heritability for these diseases.\n\nTo identify non-additive associations we performed a genome-wide association study using a dominance deviation model for BMI, obesity and Type 2 diabetes (4,040 cases) in 120,286 individuals of British ancestry from the UK Biobank study.\n\nKnown obesity-associated variants in FTO showed strong evidence for deviation from additivity (P=3x10-5) through a recessive effect of the BMI-increasing allele. The average BMI of individuals carrying 0, 1 or 2 BMI-raising alleles was 27.27kg/m2 (95% CI:27.22-27.31), 27.54kg/m2 (95% CI:27.50-27.58), and 28.07kg/m2 (95% CI:28.0-28.14), respectively. A similar effect was observed in 105,643 individuals from the GIANT consortium (P=0.003; Pmeta-analysis=1x10-7). We also detected a recessive effect (Pdomdev=5x10-4) at CDKAL1 for Type 2 diabetes risk. Homozygous risk allele carriers had an OR=1.48 (95% CI:1.32-1.65) in comparison to the heterozygous group that had an OR=1.06 (95% CI:0.99-1.14), a result consistent with a previous study. We did not identify any novel genome-wide associations.\n\nIn conclusion, although we find no evidence for widespread non-additive effects contributing to the genetic risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes, we find robust examples of recessive effects at the FTO and CDKAL1 loci."
10.1101/027458,"Electron microscopy-based connectomics aims to comprehensively map synaptic connections in neural tissue. However, current approaches are limited in their capacity to directly assign molecular identities to neurons. Here, we use serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) and serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) to identify multiple peptidergic neurons in a connectome. The high immunogenicity of neuropeptides and their broad distribution along axons, allowed us to identify distinct neurons by immunolabeling small subsets of sections within larger series. We demonstrate the scalability of siGOLD by using 11 neuropeptide antibodies on a full-body larval ssTEM dataset of the annelid Platynereis. We also reconstruct a peptidergic circuitry comprising the sensory nuchal organs, found by siGOLD to express pigment-dispersing factor, a circadian neuropeptide. Our approach enables the direct overlaying of chemical neuromodulatory maps onto synaptic connectomic maps in the study of nervous systems."
10.1101/027508,"Antimetabolite chemotherapies increase uracil levels in DNA, and thus identification of factors that influence the uracil content in DNA may have implications for understanding uracil-mediated chromosomal instability. We previously showed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that uracil content in DNA correlates with replication timing, where the earliest and latest replicating regions are depleted in uracil. Here, we manipulated nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes in budding yeast to determine whether the pattern of uracil incorporation could be altered. In strains with high levels of uracil incorporation, deletion of dCMP deaminase (Dcd1) accelerated uracil incorporation at early-firing origins, likely due to rapid dTTP pool depletion. In contrast, increasing the activity of ribonucleotide reductase, which is required for the synthesis of all dNTPs via ribonucleotide diphosphates, lead to dUTP and dTTP pool equilibration and a concomitant increase in uracil content throughout the genome. These data suggest that uracil availability and the dUTP:dTTP ratio are temporally regulated during S phase and govern uracil incorporation into the genome. Therapeutic manipulation of nucleotide biosynthesis in human cells to either increase the dUTP pool or deplete the dTTP pool in early S phase may therefore improve the efficacy of antimetabolite chemotherapies."
10.1101/027540,"Forward genetic screens represent powerful, unbiased approaches to uncover novel components in any biological process. Such screens suffer from a major bottleneck, however, namely the cloning of corresponding genes causing the phenotypic variation. Reverse genetic screens have been employed as a way to circumvent this issue, but can often be limited in scope. Here we demonstrate an innovative approach to gene discovery. Using C. elegans as a model system, we used a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation library, from the Million Mutation Project, together with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), to rapidly screen for and identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest, namely defects in dye-filling of ciliated sensory neurons. Such anomalies in dye-filling are often associated with the disruption of cilia, organelles which in humans are implicated in sensory physiology (including vision, smell and hearing), development and disease. Beyond identifying several well characterised dye-filling genes, our approach uncovered three genes not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function. From these putative novel dye-filling genes, we confirmed the involvement of BGNT-1.1 in ciliated sensory neuron function and morphogenesis. BGNT-1.1 functions at the trans-Golgi network of sheath cells (glia) to influence dye-filling and cilium length, in a cell non-autonomous manner. Notably, BGNT-1.1 is the orthologue of human B3GNT1/B4GAT1, a glycosyltransferase associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS). WWS is a multigenic disorder characterised by muscular dystrophy as well as brain and eye anomalies. Together, our work unveils an effective and innovative approach to gene discovery, and provides the first evidence that B3GNT1-associated Walker-Warburg syndrome may be considered a ciliopathy.\n\nAuthor SummaryModel organisms are useful tools for uncovering new genes involved in a biological process via genetic screens. Such an approach is powerful, but suffers from drawbacks that can slow down gene discovery. In forward genetics screens, difficult-to-map phenotypes present daunting challenges, and whole-genome coverage can be equally challenging for reverse genetic screens where typically only a single genes function is assayed per strain. Here, we show a different approach which includes positive aspects of forward (high-coverage, randomly-induced mutations) and reverse genetics (prior knowledge of gene disruption) to accelerate gene discovery. We paired a whole-genome sequenced multi-mutation C. elegans library with a rare-variant associated test to rapidly identify genes associated with a phenotype of interest: defects in sensory neurons bearing sensory organelles called cilia, via a simple dye-filling assay to probe the form and function of these cells. We found two well characterised dye-filling genes and three genes, not previously linked to ciliated sensory neuron development or function, that were associated with dye-filling defects. We reveal that disruption of one of these (BGNT-1.1), whose human orthologue is associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome, results in abrogated uptake of dye and cilia length defects. We believe that our novel approach is useful for any organism with a small genome that can be quickly sequenced and where many mutant strains can be easily isolated and phenotyped, such as Drosophila and Arabidopsis."
10.1101/027516,"Many complex brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, exhibit a wide range of symptoms and disability. To understand how brain communication is impaired in such conditions, functional connectivity studies seek to understand individual differences in brain network structure in terms of covariates that measure symptom severity. In practice, however, functional connectivity is not observed but estimated from complex and noisy neural activity measurements. Imperfect subject network estimates can compromise subsequent efforts to detect covariate effects on network structure. We address this problem in the case of Gaussian graphical models of functional connectivity, by proposing novel two-level models that treat both subject level networks and population level covariate effects as unknown parameters. To account for imperfectly estimated subject level networks when fitting these models, we propose two related approaches -- R2 based on resampling and random effects test statistics, and R3 that additionally employs random adaptive penalization. Simulation studies using realistic graph structures reveal that R2 and R3 have superior statistical power to detect covariate effects compared to existing approaches, particularly when the number of within subject observations is comparable to the size of subject networks. Using our novel models and methods to study parts of the ABIDE dataset, we find evidence of hypoconnectivity associated with symptom severity in autism spectrum disorders, in frontoparietal and limbic systems as well as in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices."
10.1101/027532,"The Atlantic Canary (Serinus canaria) is the most common caged bird with extensive carotenoid plumage coloration. Domestic strains of canaries have been bred for a range of colors and patterns, making them a valuable model for studies of the genetic bases for feather pigmentation. However, no detailed account has been published on the feather pigments of the various strains of this species, particularly in relation to dietary pigments available during molt. Moreover, in the twentieth century, aviculturists created a red canary by crossing Atlantic Canaries with Red Siskins (Carduelis cucullata). This \""red-factor\"" canary is reputed to metabolically transform yellow dietary pigments into red ketocarotenoids, but such metabolic capacity has yet to be documented in controlled experiments. We fed molting yellow and red-factor canaries seed diets supplemented with either {beta}-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, or {beta}-cryptoxanthin/{beta}-carotene and measured the coloration and carotenoid content of newly grown feathers. On all diets, yellow canaries grew yellow feathers and red canaries grew red feathers. Yellow canaries deposited dietary pigments and metabolically derived canary xanthophylls into feathers. Red-factor canaries deposited the same plumage carotenoids as yellow canaries, but also deposited red ketocarotenoids. Red-factor canaries deposited higher total amounts of carotenoids than yellow canaries, but otherwise there was little effect of diet treatment on feather hue or chroma. These observations indicate that canaries can use a variety of dietary precursors to produce plumage coloration and that red canaries can metabolically convert yellow dietary carotenoids into red ketocarotenoids."
10.1101/027599,"Diversification rates are estimated from phylogenies, typically without fossils, except in paleontological studies. By nature, rate estimations depend heavily on the time data provided in phylogenies, which are divergence times and (when used) fossil ages. Among these temporal data, fossil ages are by far the most precisely known (divergence times are inferences calibrated with fossils). We propose a method to compute the likelihood of a phylogenetic tree with fossils in which the only known time information is the fossil ages.\n\nTesting our approach on simulated data shows that the maximum likelihood rate estimates from the phylogenetic tree shape and the fossil dates are almost as accurate as the ones obtained by taking into account all the data, including the divergence times. Moreover they are substantially more accurate than the estimates obtained only from the exact divergence times (without taking into account the fossil record)."
10.1101/027581,"Many key bacterial pathogens are frequently carried asymptomatically, and the emergence and spread of these opportunistic pathogens can be driven, or mitigated, via demographic changes within the host population. These inter-host transmission dynamics combine with basic evolutionary parameters such as rates of mutation and recombination, population size and selection, to shape the genetic diversity within bacterial populations. Whilst many studies have focused on how molecular processes underpin bacterial population structure, the impact of host migration and the connectivity of the local populations has received far less attention. A stochastic neutral model incorporating heightened local transmission has been previously shown to fit closely with genetic data for several bacterial species. However, this model did not incorporate transmission limiting population stratification, nor the possibility of migration of strains between subpopulations, which we address here by presenting an extended model. The model captures the observed population patterns for the common nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium display deviations attributable to adaptation. It is demonstrated analytically and numerically that expected strain relatedness may either increase or decrease as a function of increasing migration rate between subpopulations, being a complex function of the rate at which microepidemics occur in the metapopulation. Moreover, it is shown that in a structured population markedly different rates of evolution may lead to indistinguishable patterns of relatedness among bacterial strains; caution is thus required when drawing evolution inference in these cases."
10.1101/027607,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is increasingly being used for broad applications of microbial characterization, such as microbial ecology, clinical diagnosis, and outbreak epidemiology. However, the analytical task of comparing short sequence reads against the known diversity of microbial life has proved to be computationally challenging. The One Codex data platform was created with the dual goals of analyzing microbial data against the largest possible collection of microbial reference genomes, as well as presenting those results in a format that is consumable by applied end-users. One Codex identifies microbial sequences using a \""k-mer based\"" taxonomic classification algorithm through a web-based data platform, using a reference database that currently includes approximately 40,000 bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan genomes. In order to evaluate whether this classification method and associated database provided quantitatively different performance for microbial identification, we created a large and diverse evaluation dataset containing 50 million reads from 10,639 genomes, as well as sequences from six organisms novel species not be included in the reference databases of any of the tested classifiers. Quantitative evaluation of several published microbial detection methods shows that One Codex has the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.97, compared to 0.82-0.88 for other methods), both when detecting well-characterized species as well as newly sequenced, \""taxonomically novel\"" organisms."
10.1101/027524,"Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order of accumulation of genetic alterations during cancer development. Algorithms to infer such models from the currently available mutational profiles collected from different cancer patiens (cross-sectional data) have been defined in the literature since late 90s. These algorithms differ in the way they extract a graphical model of the events modelling the progression, e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations.\n\nTRONCO is an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a serie of functions to assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular, it implements algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by means of the notion of selective advantage.

10.1101/027631,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of /{beta}-tubulin are believed to regulate interactions with microtubule binding proteins. A well-characterized PTM involves the removal and re-ligation of the C-terminal tyrosine on -tubulin, but the purpose of this tyrosination-detyrosination cycle remains elusive. Here, we examined the processive motility of mammalian dynein complexed with dynactin and BicD2 (DDB) on tyrosinated versus detyrosinated microtubules. Motility was decreased ~4-fold on detyrosinated microtubules, constituting the largest effect of a tubulin PTM on motor function observed to date. This preference is mediated by dynactins microtubule binding p150 subunit rather than dynein itself. Interestingly, on chimeric microtubules, DDB molecules that initiated movement on tyrosinated tubulin continued moving into a region of detyrosinated tubulin. This result indicates that the -tubulin tyrosine facilitates initial motor-tubulin encounters, but is not needed for subsequent motility. Our results reveal a strong effect of the C-terminal -tubulin tyrosine on dynein-dynactin motility and suggest that the tubulin tyrosination cycle could modulate the initiation of dynein-driven motility in cells."
10.1101/027706,"Behavioral flexibility is considered an important trait for adapting to environmental change, but it is unclear what it is, how it works, and whether it is a problem solving ability. I investigated behavioral flexibility and problem solving abilities experimentally in great-tailed grackles, an invasive species and thus a likely candidate for possessing behavioral flexibility. I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies. It appears that behavioral flexibility can be an independent trait that varies across contexts. Maintaining such a high level of variation could be a mechanism underlying successful species invasions. These results highlight the need to investigate how individuals use behavior to react to changing environments."
10.1101/027649,"Evolutionary innovation must occur in the context of some genomic background, which limits available evolutionary paths. For example, protein evolution by sequence substitution is constrained by epistasis between residues. In prokaryotes, evolutionary innovation frequently happens by macrogenomic events such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Previous work has suggested that HGT can be influenced by ancestral genomic content, yet the extent of such gene-level constraints has not yet been systematically characterized. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary impact of such constraints in prokaryotes, using probabilistic ancestral reconstructions from 634 extant prokaryotic genomes and a novel framework for detecting evolutionary constraints on HGT events. We identified 8,228 directional dependencies between genes, and demonstrated that many such dependencies reflect known functional relationships, including, for example, evolutionary dependencies of the photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO. Modeling all dependencies as a network, we adapted an approach from graph theory to establish chronological precedence in the acquisition of different genomic functions. Specifically, we demonstrated that specific functions tend to be gained sequentially, suggesting that evolution in prokaryotes is governed by functional assembly patterns. Finally, we showed that these dependencies are universal rather than clade-specific and are often sufficient for predicting whether or not a given ancestral genome will acquire specific genes. Combined, our results indicate that evolutionary innovation via HGT is profoundly constrained by epistasis and historical contingency, similar to the evolution of proteins and phenotypic characters, and suggest that the emergence of specific metabolic and pathological phenotypes in prokaryotes can be predictable from current genomes."
10.1101/027656,"In this study, an Escherichia coli (E. coli) based transcription translation cell-free system (TX-TL) was employed to sample various enzyme expression levels of the violacein pathway. The pathway was successfully reconstructed in TX-TL. Its variation produced different metabolites as evident from the extracts assorted colors. Analysis of the violacein product via UV-Vis absorption and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detected 68 ng of violacein per l reaction volume. Significant buildup of prodeoxyviolacein intermediate was also detected in the equimolar TX-TL reaction. Finally, design space exploration experiments suggested an improvement in violacein production at high VioC and VioD DNA concentrations."
10.1101/027664,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing by providing unprecedented DNA-targeting specificity. Here we demonstrate that this system can be applied to facilitate efficient plasmid selection for transformation as well as selective gene insertion into plasmid vectors by cleaving unwanted plasmid byproducts after restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Using fluorescent and chromogenic proteins as reporters, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage excludes unwanted ligation byproducts and increases transformation efficiency of desired inserts from 20% up to 97% {+/-} 3%. This CRISPR/Cas9-Assisted Transformation-Efficient Reaction (CRATER) protocol is a novel, inexpensive, and convenient method for obtaining specific cloning products."
10.1101/027680,"Studies of a cell rely on either observational approaches or perturbational/genetic approaches to define the contribution of a gene to specific cellular traits. It is unclear, however, under what circumstances each of the two approaches can be most successful and when they are doomed to fail. By analyzing over 500 complex traits of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that the trait relatedness to fitness determines the performance of observational approaches. Specifically, in traits subject to strong natural selection, genes identified using observational approaches are often highly coordinated in expression, such that the gene-trait associations are readily recognizable; in sharp contrast, the lack of such coordination in traits subject to weak selection leads to no detectable activity-trait associations for any individual genes and thus the failure of observational approaches. We further show that genetic approaches can be successful when the genes responsible for coordinating the target genes of observational approaches are perturbed. However, because the system-level cellular responses to a random mutation affect more or less every gene and consequently every trait, most genetic effects convey no trait-specific functional information for understanding the traits, which is particularly true for traits subject to weak selection.\n\nSignificance statementCell research is nearly exclusively based on empirical data obtained through either observational approaches or perturbational/genetic approaches. It is, however, increasingly clear that an analytical framework able to guide the empirical strategies is necessary to drive the field further ahead. This study analyzes ~500 complex traits of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and reveals the organizing principles of a cell. Specifically, a cell can be viewed as a factory, with each trait being the product of a production line operated directly by workers who are supervised by managers. For a cellular trait produced by many workers, the coordination level of the workers determines the performance of observational approaches. Meanwhile, the coordination of workers is realized by managers that are recruited and/or maintained by natural selection. Thus, observational approaches are expected to fail for traits subject to little selection, and genetic approaches can be successful only when the managers of fitness-tightly-coupled traits are perturbed. The manager-worker architecture built by natural selection explains well the origins of global epistasis and ubiquitous genetic effects, two major issues confusing current genetics and molecular and cellular biology, providing a clear guideline on how to study a cell."
10.1101/027714,"As part of the Cambrian explosion of omics data, metagenomics brings to the table a specific, defining trait: its social essence. The meta prefix exerts its influence, with multitudes manifesting themselves everywhere; from samples to data analysis, from actors involved to (present and future) applications. Of these dimensions, data analysis is where needs lay further from what current tools provide. Key features are, among others, scalability, reproducibility, data provenance and distribution, process identity and versioning. These are the goals guiding our work in MG7, a 16S metagenomics data analysis system. The basic principle is a new approach to data analysis, where configuration, processes, or data locations are static, type-checked and subject to the standard evolution of a well-maintained software project. Cloud computing, in its Amazon Web Services incarnation, when coupled with these ideas, produces a robust, safely configurable, scalable tool. Processes, data, machine behaviors and their dependencies are expressed using a set of libraries which bring as much as possible checking and validation to the type level, without sacrificing expressiveness. Together they form a toolkit for defining scalable cloud-based workflows composed of stateless computations, with a static reproducible specification of dependencies, behavior and wiring of all steps. The modeling of taxonomy data is done using Bio4j, where the new paradigm of graph databases allows for both a simple expression of taxonomic assignment tasks and the calculation of taxa abundance values considering the hierarchic structure of the taxonomy tree. MG7 includes a new 16S reference database, 16S-DB7, built with a flexible and sustainable update system, and the possibility of project-driven personalization."
10.1101/027425,"The origin of nervous systems has traditionally been discussed within two conceptual frameworks. Input-output models stress the sensory-motor aspects of nervous systems, while internal coordination models emphasize the role of nervous systems in coordinating multicellular activity, especially muscle-based motility. Here we consider both frameworks and apply them to describe aspects of each of three main groups of phenomena that nervous systems control: behavior, physiology and development. We argue that both frameworks and all three aspects of nervous system function need to be considered for a comprehensive discussion of nervous system origins. This broad mapping of the option space enables an overview of the many influences and constraints that may have played a role in the evolution of the first nervous systems."

10.1101/027243,"Sirtuin enzymes are NAD+-dependent protein deacylases that play a central role in the regulation of healthspan and lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. There is intense interest in the activation of the seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) in order to extend mammalian healthspan and lifespan. However, there is currently no understanding of how to design sirtuin-activating compounds beyond allosteric activators of SIRT1-catalyzed reactions that are limited to particular substrates. Moreover, across all families of enzymes, only a dozen or so distinct classes of non-natural small molecule activators have been characterized, with only four known modes of activation among them. None of these modes of activation are based on the unique catalytic reaction mechanisms of the target enzymes. Here, we report a general mode of sirtuin activation that is distinct from the known modes of enzyme activation. Based on the conserved mechanism of sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reactions, we establish biophysical properties of small molecule modulators that can in principle result in enzyme activation for diverse sirtuins and substrates. Building upon this framework, we propose strategies for the identification, characterization and evolution of hits for mechanism-based enzyme activating compounds. We characterize several small molecules reported in the literature to activate sirtuins besides SIRT1, using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques including label-free and labeled kinetic and thermodynamic assays with multiple substrates and protocols for the identification of false positives. We provide evidence indicating that several of these small molecules reported in the published literature are false positives, and identify others as hit compounds for the design of compounds that can activate sirtuins through the proposed mechanism-based mode of action."
10.1101/027755,"One of the major properties of genes is their expression pattern. Notably, genes are often classified as tissue-specific or housekeeping. This property is of interest to molecular evolution as an explanatory factor of, e.g., evolutionary rate, as well as a functional feature which may in itself evolve. While many different methods of measuring tissue specificity have been proposed and used for such studies, there has been no comparison or benchmarking of these methods to our knowledge, and little justification of their use. In this study we compare nine measures of tissue-specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq. We analyze their capacity to distinguish gene categories, their robustness to the choice and number of tissues used, and their capture of evolutionary conservation signal."
10.1101/027730,"In 2014, it was reported that strong external stimuli, such as a transient low-pH stressor, was capable of inducing the reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells (Obokata et al. 2014a, b). This cellular reprograming event was designated  stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) by the authors of these reports. However, after multiple instances of scientific misconduct in the handling and presentation of the data were brought to light, both reports were retracted. To investigate the actual scientific significance of the purported STAP phenomenon, we sought to repeat the original experiments based on the methods presented in the retracted manuscripts and other relevant information. As a result, we have confirmed that the STAP phenomenon as described in the original studies is not reproducible."
10.1101/027722,"A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the \""conservative transitions\"" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias."
10.1101/027763,"Conserved, ultraconserved and other classes of constrained non-coding elements (referred as CNEs) represent one of the mysteries of current comparative genomics. These elements are defined using various degrees of sequence similarity between organisms and several thresholds of minimal length and are often marked by extreme conservation that frequently exceeds the one observed for protein-coding sequences. We here explore the distribution of different classes of CNEs in entire chromosomes, in the human genome. We employ two complementary methodologies, the scaling of block entropy and box-counting, with the aim to assess fractal characteristics of different CNE datasets. Both approaches converge to the conclusion that well-developed fractality is characteristic of elements that are either marked by extreme conservation between two or more organisms or are of ancient origin, i.e. conserved between distant organisms across evolution. Given that CNEs are often clustered around genes, especially those that regulate developmental processes, we verify by appropriate gene masking that fractal-like patterns emerge irrespectively of whether elements found in proximity or inside genes are excluded or not. An evolutionary scenario is proposed, involving genomic events, that might account for fractal distribution of CNEs in the human genome as indicated through numerical simulations."

Finding hidden relationships in complex data is now possible through the use of massive computational power, particularly by means of Artificial Intelligence methods, such as evolutionary computation.\nC_LIO_LIHere we use symbolic regression (SR), which searches for both the formal structure of equations and the fitting parameters simultaneously, hence providing the required flexibility to characterize complex ecological systems.\nC_LIO_LIFirst, we demonstrate how SR can deal with complex datasets for: 1) modelling species richness; and 2) modelling species spatial distributions. Second, we illustrate how SR can be used to find general models in ecology, by using it to: 3) develop species richness estimators; and 4) develop the species-area relationship and the general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography.\nC_LIO_LIAll the examples suggest that evolving free-form equations purely from data, often without prior human inference or hypotheses, may represent a very powerful tool for ecologists and biogeographers to become aware of hidden relationships and suggest general theoretical models and principles.\nC_LI"
10.1101/027821,"O_LIThe open-access scientific philosophy has been widely adopted and proven to promote considerable progress in the fields of ecology and evolution. Openaccess global databases now exist on animal migration, the distribution of species, and conservation status, to mention a few. However, a gap exists for databases on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment. Furthermore, an animal populations schedules of reproduction and mortality determine its invasive potential, and its risk of local extinction, which are at the core of conservation biology.\nC_LIO_LIMatrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics in terms of reproduction, mortality, and development over the entire life cycle. The results of MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens.\nC_LIO_LIThousand of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult.

10.1101/027813,"Biodiversity loss is a global problem and island species/populations are particularly vulnerable to such loss. Low genetic diversity is one of the factors that can lead a population to extinction. Loss of bee populations is of particular concern because of the knock-on consequences for the pollination guilds that the lost bees once serviced. Here we evaluate the genetic structure of the bumble bee Bombus morio populations on the mainland of South East Brazil and on nearby islands. We analyzed a total of 659 individuals from 24 populations by sequencing two mitochondrial genes (COI and Cytb) and using 14 microsatellite loci. Levels of diversity were high in most of populations and were similar on islands and the mainland. Furthermore, genetic diversity was not significantly correlated with island area, although it was lower in populations from distant islands. Our data suggest that long-term isolation on islands is not affecting the population viability of this species. This may be attributed to the high dispersal ability of B. morio, its capacity to suvive in urban environments, and the characteristics of the studied islands."
10.1101/027771,"Almost all genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can be found in the general population, but the effects of that risk are unclear in people not ascertained for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Using several large ASD consortia and population based resources, we find genetic links between ASDs and typical variation in social behavior and adaptive functioning. This finding is evidenced through both inherited and de novo variation, indicating that multiple types of genetic risk for ASDs influence a continuum of behavioral and developmental traits, the severe tail of which can result in an ASD or other neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis. A continuum model should inform the design and interpretation of studies of neuropsychiatric disease biology."
10.1101/027797,"The Chlamydomonas genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to produce a rich resource for genetics and molecular biology in this well-studied model organism. The annotated genome is very rich in open reading frames upstream of the annotated coding sequence ( uORFs): almost three quarters of the assigned transcripts have at least one uORF, and frequently more than one. This is problematic with respect to the standard  scanning model for eukaryotic translation initiation. These uORFs can be grouped into three classes: class 1, initiating in-frame with the coding sequence (cds) (thus providing a potential in-frame N-terminal extension); class 2, initiating in the 5UT and terminating out-of-frame in the cds; and class 3, initiating and terminating within the 5UT. Multiple bioinformatics criteria (including analysis of Kozak consensus sequence agreement and BLASTP comparisons to the closely related Volvox genome, and statistical comparison to cds and to random-sequence controls) indicate that of ~4000 class 1 uORFs, approximately half are likely in vivo translation initiation sites. The proposed resulting N-terminal extensions in many cases will sharply alter the predicted biochemical properties of the encoded proteins. These results suggest significant modifications in ~2000 of the ~20,000 transcript models with respect to translation initiation and encoded peptides. In contrast, class 2 uORFs may be subject to purifying selection, and the existent ones (surviving selection) are likely inefficiently translated. Class 3 uORFs are remarkably similar to random sequence expectations with respect to size, number and composition and therefore may be largely selectively neutral; their very high abundance (found in more than half of transcripts, frequently with multiple uORFs per transcript) nevertheless suggests the possibility of translational regulation on a wide scale."
10.1101/027789,"ATRX is a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler proposed to govern genomic stability through the regulation of repetitive sequences such as rDNA, retrotransposons, and pericentromeric and telomeric repeats. However, few direct ATRX target genes have been identified and high-throughput genomic approaches are currently lacking for ATRX. Here we present a comprehensive ChIP-sequencing study of ATRX in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562, in which we identify the 3 exons of zinc finger genes (ZNFs) as a new class of ATRX targets. These 3 exonic regions encode the zinc finger motifs, which can range from 1-40 copies per ZNF gene and share large stretches of sequence similarity. These regions often contain an atypical chromatin signature: they are transcriptionally active, contain high levels of H3K36me3 and are paradoxically enriched in H3K9me3. We find that these ZNF 3 exons are also co-occupied by SETDB1, TRIM28 and ZNF274. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function studies demonstrate a significant reduction of H3K9me3 at the ZNF 3 exons in the absence of ATRX and that H3K9me3 levels at atypical chromatin regions are particularly sensitive to ATRX loss compared to other H3K9me3-occupied regions. As ZNFs are one of the most rapidly expanding gene families in primates and genomic rearrangements are believed to be responsible for ZNF duplications, our results suggest that ATRX binds to the 3 exons of ZNFs to maintain their genomic stability through preservation of H3K9me3."
10.1101/027805,"Transcriptome studies based on quantitative sequencing estimate gene expression levels by measuring the abundance of target RNAs in libraries of sequence reads. The sequencing cost is proportional to the total number of sequenced reads. Therefore, in order to cover rare RNAs, considerable quantities of abundant and identical reads have to be sequenced. This major limitation can be lifted by strategies used to deplete the library from some of the most abundant sequences. However, these strategies involve either an extra handling of the input RNA sample, or the use of a large number of reverse-transcription primers (termed \""not-so-random primers\""), which are costly to synthetize and customize. Here, we demonstrate that with a precise selection of only 40 \""pseudo-random\"" reverse-transcription primers, it is possible to decrease the rate of undesirable abundant sequences within a library without affecting the transcriptome diversity. \""Pseudo-random\"" primers are simple to design, and therefore are a flexible tool for enriching transcriptome libraries in rare transcripts sequences."
10.1101/027847,"Many of the characteristics associated with mammalian sleep are also observed in Drosophila, making the fruit-fly a powerful model organism for studying the genetics of this important process. Among these similarities is the presence of sexual dimorphic sleep patterns, which in flies, is manifested as increased mid-day sleep ( siesta) in males, compared to females. Here, we have used targeted miss-expression of the gene transformer (tra) and tra2 to either feminise or masculinise specific neural and non-neural tissues in the fly. Feminization of males using three different GAL4 drivers which are expressed in the mushroom bodies induced a female-like reduced siesta, while the masculinisation of females using these drivers triggered the male-like increased siesta. We also observed a similar reversal of sex-specific sleep by miss-expressing tra in the fat body, a key tissue in energy metabolism and hormone secretion. In addition, the daily expression levels of takeout, an important circadian clock output gene, were sexually dimorphic. Taken together, our experiments suggest that sleep-sexual dimorphism in Drosophila is driven by multiple neural and non-neural circuits, within and outside the brain."
10.1101/027995,"Antigenic sites in viral pathogens exhibit distinctive evolutionary dynamics due to their role in evading recognition by host immunity. Antigenic selection is known to drive higher rates of non-synonymous substitution; less well understood is why differences are observed between viruses in their propensity to mutate to a novel or previously encountered amino acid. Here, we present a model to explain patterns of antigenic reversion and forward substitution in terms of the epidemiological and molecular processes of the viral population. We develop an analytical three-strain model and extend the analysis to a multi-site model to predict characteristics of observed sequence samples. Our model provides insight into how the balance between selection to escape immunity and to maintain viability is affected by the rate of mutational input. We also show that while low probabilities of reversion may be due to either a low cost of immune escape or slowly decaying host immunity, these two scenarios can be differentiated by the frequency patterns at antigenic sites. Comparison between frequency patterns of human influenza A (H3N2) and human RSV-A suggests that the increased rates of antigenic reversion in RSV-A is due to faster decaying immunity and not higher costs of escape."
10.1101/027953,"The combinatorial binding of trans-acting factors (TFs) to regulatory genomic regions is an important basis for the spatial and temporal specificity of gene regulation. We present a new computational approach that reveals how TFs are organized into combinatorial regulatory programs. We define a regulatory program to be a set of TFs that bind together at a regulatory region. Unlike other approaches to characterizing TF binding, we permit a regulatory region to be bound by one or more regulatory programs. We have developed a method called regulatory program discovery (RPD) that produces compact and coherent regulatory programs from in vivo binding data using a topic model. Using RPD we find that the binding of 115 TFs in K562 cells can be organized into 49 interpretable regulatory programs that bind ~140,000 distinct regulatory regions in a modular manner. The discovered regulatory programs recapitulate many published protein-protein physical interactions and have consistent functional annotations of chromatin states. We found that, for certain TFs, direct (motif present) and indirect (motif absent) binding is characterized by distinct sets of binding partners and that the binding of other TFs can predict whether the TF binds directly or indirectly with high accuracy. Joint analysis across two cell types reveals both cell-type-specific and shared regulatory programs and that thousands of regulatory regions use different programs in different cell types. Overall, our results provide comprehensive cell-type-specific combinatorial binding maps and suggest a modular organization of binding programs in regulatory regions."
10.1101/027938,"Ribosome profiling produces snapshots of the locations of actively translating ribosomes on messenger RNAs. These snapshots can be used to make inferences about translation dynamics. Recent ribosome profiling studies in yeast, however, have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the average translation rate of each codon. Some experiments have used cycloheximide (CHX) to stabilize ribosomes before measuring their positions, and these studies all counterintuitively report a weak negative correlation between the translation rate of a codon and the abundance of its cognate tRNA. In contrast, some experiments performed without CHX report strong positive correlations. To explain this contradiction, we identify unexpected patterns in ribosome density downstream of each type of codon in experiments that use CHX. These patterns are evidence that elongation continues to occur in the presence of CHX but with dramatically altered codon-specific elongation rates. The measured positions of ribosomes in these experiments therefore do not reflect the amounts of time ribosomes spend at each position in vivo. These results suggest that conclusions from experiments in yeast using CHX may need reexamination. In particular, we show that in all such experiments, codons decoded by less abundant tRNAs were in fact being translated more slowly before the addition of CHX disrupted these dynamics."
10.1101/027854,"Recent insights into the human microbiome offer the hope of manipulating its composition to help fight infectious diseases1-7. While this strategy has shown huge potential, its consequences for pathogen evolution have not been explored. Here we show that manipulating the microbiome to increase the competition that pathogens face could lead to the evolution of increased production of virulence factors that pathogens use to combat commensals, an evolutionary response that can increase total disease induced mortality in the long-term. However, if treatment with microbiome engineering is sufficiently aggressive this evolutionary response can be avoided and the pathogen eradicated. Furthermore, we show that using damage limitation therapies8 (e.g. antivirulence and anti-inflammatory drugs) in combination with microbiome manipulation increases the potential for pathogen eradication. While manipulating our microbiota offers a promising alternative to antibiotics, our results show that these treatments must be designed with careful consideration of the potential evolutionary responses of target pathogens."
10.1101/027896,"While most ectotherms thermotax only to regulate their temperature, female mosquitoes are attracted to human body heat during pursuit of a blood meal. Here we elucidate the basic rules of Aedes aegypti thermotaxis and test the function of candidate thermoreceptors in this important behavior. We show that host-seeking mosquitoes are maximally attracted to thermal stimuli approximating host body temperatures, seeking relative warmth while avoiding both relative cooling and stimuli exceeding host body temperature. We found that the cation channel TRPA1, in addition to playing a conserved role in thermoregulation and chemosensation, is required for this specialized host-selective thermotaxis in mosquitoes. During host-seeking, AaegTRPA1-/- mutants failed to avoid stimuli exceeding host temperature, and were unable to discriminate between host-temperature and high-temperature stimuli. TRPA1-dependent tuning of thermotaxis is likely critical for mosquitoes host-seeking in a complex thermal environment in which humans are warmer than ambient air, but cooler than surrounding sun-warmed surfaces."
10.1101/027870,"The significance of single-cell transcription resides not only in the cumulative expression strength of the cell population but also in its heterogeneity.

Transcriptional  co-bursting - governed by distinct mechanisms during myoblast proliferation and differentiation - is described here."

10.1101/027961,"During his well-known debate with Fisher regarding the phenotypic dataset of Panaxia dominula, Wright (1948) suggested fluctuating selection as a potential explanation for the observed change in frequency. This model has since been invoked in a number of analyses, with the focus of discussion centering mainly on random or oscillatory fluctuations of selection intensities. Here, we present a novel method to consider non-random changes in selection intensities using Wright-Fisher approximate Bayesian (ABC)-based approaches, in order to detect and evaluate a change in selection strength from time-sampled data. This novel method jointly estimates the position of a change point as well as the strength of both corresponding selection coefficients (and dominance for diploid cases) from the allele trajectory. The simulation studies of CP-WFABC reveal the combinations of parameter ranges and input values that optimize performance, thus indicating optimal experimental design strategies. We apply this approach to both the historical dataset of Panaxia dominula in order to shed light on this historical debate, as well as to whole-genome time-serial data from influenza virus in order to identify sites with changing selection intensities in response to drug treatment"
10.1101/028001,"Study question: How does a genetic variant altering follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which we identified as associated with length of menstrual cycle, more widely impact reproductive health?\n\nSummary answer: The T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) results in longer menstrual cycles and later menopause and, while having detrimental effects on fertility, is protective against endometriosis.\n\nWhat is known already: The FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) affects levels of FSHB transcription and, as a result, levels of FSH. FSH is required for normal fertility and genetic variants at the FSHB locus are associated with age at menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nStudy design, size, duration: We conducted a genetic association study using cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank.\n\nParticipants/materials, setting, methods: We included white British individuals aged 40-69 years in 2006-2010, included in the May 2015 release of genetic data from UK Biobank. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 9,534 individuals to identify genetic variants associated with length of menstrual cycle. We tested the FSH lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) for associations with 29 reproductive phenotypes in up to 63,350 individuals.\n\nMain results and the role of chance: In the GWAS for menstrual cycle length, only variants near the FSHB gene reached genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8). The FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638G>T; MAF 0.16) was associated with longer menstrual cycles (0.16 s.d. (approx. 1 day) per minor allele; 95% CI 0.12-0.20; P=6x10-16), later age at menopause (0.13 years per minor allele; 95% CI 0.04-0.22; P=5.7x10-3), greater female nulliparity (OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.11; P=4.8x10-3) and lower risk of endometriosis (OR=0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.90; P=4.1x10-4). The FSH-lowering T allele was not associated more generally with other reproductive illnesses or conditions and we did not replicate associations with male infertility or PCOS.\n\nLimitations, reasons for caution: The data included might be affected by recall bias. Women with a cycle length recorded were aged over 40 and were approaching menopause, however we did not find evidence that this affected the results. Many of the illnesses had relatively small sample sizes and so we may have been under-powered to detect an effect.\n\nWider implications of the findings: We found a strong novel association between a genetic variant that lowers FSH levels and longer menstrual cycles, at a locus previously robustly associated with age at menopause. The variant was also associated with nulliparity and endometriosis risk. We conclude that lifetime differences in circulating levels of FSH between individuals can influence menstrual cycle length and a range of reproductive outcomes, including menopause timing, infertility, endometriosis and PCOS."
10.1101/028019,"Gene products (RNAs, proteins) often occur at low molecular counts inside individual cells, and hence are subject to considerable random fluctuations (noise) in copy number over time. Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse regulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent feedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an upstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein Y. Thus, any random increase in Xs copy numbers would increase both production and degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics, we formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master Equation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Ys production and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Ys copy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y propagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is introduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases with noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is invariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the time-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream processes. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from noise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes in the time-scale of fluctuations."
10.1101/027946,"Actin remodeling is indispensable for dendritic spine development, morphology and density which signify learning, memory and motor skills. CAP2 is a regulator of actin dynamics through sequestering G-actin and severing F-actin. In a mouse model, ablation of CAP2 leads to cardiovascular defects and delayed wound healing. This report investigates the role of CAP2 in the brain using Cap2gt/gt mice. Dendritic spine density and neuronal dendritic length were altered in Cap2gt/gt. This was accompanied by increased F-actin content and F-actin accumulation in cultured Cap2gt/gt neurons. In membrane depolarization assays, Cap2gt/gt synaptosomes exhibit an impaired F/G actin ratio, indicating altered actin dynamics. We show an interaction between CAP2 and n-cofilin, presumably mediated through the C-terminal domain of CAP2 and is cofilin ser3 phosphorylation dependent. In vivo, the consequences of this interaction were altered phosphorylated cofilin levels and formation of cofilin aggregates in the neurons. Thus, our studies identify a novel role of CAP2 in neuronal development and neuronal actin dynamics."
10.1101/027920,"Odors elicit complex patterns of activated olfactory sensory neurons. Knowing the complete olfactome, i.e. responses in all sensory neurons for all odorants, is desirable to understand olfactory coding. The DoOR project combines all available Drosophila odorant response data into a single consensus response matrix. Since its first release many studies were published: receptors were deorphanized and several response profiles were expanded. In this study, we add to the odor-response profiles for four odorant receptors (Or10a, Or42b, Or47b, Or56a). We deorphanize Or69a, showing a broad response spectrum with the best ligands including 3-hydroxyhexanoate, alpha-terpineol, 3-octanol and linalool.

Recent progress in genomics has enabled the de novo decoding of the genome of virtually any organism, greatly expanding its potential for understanding the biology and evolution of the full spectrum of biodiversity. The increasing diversity of sequencing technologies, assays, and de novo assembly algorithms have augmented the complexity of de novo genome sequencing projects in non-model organisms. To reduce the costs and challenges in de novo genome sequencing projects and streamline their experimental design and analysis, we developed iWGS (in silico Whole Genome Sequencer and Analyzer), an automated pipeline for guiding the choice of appropriate sequencing strategy and assembly protocols. iWGS seamlessly integrates the four key steps of a de novo genome sequencing project: data generation (through simulation), data quality control, de novo assembly, and assembly evaluation and validation. The last three steps can also be applied to the analysis of real data. iWGS is designed to enable the user to have great flexibility in testing the range of experimental designs available for genome sequencing projects, and supports all major sequencing technologies and popular assembly tools. Three case studies illustrate how iWGS can guide the design of de novo genome sequencing projects and evaluate the performance of a wide variety of user-specified sequencing strategies and assembly protocols on genomes of differing architectures. iWGS, along with a detailed documentation, is freely available at https://github.com/zhouxiaofan1983/iWGS."

It is hypothesized that gene expression may be influenced by the physical deformation of the nucleus in response to force. Here, using 3T3s as a model, we demonstrate that extra-cellular forces cause cell nuclei to rapidly deform (< 1 s) preferentially along their shorter nuclear axis, in an anisotropic manner. Nuclear anisotropy is shown to be regulated by the cytoskeleton within intact cells, with actin and microtubules resistant to orthonormal strains. Importantly, nuclear anisotropy is intrinsic, and observed in isolated nuclei. The sensitivity of this behaviour is influenced by chromatin organization and lamin-A expression. An anisotropic response to force was also highly conserved amongst an array of examined nuclei from differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Although the functional purpose of this conserved material property remains elusive, it may provide a mechanism through which mechanical cues in the microenvironment are rapidly transmitted to the genome."

10.1101/028175,"Given genomic variation data from multiple individuals, computing the likelihood of complex population genetic models is often infeasible. To circumvent this problem, we introduce here a novel likelihood-free inference framework by applying deep learning, a powerful modern technique in machine learning. In contrast to Approximate Bayesian Computation, another likelihood-free approach widely used in population genetics and other fields, deep learning does not require a distance function on summary statistics or a rejection step, and it is robust to the addition of uninformative statistics. To demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed to estimate population genetic parameters and learn informative features of data, we focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography (in the form of a population size change history). Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. Studying demography and selection jointly is motivated by Drosophila, where pervasive selection confounds demographic analysis. We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography, and regions of their genome under selection. We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation (soft sweep) or balancing selection. Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. In addition, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme, likely due in part to the unaccounted impact of selection."
10.1101/028043,"Recombination has essential roles in increasing genetic variability within a population and in ensuring successful meiotic events. The objective of this study is to (i) infer the population scaled recombination rate ({rho}), and (ii) identify and characterize localities of increased recombination rate for the domestic cat, Felis silvestris catus. SNPs (n = 701) were genotyped in twenty-two cats of Eastern random bred origin. The SNPs covered ten different chromosomal regions (A1, A2, B3, C2, D1, D2, D4, E2, F2, X) with an average region size of 850 Kb and an average SNP density of 70 SNPs/region. The Bayesian method in the program inferRho was used to infer regional population recombination rates and hotspots localities. The regions exhibited variable population recombination rates and four decisive recombination hotspots were identified on cat chromosome A2, D1, and E2 regions. No correlation was detected between the GC content and the locality of recombination spots. The hotspots enclosed L2 LINE elements and MIR and tRNA-Lys SINE elements in agreement with hotspots found in other mammals."
10.1101/028035,"A recent paper by Aschard et al described the potential for \""collider bias\"" when adjusting for heritable covariates in genetic association studies1. However, in their examples the authors acknowledged that they could not exclude the possibility of a true biological explanation for the genetic association seen only in the adjusted model. Furthermore, the extent to which this bias could create a completely spurious genetic association, rather than just modify the magnitude of the effect,2 remains unclear.\n\nCollider bias describes the artificial association created between two uncorrelated exposures (A and B) when a shared outcome (X) is included in the model as a covariate (Figure 1). We sought to definitively illustrate collider bias by deliberately inducing it to generate a biologically implausible SNP-phenotype association. Both sex (A) and autosomal genetic determinants ..."
10.1101/028068,"Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) is a state-of-the art method for profiling chromosomal interactions involving targeted regions of interest (such as gene promoters) globally and at high resolution. Signal detection in CHi-C data involves a number of statistical challenges that are not observed when using other Hi-C-like techniques. We present a background model, and algorithms for normalisation and multiple testing that are specifically adapted to CHi-C experiments, in which many spatially dispersed regions are captured, such as in Promoter CHi-C. We implement these procedures in CHiCAGO (http://regulatorygenomicsgroup.org/chicago), an open-source package for robust interaction detection in CHi-C. We validate CHiCAGO by showing that promoter-interacting regions detected with this method are enriched for regulatory features and disease-associated SNPs."
10.1101/028209,Two species with similar resource requirements respond in a characteristic way to variations in their habitat - their abundances rise and fall in concert. We use this idea to learn how bacterial populations in the microbiota respond to habitat conditions that vary from person-to-person across the human population. Our mathematical framework shows that habitat fluctuations are sufficient for explaining intra-bodysite correlations in relative species abundances from the Human Microbiome Project. We explicitly show that the relative abundances of phylogenetically related species are positively correlated and can be predicted from taxonomic relationships. We identify a small set of functional pathways related to metabolism and maintenance of the cell wall that form the basis of a common resource sharing niche space of the human microbiota.
10.1101/028076,"The response of a neuronal population over a space of inputs depends on the intrinsic properties of its constituent neurons. Two main modes of single neuron dynamics-integration and resonance-have been distinguished. While resonator cell types exist in a variety of brain areas, few models incorporate this feature and fewer have investigated its effects. To understand better how a resonators frequency preference emerges from its intrinsic dynamics and contributes to its local areas population firing rate dynamics, we analyze the dynamic gain of an analytically solvable two-degree of freedom neuron model. In the Fokker-Planck approach, the dynamic gain is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting of the voltage after a spike. This allows us to derive a complete expression for the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model in terms of a cascade of filters on the input. We find six distinct response types and use them to fully characterize the routes to resonance across all values of the relevant timescales. We find that resonance arises primarily due to slow adaptation with an intrinsic frequency acting to sharpen and adjust the location of the resonant peak. We determine the parameter regions for the existence of an intrinsic frequency and for subthreshold and spiking resonance, finding all possible intersections of the three. The expressions and analysis presented here provide an account of how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape dynamic population response properties and can facilitate the construction of an exact theory of correlations and stability of population activity in networks containing populations of resonator neurons.\n\nAuthor SummaryDynamic gain, the amount by which features at specific frequencies in the input to a neuron are amplified or attenuated in its output spiking, is fundamental for the encoding of information by neural populations. Most studies of dynamic gain have focused on neurons without intrinsic degrees of freedom exhibiting integrator-type subthreshold dynamics. Many neuron types in the brain, however, exhibit complex subthreshold dynamics such as resonance, found for instance in cortical interneurons, stellate cells, and mitral cells. A resonator neuron has at least two degrees of freedom for which the classical Fokker-Planck approach to calculating the dynamic gain is largely intractable. Here, we lift the voltage-reset rule after a spike, allowing us to derive for the first time a complete expression of the dynamic gain of a resonator neuron model. We find the gain can exhibit only six shapes. The resonant ones have peaks that become large due to intrinsic adaptation and become sharp due to an intrinsic frequency. A resonance can nevertheless result from either property. The analysis presented here helps explain how intrinsic neuron dynamics shape population-level response properties and provides a powerful tool for developing theories of inter-neuron correlations and dynamic responses of neural populations."
10.1101/027912,"Genetic switches based on the NF{kappa}B/I{kappa}B/DNA system are master regulators of an array of cellular responses. Recent kinetic experiments have shown that I{kappa}B can actively remove NF{kappa}B bound to its genetic sites via a process called \""molecular stripping\"". This allows the NF{kappa}B/I{kappa}B/DNA switch to function under kinetic control rather than the thermodynamic control contemplated in the traditional models of gene switches. Using molecular dynamics simulations of coarse grained predictive energy landscape models for the constituent proteins by themselves and interacting with the DNA we explore the functional motions of the transcription factor NF{kappa}B and its various binary and ternary complexes with DNA and the inhibitor I{kappa}B. These studies show that the function of the NF{kappa}B/I{kappa}B/DNA genetic switch is realized via an allosteric mechanism. Molecular stripping occurs through the activation of a domain twist mode by the binding of I{kappa}B which occurs through conformational selection. Free energy calculations for DNA binding show that the binding of I{kappa}B not only results in a significant decrease of the affinity of the transcription factor for the DNA but also kinetically speeds DNA release. Projections of the free energy onto various reaction coordinates reveal the structural details of the stripping pathways."
10.1101/028159,"Cancer cell lines are often used in laboratory experiments as models of tumors, although they can have substantially different genetic and epigenetic profiles compared to tumors. We have developed a general computational method - TumorComparer - to systematically quantify similarities and differences between tumor material when detailed genetic and molecular profiles are available. The comparisons can be flexibly tailored to a particular biological question by placing a higher weight on functional alterations of interest ( weighted similarity). In a first pan-cancer application, we have compared 260 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) and 1914 tumors of six different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), using weights to emphasize genomic alterations that frequently recur in tumors. We report the potential suitability of particular cell lines as tumor models and identify apparently unsuitable outlier cell lines, some of which are in wide use, for each of the six cancer types. In future, this weighted similarity method may be generalized for use in a clinical setting to compare patient profiles consisting of genomic patterns combined with clinical attributes, such as diagnosis, treatment and response to therapy."
10.1101/028092,"Maternal effects are widely documented in animals and plants, but not in fungi or other eukaryotes. A principal cause of maternal effects is asymmetrical parental investment in a zygote, creating greater maternal versus paternal influence on offspring phenotypes. Asymmetrical investments are not limited to animals and plants, but are also prevalent in fungi and groups including apicocomplexans, dinoflagellates, and red algae. Evidence suggesting maternal effects among fungi is sparse and anecdotal. In an experiment designed to test for maternal effects across sexual reproduction in the model fungus Neurospora crassa, we measured offspring phenotypes from crosses of all possible pairs of 22 individuals. Crosses encompassed reciprocals of 11 mating-type \""A\"" and 11 mating-type \""a\"" wild strains. After controlling for the genetic and geographic distances between strains in any individual cross, we found strong evidence for maternal control of sporocarp production, as well as maternal effects on spore numbers and spore germination. However, both parents exert equal influence on the percentage of spores that are pigmented, and size of pigmented spores. We propose a model linking the stage-specific presence or absence of maternal effects to cellular developmental processes: effects appear to be mediated primarily through the maternal cytoplasm, and, after spore cell walls form, maternal influence on spore development is limited. Maternal effects in fungi, thus far largely ignored, are likely to shape species evolution and ecology. The association of anisogamy and maternal effects in a fungus suggests maternal effects may also influence the biology of other anisogamous eukaryotes."

10.1101/028142,"The relationship between enzyme-catalysed reactions and the Enzyme Commission (EC) number, the widely accepted classification scheme used to characterise enzyme activity, is complex and with the rapid increase in our knowledge of the reactions catalysed by enzymes needs revisiting. We present a manual and computational analysis to investigate this complexity and found that almost one-third of all known EC numbers are linked to more than one reaction in the secondary reaction databases (e.g. KEGG). Although this complexity is often resolved by defining generic, alternative and partial reactions, we have also found individual EC numbers with more than one reaction catalysing different types of bond changes. This analysis adds a new dimension to our understanding of enzyme function and might be useful for the accurate annotation of the function of enzymes and to study the changes in enzyme function during evolution."
10.1101/028191,"Recent developments in data driven science, in particular computational biology, have led scientists to integrate data from several sources, over diverse experimental procedures, or databases. This alone poses a major challenge in truthfully visualising data, especially when the amount of data points varies between classes.\n\nTo aid the presentation of datasets with differing sample size we have developed a new type of plot overcoming limitations of current standard visualization charts. Plots like bar charts, violin plots, strip charts or box-and-whiskers plots may provide visual information about mean/median, variance of the data, number of data points or density distribution of data; still, only a combination of these plots may provide all relevant information.\n\nWe have designed a new and simple plot inspired by the strip chart and the violin plot that operates by letting the normalized density of points restrict the jitter along the x-axis. The plot displays the same contour as a violin plot, but resembles a simple strip chart for small number of data points. In this way the plot conveys information of both the number of data points, the density distribution, outliers and data spread in a very simple, comprehensible and condensed format. The package for producing the plots is available for R through the CRAN network (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sinaplot/index.html). In order to aid users without experience in R we also provide access to a web-server accepting excel sheets to produce the plots (http://servers.binf.ku.dk:8890/sinaplot/)."

10.1101/028274,"BackgroundSpatial scale is important when studying ecological processes. The Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a large sexually dimorphic tetraonid that is endemic to the sagebrush biome of western North America. The impacts of oil and gas development at individual leks has been well-documented. However, no previous studies have quantified the population-level response.\n\nMethodsHierarchical models were used to estimate the effects of the areal disturbance due to well pads as well as climatic variation on individual lek counts and Greater sage-grouse populations (management units) over 32 years. The lek counts were analyzed using General Linear Mixed Models while the management units were analyzed using Gompertz Population Dynamic Models. The models were fitted using frequentist and Bayesian methods. An information-theoretic approach was used to identify the most important spatial scale and time lags. The relative importance of oil and gas and climate at the local and population-level scales was assessed using information-theoretic (Akaikes weights) and estimation (effect size) statistics.\n\nResultsAt the local scale, oil and gas was an important negative predictor of the lek count. At the population scale, there was only weak support for oil and gas as a predictor of density changes but the estimated impacts on the long-term carrying capacity were consistent with summation of the local impacts. Regional climatic variation, as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, was an important positive predictor of density changes at both the local and population-level (particularly in the most recent part of the time series).\n\nConclusionsAdditional studies to reduce the uncertainty in the range of possible effects of oil and gas at the population scale are required. Wildlife agencies need to account for the effects of regional climatic variation when managing sage-grouse populations."
10.1101/028324,"1.Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in eukaryotic plastids and mitochondrial genomes is common, and plays an important role in organism evolution. In yeasts, recent mitochondrial HGT has been suggested between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. However, few strains have been explored due to the lack of accurate mitochondrial genome annotations. Mitochondrial genome sequences are important to understand how frequent these introgressions occur and their role in cytonuclear incompatibilities and fitness. In fact, most of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller genetic incompatibilities described in yeasts are driven by cytonuclear incompatibilities. In this study, we have explored the mitochondrial inheritance of several worldwide distributed Saccharomyces species isolated from different sources and geographic origins. We demonstrated the existence of several recombination points in the mitochondrial region COX2-ORF1, likely mediated by the transfer of two different types of ORF1 (F-SceIII), encoding a freestanding homing endonuclease, or mostly facilitated by A+T tandem repeats and regions of integration of GC clusters. These introgressions were shown to occur at intra- as well as at interspecific levels. This suggest a complex model of Saccharomyces evolution which involve several ancestral hybridization events in wild environments."
10.1101/028340,"Capra hircus, an economically important livestock, plays an indispensable role in the world animal fiber industry. To identify additional genes that may play important roles in coat color regulation, Illumina/Solexa high throughput sequencing technology was used to catalog the global gene expression profiles in the skin of three different coat colors goat (Lubei white goat (white), Jining gray goat (gray) and Jianyang big ear goat (brown)). The RNA-Seq analysis generated 83174342, 70222592 and 52091212 clean reads in white skin, gray skin and brown skin, respectively, which provided abundant data for further analysis. A total of 91 genes were differentially expressed between the gray skin and white skin libraries, with 74 upregulated and 17 genes downregulated. Between the brown skin and white skin libraries, there were 23 upregulated genes and 44 downregulated genes, while there were 33 upregulated genes and 121 downregulated genes between the brown skin and gray skin libraries. To our surprise, MC1R, MITF, TYR, KIT and KITLG showed no significant difference in the skin of three different coat colors and the expression of ASIP was only detected in white skin and not in gray and brown skins. The expression of PMEL, TRPM1, DCT, TYRP1 and ELOVL3 was validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the results of the qPCR were consistent with the RNA-seq except the expression of TYRP1 between the gray skin and white skin libraries. This study provides several candidate genes that may be associated with the development of diferent coat colors goat skin. More importantly, the fact that the ASIP gene was only detected in the white skin and not in the other dark skins and the MC1R gene showed no significant difference in expression between the three different coat colors goat is of particular interest for future studies that aim to elucidate theirs functional role in the regulation of skin color. These results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms of skin physiology and melanogenesis in goat and provide a foundation for future studies."
10.1101/028282,"Recent work has leveraged the extensive genotyping of the Icelandic population to perform long-range phasing (LRP), enabling accurate imputation and association analysis of rare variants in target samples typed on genotyping arrays. Here, we develop a fast and accurate LRP method, Eagle, that extends this paradigm to populations with much smaller proportions of genotyped samples by harnessing long (>4cM) identical-by-descent (IBD) tracts shared among distantly related individuals. We applied Eagle to N=150K samples (0.2% of the British population) from the UK Biobank, and we determined that it is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing methods while achieving similar or better phasing accuracy (switch error rate {approx}0.3%, corresponding to perfect phase in most 10Mb segments). We also observed that when used within an imputation pipeline, Eagle pre-phasing improved downstream imputation accuracy compared to pre-phasing in batches using existing methods (as necessary to achieve comparable computational cost)."
10.1101/028241,"Purpose:The pace of Mendelian gene discovery is slowed by the \""n-of-1 problem\"" - the difficulty of establishing causality of a putatively pathogenic variant in a single person or family. Identification of an unrelated person with an overlapping phenotype and suspected pathogenic variant in the same gene can overcome this barrier but is often impeded by lack of a convenient or widely-available way to share data on candidate variants / genes among families, clinicians and researchers.\n\nMethods:Social networking among families, clinicians and researchers was used to identify three children with variants of unknown significance in KDM1A and similar phenotypes.\n\nResults:De novo variants in KDM1A underlie a new syndrome characterized by developmental delay and distinctive facial features.\n\nConclusion:Social networking is a potentially powerful strategy to discover genes for rare Mendelian conditions, particularly those with non-specific phenotypic features.

10.1101/028308,"The Drosophila genome contains >13,000 protein coding genes, the majority of which remain poorly investigated. Important reasons include the lack of antibodies or reporter constructs to visualise these proteins. Here we present a genome-wide fosmid library of {approx}10,000 GFP-tagged clones, comprising tagged genes and most of their regulatory information. For 880 tagged proteins we have created transgenic lines and for a total of 207 lines we have assessed protein expression and localisation in ovaries, embryos, pupae or adults by stainings and live imaging approaches. Importantly, we can visualise many proteins at endogenous expression levels and find a large fraction of them localising to subcellular compartments. Using complementation tests we demonstrate that two-thirds of the tagged proteins are fully functional. Moreover, our clones also enable interaction proteomics from developing pupae and adult flies. Taken together, this resource will enable systematic analysis of protein expression and localisation in various cellular and developmental contexts."
10.1101/028290,"Despite advances in sequencing, structural variants (SVs) remain difficult to reliably detect due to the short read length (<300bp) of 2nd generation sequencing. Not only do the reads (or paired-end reads) need to straddle a breakpoint, but repetitive elements often lead to ambiguities in the alignment of short reads. We propose to use the long-reads (up to 20kb) possible with 3rd generation sequencing, specifically nanopore sequencing on the MinION. Nanopore sequencing relies on a similar concept to a Coulter counter, reading the DNA sequence from the change in electrical current resulting from a DNA strand being forced through a nanometer-sized pore embedded in a membrane. Though nanopore sequencing currently has a relatively high mismatch rate that precludes base substitution and small frameshift mutation detection, its accuracy is sufficient for SV detection because of its long reads. In fact, long reads in some cases may improve SV detection efficiency.\n\nWe have tested nanopore sequencing to detect a series of well-characterized SVs, including large deletions, inversions, and translocations that inactivate the CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic cancer. Using PCR amplicon mixes, we have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing can detect large deletions, translocations and inversions at dilutions as low as 1:100, with as few as 500 reads per sample. Given the speed, small footprint, and low capital cost, nanopore sequencing could become the ideal tool for the low-level detection of cancer-associated SVs needed for molecular relapse, early detection, or therapeutic monitoring."
10.1101/028332,"RNA surveillance by the Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway eliminates potentially deleterious transcripts containing Premature Termination Codons (PTCs). The transition from a pioneering round of translation to steady state translation is hypothesized to be a major checkpoint in this process. One hallmark of mRNAs licensed for translation is the exchange of 7-methylguanosine cap binding proteins. However, mRNAs undergoing steady state translation are also NMD substrates, raising mechanistic questions about the NMD checkpoint. To test the role of cap binding proteins in NMD, we modulated the protein composition of cytoplasmic messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) with the naturally occurring macrolide rapamycin. We demonstrate that despite well-documented attenuation of cap-dependent mRNA translation, rapamycin can augment NMD. Rapamycin-treatment significantly reduces the levels of endogenous and exogenous PTC-containing mRNA isoforms in a dose- and UPF1- dependent manner. PTC-containing transcripts exhibit a shorter half-life upon rapamacyin-treatment as compared to non-PTC isoforms. Rapamycin also causes depletion of PTC-containing mRNA isoforms from polyribosomes, suggesting that actively translating ribosomes can transition between low and high NMD states. Importantly, mRNPs show depletion of eIF4E and retention of the nuclear Cap Binding Complex (CBC) in rapamycin-treated cells. Our data demonstrate that rapamycin potentiates pioneer-like mRNP context thereby decreasing NMD evasion."
10.1101/028316,"Cell assemblies are thought to be the units of information representation in the brain, yet their detection from experimental data is arduous. Here, we propose to infer effective coupling networks and model distributions for the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in prefrontal cortex, during the performance of a decision-making task, and during preceding and following sleep epochs. Our approach, inspired from statistical physics, allows us to define putative cell assemblies as the groups of co-activated neurons in the models of the three recorded epochs. It reveals the existence of task-related changes of the effective couplings between the sleep epochs. The assemblies which strongly coactivate during the task epoch are found to replay during subsequent sleep, in correspondence to the changes of the inferred network. Across sessions, a variety of different network scenarios is observed, providing insight in cell assembly formation and replay.\n\nAuthor SummaryMemories are thought to be represented in the brain through groups of coactivating neurons, the so-called cell assemblies. We propose an approach to identify cell assemblies from multi-electrode recordings of neural activity in vivo, and apply it to the prefrontal cortex activity of a behaving rat. Our statistical physics inspired approach consists in inferring effective interactions between the recorded cells, which reproduce the correlations in their spiking activities. The analysis of the effective interaction networks and of the model distributions allows us to identify cell assemblies, which strongly co-activate when the rat is learning, and also during subsequent sleep. Our approach is thus capable of providing detailed insights in cell-assembly formation and replay, crucial for memory consolidation."
10.1101/028183,"Agings most obvious characteristic is the time dependent increase of an individuals probability to die. This lifelong process is accompanied by a large number of molecular and physiological changes. Although numerous genes involved in aging have been identified in the past decades its leading factors have yet to be determined. To identify the very processes driving aging we have developed in the past years an assay to identify physiologically old individuals in a synchronized population of Drosophila melanogaster. Those individuals show an age-dependent increase of intestinal permeability followed by a high risk of death. Here we show that this physiological marker of aging is conserved in 3 invertebrate species Drosophila mojavensis, Drosophila virilis, Caenorhabditis elegans and 1 vertebrate specie Danio rerio. Our findings suggest that intestinal barrier dysfunction may be an important event in the aging process conserved across a broad range of species, thus raising the possibility that it may also be the case in Homo sapiens."
10.1101/028266,"In the past decade, researchers have been able to obtain pluripotent stem cells directly from an organisms differentiated cells through a process called cell reprogramming. This opens the way to potentially groundbreaking applications in regenerative and personalized medicine, in which ill patients could use self-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells where needed. While the process of reprogramming has been shown to be possible, its efficiency remains so low after almost ten years since its conception as to render its applicability limited to laboratory research. In this paper, we study a mathematical model of the core transcriptional circuitry among a set of key transcription factors, which is thought to determine the switch among pluripotent and differentiated cell types. By employing standard tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the effects on the systems dynamics of overexpressing the core factors, which is what is performed during the reprogramming process. We demonstrate that the structure of the system is such that it can render the switch from an initial stable steady state (differentiated cell type) to the desired stable steady state (pluripotent cell type) highly unlikely. This finding provides insights into a possible reason for the low efficiency of current reprogramming approaches."
10.1101/028167,"How a potentially diverse population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiates and proliferates to supply more than 1011 mature blood cells every day in humans remains a key biological question. We investigated this process by quantitatively analyzing the clonal structure of peripheral blood that is generated by a population of transplanted lentivirus-marked HSCs in myeloablated rhesus macaques. Each transplanted HSC generates a clonal lineage of cells in the peripheral blood that is then detected and quantified through deep sequencing of the viral vector integration sites (VIS) common within each lineage. This approach allowed us to observe, over a period of 4-12 years, hundreds of distinct clonal lineages. Surprisingly, while the distinct clone sizes varied by three orders of magnitude, we found that collectively, they form a steady-state clone size-distribution with a distinctive shape. Our concise model shows that slow HSC differentiation followed by fast progenitor growth is responsible for the observed broad clone size-distribution. Although all cells are assumed to be statistically identical, analogous to a neutral theory for the different clone lineages, our mathematical approach captures the intrinsic variability in the times to HSC differentiation after transplantation. Steady-state solutions of our model show that the predicted clone size-distribution is sensitive to only two combinations of parameters. By fitting the measured clone size-distributions to our mechanistic model, we estimate both the effective HSC differentiation rate and the number of active HSCs."
10.1101/028357,"The outcome of a major evolutionary transition is the aggregation of independent entities into a new synergetic level of organisation. Classical models involve either pairwise interactions between individuals or a linear superposition of these interactions. However, major evolutionary transitions display synergetic effects: their outcome is not just the sum of its parts. Multiplayer games can display such synergies, as their payoff can be different from the sum of any collection of two-player interactions. Assuming that all interactions start from pairs, how can synergetic multiplayer games emerge from simpler pairwise interaction? Here, we present a mathematical model that captures the transition from pairwise interactions to synergetic multiplayer ones. We assume that different social groups have different breaking rates. We show that non-uniform breaking rates do foster the emergence of synergy, even though individuals always interact in pairs. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying a major evolutionary transition."
10.1101/028027,"We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in the primary motor cortex and sensorimotor striatum in awake, freely behaving, 6-OHDA lesioned hemi-parkinsonian rats in order to study the features directly related to pathological states such as parkinsonian state and levodopa-induced dyskinesia. We analysed the spectral characteristics of the obtained signals and observed that during dyskinesia the most prominent feature was a relative power increase in the high gamma frequency range at around 80 Hz, while for the parkinsonian state it was in the beta frequency range. Here we show that during both pathological states effective connectivity in terms of Granger causality is bidirectional with an accent on the striatal influence on the cortex. In the case of dyskinesia, we also found a high increase in effective connectivity at 80 Hz. In order to further understand the 80- Hz phenomenon, we performed cross-frequency analysis and observed characteristic patterns in the case of dyskinesia but not in the case of the parkinsonian state or the control state. We noted a large decrease in the modulation of the amplitude at 80 Hz by the phase of low frequency oscillations (up to ~10 Hz) across both structures in the case of dyskinesia. This may suggest a lack of coupling between the low frequency activity of the recorded network and the group of neurons active at ~80 Hz."

Such similarity measurements contribute to diverse applications, such as identifying genetic models for human diseases, transferring knowledge among model organisms, and studying the genetic basis of evolutionary innovations. Two organismal features, whether genes, anatomical parts, or any other inherited feature, are considered to be homologous when they are evolutionarily derived from a single feature in a common ancestor. A classic example is the homology between the paired fins of fishes and vertebrate limbs. Anatomical ontologies that model the structural relations among parts may fail to include some known anatomical homologies unless they are deliberately added as separate axioms. The consequences of neglecting known homologies for applications that rely on such ontologies has not been well studied. Here, we examine how semantic similarity is affected when external homology knowledge is included. We measure phenotypic similarity between orthologous and non-orthologous gene pairs between humans and either mouse or zebrafish, and compare the inclusion of real with faux homology axioms. Semantic similarity was preferentially increased for orthologs when using real homology axioms, but only in the more divergent of the two species comparisons (human to zebrafish, not human to mouse), and the relative increase was less than 1% to non-orthologs. By contrast, inclusion of both real and faux random homology axioms preferentially increased similarities between genes that were initially more dissimilar in the other comparisons. Biologically meaningful increases in semantic similarity were seen for a select subset of gene pairs. Overall, the effect of including homology axioms on cross-species semantic similarity was modest at the levels of divergence examined here, but our results hint that it may be greater for more distant species comparisons."
10.1101/028415,"ABSTRACTSDespite large-scale efforts to systematically map the cancer genome, little is known about how the interplay of genetic and epigenetic alternations shapes the architecture of the tumors transcriptome. With the goal of constructing a system-level view of the deregulated pathways in cancer cells, we systematically investigated the functional organization of the transcriptomes of 10 tumor types using data sets generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA). Our analysis indicates that the human cancer transcriptome is organized into well-conserved modules of co-expressed genes. In particular, our analysis identified a set of conserved gene modules with distinct cancer hallmark themes involving cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, innate and adaptive immune response, differentiation, metabolism and regulation of protein phosphorylation. We applied a network inference approach to nominate candidate drivers of these conserved gene modules. The predicted drivers have consistent cancer-relevant functions related to the specific hallmarks and are enriched with cancer consensus genes and significantly mutated genes. We showed genetic alternations of TP53 and other cell cycle drivers have major downstream transcriptional impact on cell cycle regulation. Collectively, our analysis provided global views of convergent transcriptome architecture of human cancer. The result of our analysis can serve as a foundation to link diverse genomic alternations to common transcriptomic features in human cancer."
10.1101/028423,"Papua New Guinea is one of the most valuable tropical regions but ecological research of its freshwater invertebrates has been lacking. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the species richness, diversity and structure of aquatic insect assemblages in different habitats in the Wanang River catchment in a well-preserved lowland rainforest. Assemblage structure was studied on two spatial scales - in different habitats (river, streams and stagnant pools) and in three mesohabitats in the river (slow and fast sections and submerged wood). The results show that headwater streams had the highest morphospecies diversity, while the river had the highest insect abundance. Slow and fast sections of the river differed both in terms of insect abundance and diversity. Furthermore, a number of unique wood-associated species was found on submerged wood. The most notable feature of the assemblage structure was scarcity of shredders and dominance of predators. However, predatory beetles, bugs and dragonfly larvae exhibited contrasting habitat preferences. This study shows that Papua New Guinean lowland rainforests host diverse and distinctly structured freshwater insect assemblages."
10.1101/028399,"The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanism. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance--deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce an open source package Basset (https://github.com/davek44/Basset) to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq and demonstrate far greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cells chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome."
10.1101/028464,"Extensive efforts have been made to understand genomic function through both experimental and computational approaches, yet proper annotation still remains challenging, especially in non-coding regions. In this manuscript, we introduce GenoSkyline, an unsupervised learning framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions through integrating high-throughput epigenetic annotations. GenoSkyline successfully identified a variety of non-coding regulatory machinery including enhancers, regulatory miRNA, and hypomethylated transposable elements in extensive case studies. Integrative analysis of GenoSkyline annotations and results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to novel biological insights on the etiologies of a number of human complex traits. We also explored using tissue-specific functional annotations to prioritize GWAS signals and predict relevant tissue types for each risk locus. Brain and blood-specific annotations led to better prioritization performance for schizophrenia than standard GWAS p-values and non-tissue-specific annotations. As for coronary artery disease, heart-specific functional regions was highly enriched of GWAS signals, but previously identified risk loci were found to be most functional in other tissues, suggesting a substantial proportion of still undetected heart-related loci. In summary, GenoSkyline annotations can guide genetic studies at multiple resolutions and provide valuable insights in understanding complex diseases.

10.1101/028456,"Non-protein-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in cell physiology, with a diverse repertoire of known functions. In fact, the majority of the eukaryotic genome does not code for proteins, and thousands of conserved long non-protein-coding RNAs of currently unkown function have been identified. When available, knowledge of their 3D structure is very helpful in elucidating the function of these RNAs. However, despite some outstanding structure elucidation of RNAs using X-ray crystallography, NMR and cryoEM, learning RNA 3D structures remains low-throughput. RNA structure prediction in silico is a promising alternative approach and works well for double-helical stems, but full 3D structure determination requires tertiary contacts outside of secondary structures that are difficult to infer from sequence information. Here, based only on information from RNA multiple sequence alignments, we use a global statistical sequence probability model of co-variation in a pairs of nucleotide positions to detect 3D contacts, in analogy to recently developed breakthrough methods for computational protein folding. In blinded tests on 22 known RNA structures ranging in size from 65 to 1800 nucleotides, the predicted contacts matched physical nucleotide interactions with 65-95% true positive prediction accuracy. Importantly, we infer many long-range tertiary contacts, including non-Watson-Crick interactions, where secondary structure elements assemble in 3D. When used as restraints in molecular dynamics simulations, the inferred contacts improve RNA 3D structure prediction to a coordinate error as low as 6 - 10 [A] rmsd deviation in atom positions, with potential for further refinement by molecular dynamics. These contacts include functionally important interactions, such as those that distinguish the active and inactive conformations of four riboswitches. In blind prediction mode, we present evolutionary couplings suitable for folding simulations for 180 RNAs of unknown structure, available at https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/ev_rna/. We anticipate that this approach can help shed light on the structure and function of non-protein-coding RNAs as well as 3D-structured mRNAs."
10.1101/028522,"A major constraint on the evolution of large body sizes in animals is an increased risk of developing cancer. There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as  Petos Paradox. Here we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Petos paradox in Proboscideans."
10.1101/028555,"Use of low resolution single cell DNA FISH and population based high resolution chromosome conformation capture techniques have highlighted the importance of pairwise chromatin interactions in gene regulation. However, it is unlikely that these associations act in isolation of other interacting partners within the genome. Indeed, the influence of multi-loci interactions in gene control remains something of an enigma as beyond low-resolution DNA FISH we do not have the appropriate tools to analyze these. Here we present a method that uses standard 4C-seq data to identify multi-loci interactions from the same cell. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method using 4C-seq data sets that identify known pairwise interactions involving the Tcrb and Igk antigen receptor enhancers, in addition to novel tri-loci associations. We further show that enhancer deletions not only interfere with tri-loci interactions in which they participate, but they also disrupt pairwise interactions between other partner enhancers and this disruption is linked to a reduction in their transcriptional output. These findings underscore the functional importance of hubs and provide new insight into chromatin organization as a whole. Our method opens the door for studying multi-loci interactions and their impact on gene regulation in other biological settings."
10.1101/028100,"The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains."
10.1101/028506,"Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Resistance to first-line empirical monotherapy has emerged, so robust methods are needed to appropriately evaluate the activity of existing and novel antimicrobials against the bacterium. Pharmacodynamic functions, which describe the relationship between the concentration of antimicrobials and the bacterial net growth rate, provide more detailed information than the MIC only. In this study, a novel standardized in vitro time-kill curve assay was developed. The assay was validated using five World Health Organization N. gonorrhoeae reference strains and various concentrations of ciprofloxacin, and then the activity of nine antimicrobials with different target mechanisms were examined against a highly susceptible clinical wild type isolate (cultured in 1964). From the time-kill curves, the bacterial net growth rates at each antimicrobial concentration were estimated. Finally, a pharmacodynamic function was fitted to the data, resulting in four parameters that describe the pharmacodynamic properties of each antimicrobial. Ciprofloxacin resistance determinants shifted the pharmacodynamic MIC (zMIC) and attenuated the bactericidal effect at antimicrobial concentrations above the zMIC. Ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and gentamicin had the strongest bactericidal effect during the first six hours of the assay. Only tetracycline and chloramphenicol showed a purely bacteriostatic effect. The pharmacodynamic functions differed between antimicrobials, showing that the effect of the drugs at concentrations below and above the MIC vary widely. In conclusion, N. gonorrhoeae time-kill curve experiments analyzed with pharmacodynamic functions have potential for in vitro evaluation of new and existing antimicrobials and dosing strategies to treat gonorrhea."
10.1101/028514,"It has been shown that resting state brain dynamics can be characterized by looking at sparse blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) events, which can be retrieved by point process analysis. Cardiac activity can also induce changes in the BOLD signal, thus affect both the number of these events and the mapping between neural events and BOLD signal, namely the hemodynamic response. To isolate neural activity and autonomic effects, we compare the resting state hemodynamic response retrieved by means of a point process analysis with and without deconvolving the cardiac fluctuations. Brainstem and the surrounding cortical area (such as precuneus, insula etc.) are found to be significantly affected by cardiac pulses. Methodological and physiological implications are then discussed."

This approach improves confidence in model predictions by mitigating the risk that spurious Virtual Patients become over-represented in Virtual Populations."

10.1101/028662,"Understanding the causes of within-and among-population differences in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics is a central topic in ecology. To understand how within-and among-population variation emerges, we need long-term studies that include episodic events and contrasting environmental conditions, data to characterize individual and shared variation, and statistical models that can tease apart population-, shared-, and individual contribution to the observed variation.\n\nWe used long-term tag-recapture data and novel statistical and modeling techniques to investigate and estimate within-and among-population differences in vital rates, life histories and population dynamics of marble trout Salmo marmoratus, a endemic freshwater salmonid with a narrow range. Only ten populations of pure marble trout persist in headwaters of Alpine rivers in western Slovenia. Marble trout populations are also threatened by floods and landslides, which have caused the extinction of two populations in recent years. We estimated and determined causes of variation in growth, survival, and recruitment both within and among populations, and evaluated trade-offs between them. Specifically, we estimated the responses of these traits to variation in water temperature, density, sex, early life conditions, and the occurrence of extreme climatic events (e.g., flash floods and debris flows).\n\nWe found that the effects of population density on traits were mostly limited to the early stages of life and that individual growth trajectories were established early in life. We found no clear effects of water temperature on survival and recruitment. Population density varied over time, with flash floods and debris flows causing massive mortalities and threatening population persistence. Apart from flood events, variation in population density within streams was largely determined by variation in recruitment, with survival of older fish being relatively constant over time within populations, but substantially different among populations. Marble trout show a fast-to-slow continuum of life histories, with slow growth associated with higher survival at the population level, possibly determined by food conditions and age at maturity.\n\nOur work provides unprecedented insight into the causes of variation in vital rates, life histories, and population dynamics in an endemic species that is teetering on the edge of extinction."
10.1101/028647,"Selective breeding of dogs has resulted in repeated artificial selection on breed-specific morphological phenotypes. A number of quantitative trait loci associated with these phenotypes have been identified in genetic mapping studies. We analyzed the population genomic signatures observed around the causal mutations for 12 of these loci in 25 dog breeds, for which we genotyped 25 individuals in each breed. By measuring the population frequencies of the causal mutations in each breed, we identified those breeds in which specific mutations most likely experienced positive selection. These instances were then used as positive controls for assessing the performance of popular statistics to detect selection from population genomic data. We found that artificial selection during dog domestication has left characteristic signatures in the haplotype and nucleotide polymorphism patterns around selected loci that can be detected in the genotype data from a single population sample. However, the sensitivity and accuracy at which such signatures were detected varied widely between loci, the particular statistic used, and the choice of analysis parameters. We observed examples of both hard and soft selective sweeps and detected strong selective events that removed genetic diversity almost entirely over regions >10 Mbp. Our study demonstrates the power and limitations of selection scans in populations with high levels of linkage disequilibrium due to severe founder effects and recent population bottlenecks."

Of the 139 independent associations identified in these regions, 18 were pinpointed to a single causal variant with >95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with >50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n=13), direct disruption of transcription factor binding sites (n=3) and tissue specific epigenetic marks (n=10), with the latter category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in CD and gut mucosa among associations stronger in UC.

10.1101/028670,"Polymorphic chromosomal rearrangements, which can bind together hundreds of genes into single genetic loci with diverse effects, are increasingly associated with local adaptation and speciation. They may also be an important component of genetic variation within populations. We genetically and phenotypically characterized a novel segregating inversion (inv6) in the Iron Mountain (IM) population of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). We first identified a region of recombination suppression in three F2 mapping populations resulting from crosses among IM plants; in each case, the F1 hybrid parent was heterozygous for a homogenous derived haplotype (inv6) across markers spanning over 4.2 Mb of Linkage Group 6. Genotype-phenotype associations in the three F2 populations demonstrated negative inv6 effects on male and female fitness components. In addition, inv6 carriers suffered a ~30% loss of pollen viability in the field. Despite these costs, inv6 exists at moderate and apparently stable frequency (~7%) in the natural population, suggesting counter-balancing fitness benefits that maintain the polymorphism. Across four years of monitoring in the field, inv6 had an overall significant positive effect on the seed production (lifetime female fitness) of carriers. This benefit was particularly strong in harsh years and may be mediated (in part) by strong positive inv6 effects on flower production. These data suggest that opposing fitness effects maintain an intermediate frequency, and as a consequence, inv6 generates inbreeding depression and high genetic variance. We discuss these findings in the context of theory about the genetic basis of inbreeding depression and the role for chromosomal rearrangements in population divergence with gene flow."

10.1101/028597,"Lay summaryFor polygamous long-migrant birds, the choice of migration strategy depends on social pressure and experience and influences the chance of survival. If you are a male, youd better leave early in the spring to secure the best site to show off. In fall, juveniles have a hard time surviving to migration as they leave before the adults and lack experience on where to go and where to stop to rest.\n\nAbstractThe process of migration stems from an adaptation of climatic seasonality and animals have developed various strategies to complete the journey between a wintering and breeding ground. Understanding the migratory behavior and determining when and where mortality occurs during the annual cycle is fundamental to understand population dynamics and implement appropriate conservation measures. Based on a big data set and advanced statistical methods, we inspected the phenology of migration of a polygynous land bird, the Macqueens bustard, Chlamydotis macqueenii. We explored its migration strategies between sex, age, season and geographical origin. We show that departure for migration depended on age in the fall with juveniles being the first to leave and on age and sex in the spring with juveniles departing later and males induced to arrive early in spring to secure high-quality territories. Birds breeding at higher latitudes were the first to leave in the fall and more likely to perform longer stopovers. Bustards exhibited different strategies for spring and fall migrations: spring migration was significantly longer than fall migration with more but shorter stopovers. Survival was lower for juveniles experiencing their first migration and for all birds during fall migration and on their wintering ground. Experience linked to social hierarchical pressures and environmental conditions might be the key drivers of migration strategies and survival in long-distance polygynous migrants."
10.1101/028571,"Individuals are different, but they can work together to perform adaptive collective behaviours. Despite emerging evidence that individual variation strongly affects group performance, it is less clear to what extent individual variation is modulated by participation in collective behaviour. We examined light avoidance (negative phototaxis) in the gregarious cockroach Blaberus discoidalis, in both solitary and group contexts. Cockroaches in groups exhibit idiosyncratic light-avoidance performance that persists across days, with some individual cockroaches avoiding a light stimulus 75% of the time, and others avoiding the light just above chance (i.e. ~50% of the time). These individual differences are robust to group composition. Surprisingly, these differences do not persist when individuals are tested in isolation, but return when testing is once again done with groups. During the solo testing phase cockroaches exhibited individually consistent light-avoidance tendencies, but these differences were uncorrelated with performance in any group context. Therefore, we have observed not only that individual variation affects group-level performance, but also that whether or not a task is performed collectively can have a significant, predictable effect on how an individual behaves. That individual behavioural variation is modulated by whether a task is performed collectively has major implications for understanding variation in behaviours that are facultatively social, and it is essential that ethologists consider social context when evaluating individual behavioural differences.\n\nAbbreviations: DLP: digital light processing; MP: megapixels; ANOVA: analysis of variance, ICC: intraclass correlation coefficient, CI: confidence interval."
10.1101/028720,"Cancer prediction is of great importance and significance and it is crucial to provide researchers and scientists with novel, accurate and robust computational tools for this issue. Recent technologies such as Microarray and Next Generation Sequencing have paved the way for computational methods and techniques to play critical roles in this regard. Many important problems in cell biology require the dense nonlinear interactions between functional modules to be considered. The importance of computer simulation in understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of simulation algorithms useful for studying certain subsystems have been designed. In this article, a Sparse Compact Incremental Learning Machine (SCILM) is proposed for cancer classification problem on microarray gene expression data which take advantage of Correntropy cost that makes it robust against diverse noises and outliers. Moreover, since SCILM uses l1-norm of the weights, it has sparseness which can be applied for gene selection purposes as well. Finally, due to compact structure, the proposed method is capable of performing classification tasks in all of the cases with only one neuron in its hidden layer. The experimental analysis is performed on 26 well known microarray datasets regarding diverse kinds of cancers and the results show that the proposed method not only achieved significantly high accuracy but also because of its sparseness, final connectivity weights determined the value and effectivity of each gene regarding the corresponding cancer."
10.1101/028738,"Standard models of molecular evolution cannot estimate absolute speciation times alone, and require external calibrations to do so. Because fossil calibration methods rely on the unreliable fossil record, most nodes in the tree of life are dated with poor accuracy. However, many major paleogeographical events are dated, and since biogeographic processes depend on paleogeographical conditions, biogeographic dating may be used as an alternative or complementary method to fossil dating. I demonstrate how a time-stratified biogeographic stochastic process may be used to estimate absolute divergence times by conditioning on dated paleogeographical events. Informed by the current paleogeographical literature, I construct an empirical dispersal graph using 25 areas and 26 epochs for the past 540 Ma of Earths history. Simulations indicate biogeographic dating performs well so long as paleogeography imposes constraint on biogeographic character evolution. To gauge whether biogeographic dating may have any practical use, I analyze the well-studied turtle clade (Testudines) then assess how well biogeographic dating fares compared to heavily fossil-calibrated dating results as reported in the literature. Fossil-free biogeographic dating estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant turtles to be approximately 201 Ma, which is consistent with fossil-based estimates. Accuracy improves further when including a root node fossil calibration. The described model, paleogeographical dispersal graph, and analysis scripts are available for use with RevBayes."

10.1101/028787,"Complex gene expression patterns are mediated by binding of transcription factors (TF) to specific genomic loci. The in vivo occupancy of a TF is, in large part, determined by the TFs DNA binding interaction partners, motivating genomic context based models of TF occupancy. However, the approaches thus far have assumed a uniform binding model to explain genome wide bound sites for a TF in a cell-type and as such heterogeneity of TF occupancy models, and the extent to which binding rules underlying a TFs occupancy are shared across cell types, has not been investigated. Here, we develop an ensemble based approach (TRISECT) to identify heterogeneous binding rules of cell-type specific TF occupancy and analyze the inter-cell-type sharing of such rules. Comprehensive analysis of 23 TFs, each with ChIP-Seq data in 4-12 cell-types, shows that by explicitly capturing the heterogeneity of binding rules, TRISECT accurately identifies in vivo TF occupancy (93%) substantially improving upon previous methods. Importantly, many of the binding rules derived from individual cell-types are shared across cell-types and reveal distinct yet functionally coherent putative target genes in different cell-types. Closer inspection of the predicted cell-type-specific interaction partners provides insights into context-specific functional landscape of a TF. Together, our novel ensemble-based approach reveals, for the first time, a widespread heterogeneity of binding rules, comprising interaction partners within a cell-type, many of which nevertheless transcend cell-types. Notably, the putative targets of shared binding rules in different cell-types, while distinct, exhibit significant functional coherence."
10.1101/028803,"Background. Large mega base-pair genomic regions show robust alterations in DNA methylation levels in multiple cancers, a vast majority of which are hypo-methylated in cancers. These regions are generally bounded by CpG islands, overlap with Lamin Associated Domains and Large organized chromatin lysine modifications, and are associated with stochastic variability in gene expression. Given the size and consistency of hypo-methylated blocks (HMB) across cancer types, their immediate causes are likely to be encoded in the genomic region near HMB boundaries, in terms of specific genomic or epigenomic signatures. However, a detailed characterization of the HMB boundaries has not been reported.\n\nMethod. Here, we focused on ~13k HMBs, encompassing approximately half the genome, identified in colon cancer. We analyzed a number of distinguishing features at the HMB boundaries including transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, various epigenomic marks, and chromatin structural features.\n\nResult. We found that the classical promoter epigenomic mark - H3K4me3, is highly enriched at HMB boundaries, as are CTCF bound sites. HMB boundaries harbor distinct combinations of TF motifs. Our Random Forest model based on TF motifs can accurately distinguish boundaries not only from regions inside and outside HMBs, but surprisingly, from active promoters as well. Interestingly, the distinguishing TFs and their interacting proteins are involved in chromatin modification. Finally, HMB boundaries significantly coincide with the boundaries of Topologically Associating Domains of the chromatin.\n\nConclusion. Our analyses suggest that the overall architecture of HMBs is guided by pre-existing chromatin architecture, and are associated with aberrant activity of promoter-like sequences at the boundary."
10.1101/028795,"Phenotypic plasticity is an evolutionary driving force in diverse biological processes, including the adaptive immune system, the development of neoplasms, and the bacterial acquisition of drug resistance. It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Of particular importance is to understand how this advantage of phenotypic plasticity depends on the degree of heritability of non-genetically encoded phenotypes between generations, which can induce irreversible evolutionary changes in the population. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population otherwise composed of individuals who can express only a single phenotype. We analyze the fixation probability of such an allele as a function of the strength of inter-generational phenotypic heritability, called memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In a constant environment, the fixation probability of a plastic allele always increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic alleles fixation. This same optimum value of phenotypic memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome resistance, in a variety of diseases."
10.1101/028753,"Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets of populations. A useful methodological framework for this purpose are F-statistics, that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three and four populations, and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. Here, we put these statistics in context of phylogenetic and population genetic theory. We show how measures of genetic drift can be interpreted as branch lengths, paths through an admixture graph or in terms of the internal branches in coalescent trees. We show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing us to generalize applications for arbitrary phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, we derive novel expressions for the F-statistics, which enables us to explore the behavior of F-statistic under population structure models. In particular, we show that population substructure may complicate inference.\n\nAuthor SummaryFor the analysis of genetic data from hundreds of populations, a commonly used technique are a set of simple statistics on data from two, three and four populations. These statistics are used to test hypotheses involving the history of populations, in particular whether data is consistent with the history of a set of populations forming a tree.\n\nHere, we provide context to these statistics by deriving novel expressions and by relating them to approaches in comparative phylogenetics. These results are useful because they provide a straightforward interpretation of these statistics under many demographic processes and lead to simplified expressions. However, the result also reveals the limitations of F-statistics, in that population substructure may complicate inference."
10.1101/028811,"The amount of nanoparticles (NPs) in human environment is increasing. The main sources are the increased introduction in consumer products and air pollution (diesel exhaust). It is meanwhile common knowledge that NPs behave differently as bulk material because of their nano-size. This leads in general to a higher reactivity and some other changed properties, e.g. solubility, surface potential, conductivity, and, to different effects on biological systems. The main impacts of NPs on a cellular and organism level are meanwhile well known: release of toxic ions, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation. Beside these, there is increasing evidence that NPs, especially in low dose/long exposure scenarios, affect biological systems in a broader way, interact with drugs, and exacerbate the effects of diseases. To investigate these effects systems biology approaches are the method of choice. This review summarizes the state of the art of nanoparticle effects on cells and organisms and demonstrate the add value of systems biology investigations to NP hazard assessment.\n\nAbbreviations: nanoparticle (NP), carbon nanotube (CNT), single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolization, excretion), PAMAM (poly(amidoamine)),"
10.1101/028746,Cancers arise from genetic abberations but also consistently display high levels of intra-tumor heterogeneity and evolve according to Darwinian dynamics. This makes evolutionary game theory an ideal tool in which to mathematically capture these cell-cell interactions and in which to investigate how they impact evolutionary dynamics. In this chapter we present some examples of how evolutionary game theory can elucidate cancer evolution.
10.1101/028837,"Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new combinatorial method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (non-clonal) RAD fragments and produces better data for both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e. very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science."
10.1101/028878,"Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis relates genetic variation to gene expression, and it has been shown that power to detect eQTLs is substantially increased by adjustment for measures of expression variability derived from singular value decomposition-based procedures (referred to as expression factors, or EFs). A potential downside to this approach is that power will be reduced for eQTL that are correlated with one or more EFs, but these approaches are commonly used in human eQTL studies on the assumption that this risk is low for cis (i.e. local) eQTL associations. Using two independent blood eQTL datasets, we show that this assumption is incorrect and that, in fact, 10-25% of eQTL that are significant without adjustment for EFs are no longer detected after EF adjustment. In addition, the majority of these \""lost\"" eQTLs replicate in independent data, indicating that they are not spurious associations. Thus, in the ideal case, EFs would be re-estimated for each eQTL association test, as has been suggested by others; however, this is computationally infeasible for large datasets with densely imputed genotype data. We propose an alternative, \""buffet-style\"" approach in which a series of EF and non-EF eQTL analyses are performed and significant eQTL discoveries are collected across these analyses. We demonstrate that standard methods to control the false discovery rate perform similarly between the single EF and buffet-style approaches, and we provide biological support for eQTL discovered by this approach in terms of immune cell-type specific enhancer enrichment in Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE cell lines.\n\nSignificance Statement: Genetic differences between individuals cause disease through their effects on the function of cells and tissues. One of the important biological changes affected by genetic differences is the expression of genes, which can be identified with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis. Here we explore the basic methods for performing eQTL analysis, and we identify some underappreciated negative impacts of commonly applied methods, and propose a practical solution to improve the ability to identify genetic differences that affect gene expression levels, thereby improving the ability to understand the biological causes of many common diseases."
10.1101/028845,"Oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC) are a homogenous group of tumors characterized by aggressive behavior, early spread to lymph nodes and a higher rate of regional failure. Additionally, the incidence of OTSCC among younger population (<50yrs) is on a rise; many of who lack the typical associated risk factors of alcohol and/or tobacco exposure. We present data on SNVs, indels, regions with LOH, and CNVs from fifty-paired oral tongue primary tumors and link the significant somatic variants with clinical parameters, epidemiological factors including HPV infection and tumor recurrence. Apart from the frequent somatic variants harbored in TP53, CASP8, RASA1, NOTCH and CDKN2A genes, significant amplifications and/or deletions were detected in chromosomes 6-9, and 11 in the tumors. Variants in CASP8 and CDKN2A were mutually exclusive. CDKN2A, P1K3CA, RASA1 and DMD variants were exclusively linked to smoking, chewing, HPV infection and tumor stage. We also performed whole-genome gene expression study that identified matrix metalloproteases to be highly expressed in tumors and linked pathways involving arachidonic acid and NF-{kappa}-B to habits and distant metastasis, respectively. Functional knockdown studies in cell lines demonstrated the role of CASP8 in HPV-negative OTSCC cell line. Finally, we identified a 38-gene minimal signature that predicts tumor recurrence using an ensemble machine learning method. Taken together, this study links molecular signatures to various clinical and epidemiological factors in a homogeneous tumor population with a relatively high HPV prevalence."
10.1101/028902,"The quantitative characterization of mutational landscapes is a task of outstanding importance in evolutionary and medical biology: It is, e.g., of central importance for our understanding of the phenotypic effect of mutations related to disease and antibiotic drug resistance. Here we develop a novel inference scheme for mutational landscapes, which is based on the statistical analysis of large alignments of homologs of the protein of interest. Our method is able to capture epistatic couplings between residues, and therefore to assess the dependence of mutational effects on the sequence context where they appear. Compared to recent large-scale mutagenesis data of the beta-lactamase TEM-1, a protein providing resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, our method leads to an increase of about 40% in explicative power as compared to approaches neglecting epistasis. We find that the informative sequence context extends to residues at native distances of about 20 from the mutated site, reaching thus far beyond residues in direct physical contact."
10.1101/028894,"Potential time trends in relative humidity (RH) were investigated for the Kamloops climate station in a semi-arid region of south-central British Columbia, Canada, between 1990 and 2012. Mean monthly 6 am and 3 pm RH at Kamloops achieve annual minima during the March to September period with substantially higher early morning RH compared to the mid-afternoon period. Significant temporal declines in RH throughout the year are evident ranging from 1.5 to 5.7%/decade. No significantly increasing temporal trends in RH were found. The findings indicate that a continuation of declining trends in RH for the study area may increase the quantity of dust and other atmospheric particulate generation from both natural and anthropogenic sources, possibly resulting in additional threats to local and regional air quality, thereby necessitating inclusion in air quality management planning and modeling efforts."
10.1101/028910,"Primary neocortical sensory areas act as central hubs, distributing afferent information to numerous cortical and subcortical structures. However, it remains unclear whether each downstream target receives distinct versions of sensory information. We used in vivo calcium imaging combined with retrograde tracing to monitor visual response properties of three distinct subpopulations of projection neurons in primary visual cortex. While there is overlap across the groups, on average corticotectal (CT) cells exhibit lower contrast thresholds and broader tuning for orientation and spatial frequency in comparison to corticostriatal (CS) cells, while corticocortical (CC) cells have intermediate properties. Noise correlational analyses support the hypothesis that CT cells integrate information across diverse layer 5 populations, whereas CS and CC cells form more selectively interconnected groups. Overall, our findings demonstrate the existence of functional subnetworks within layer 5 that may differentially route visual information to behaviorally relevant downstream targets."
10.1101/028951,"INTRODUCTION: Ebbert et al. reported gene-gene interactions between rs11136000-rs670139 (CLU-MS4A4E) and rs3865444-rs670139 (CD33-MS4A4E). We evaluate these interactions in the largest dataset for an epistasis study.\n\nMETHODS: We tested interactions using 3837 cases and 4145 controls from ADGC using meta-and permutation analyses. We repeated meta-analyses stratified by APOE{varepsilon}4 status, estimated combined OR and population attributable fraction (cPAF), and explored causal variants.\n\nRESULTS: Results support the CLU-MS4A4E interaction and a dominant effect. An association between CLU-MS4A4E and APOE{varepsilon}4 negative status exists. The estimated synergy factor, OR, and cPAF for rs11136000-rs670139 are 2.23, 2.45 and 8.0, respectively. We identified potential causal variants.\n\nDISCUSSION: We replicated the CLU-MS4A4E interaction in a large case-control series, with APOE{varepsilon}4 and possible dominant effect. The CLU-MS4A4E OR is higher than any Alzheimers disease locus except APOE{varepsilon}4, APP, and TREM2. We estimated an 8% decrease in Alzheimers disease incidence without CLU-MS4A4E risk alleles and identified potential causal variants."
10.1101/028985,"BackgroundThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of folding for membrane and secreted proteins. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR can promote survival by reducing the load of unfolded proteins through upregulation of chaperones and global attenuation of protein synthesis. However, when ER stress is acute or prolonged cells undergo apoptosis. In this study we sought to determine the effect of globally compromised microRNA biogenesis on the UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis\n\nResultsHere we report the role of Dicer-dependent miRNA biogenesis during the UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis. We show that ER stress-induced caspase activation and apoptosis is attenuated in Dicer deficient fibroblasts. ER stress-mediated induction of GRP78, the key ER resident chaperone, and also HERP, an important component of ER-associated degradation, are significantly increased in Dicer deficient cells. Expression of the BCL-2 family members BIM and MCL1 were significantly higher in Dicer-null fibroblasts. However, ER stress-mediated induction of pro-apoptotic BH3 only protein BIM was compromised in Dicer mutant cells.\n\nConclusionsThese observations demonstrate key roles for Dicer in the UPR and implicate miRNAs as critical components of UPR."
10.1101/028969,"Leishmania, a genus of parasites transmitted to human hosts and mammalian/reptilian reservoirs by an insect vector, is the causative agent of the human disease complex leishmaniasis. The evolutionary relationships within the genus Leishmania and its origins are the source of ongoing debate, reflected in conflicting phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions. This study employs a recently described bioinformatics method, SISRS, to identify over 200,000 informative sites across the genome from newly sequenced and publicly available Leishmania data. This dataset is used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of this genus. Additionally, we constructed a large multi-gene dataset; we used this dataset to reconstruct the phylogeny and estimate divergence dates for species. We conclude that the genus Leishmania evolved at least 90-100 million years ago. Our results support the hypothesis that Leishmania clades separated prior to, and during, the breakup of Gondwana. Additionally, we confirm that reptile-infecting Leishmania are derived from mammalian forms, and that the species that infect porcupines and sloths form a clade long separated from other species. We also firmly place the guinea-pig infecting species, L. enrietti, the globally dispersed L. siamensis, and the newly identified Australia species from kangaroos as sibling species whose distribution arises from the ancient connection between Australia, Antarctica, and South America."
10.1101/028886,"Somatic mutations are the driving force of cancer genome evolution1. The rate of somatic mutations appears in great variability across the genome due to chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing2-5. However, other variables that may influence the mutation rate locally, such as DNA-binding proteins, are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the rate of somatic mutations in melanoma tumors is highly increased at active Transcription Factor binding sites (TFBS) and nucleosome embedded DNA, compared to their flanking regions. Using recently available excision-repair sequencing (XR-seq) data6, we show that the higher mutation rate at these sites is caused by a decrease of the levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. Therefore, our work demonstrates that DNA-bound proteins interfere with the NER machinery, which results in an increased rate of mutations at their binding sites. This finding has important implications in our understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and in the identification of cancer driver mutations."
10.1101/028993,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an essential differentiation program during tissue morphogenesis and remodeling. EMT is induced by soluble transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}) family members, and restricted by vascular endothelial growth factor family members. While many downstream molecular regulators of EMT have been identified, these have been largely evaluated individually without considering potential crosstalk. In this study, we created an ensemble of dynamic mathematical models describing TGF-{beta} induced EMT to better understand the operational hierarchy of this complex molecular program. We used ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the transcriptional and post-translational regulatory events driving EMT. Model parameters were estimated from multiple data sets using multiobjective optimization, in combination with cross-validation. TGF-{beta} exposure drove the model population toward a mesenchymal phenotype, while an epithelial phenotype was enhanced following vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) exposure. Simulations predicted that the transcription factors phosphorylated SP1 and NFAT were master regulators promoting or inhibiting EMT, respectively. Surprisingly, simulations also predicted that a cellular population could exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity (characterized by a significant fraction of the population with both high epithelial and mesenchymal marker expression) if treated simultaneously with TGF-{beta} and VEGF-A. We tested this prediction experimentally in both MCF10A and DLD1 cells and found that upwards of 45% of the cellular population acquired this hybrid state in the presence of both TGF-{beta} and VEGF-A. We experimentally validated the predicted NFAT/Sp1 signaling axis for each phenotype response. Lastly, we found that cells in the hybrid state had significantly different functional behavior when compared to VEGF-A or TGF-{beta} treatment alone. Together, these results establish a predictive mechanistic model of EMT susceptibility, and potentially reveal a novel signaling axis which regulates carcinoma progression through an EMT versus tubulogenesis response.\n\nAuthor SummaryTissue formation and remodeling requires a complex and dynamic balance of interactions between epithelial cells, which reside on the surface, and mesenchymal cells that reside in the tissue interior. During embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer, epithelial cells transform into a mesenchymal cell to form new types of tissues. It is important to understand this process so that it can be controlled to generate beneficial effects and limit pathological differentiation. Much research over the past 20 years has identified many different molecular species that are relevant, but these have mainly been studied one at a time. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel computational strategy to interrogate the key players in this transformation process to identify which are the major bottlenecks. We determined that NFATc1 and pSP1 are essential for promoting epithelial or mesenchymal differentiation, respectively. We then predicted the existence of a partially transformed cell that exhibits both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. We found this partial cell type develops a network of invasive but stunted vascular structures that may be a unique cell target for understanding cancer progression and angiogenesis."
10.1101/028936,"Inverse statistical approaches to determine protein structure and function from Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in computational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship between the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and energetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to benchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable sequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts Hamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce many important aspects of  true LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis reveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend not only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds; in particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization of native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing folds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred Potts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able to generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired folds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are remarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are not simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our findings elucidate the reasons of the power of inverse approaches to the modelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations; we show, in particular, that their success crucially depend on the accurate inference of the Potts pairwise couplings.\n\nAuthor SummaryInverse statistical approaches, modeling pairwise correlations between amino acids in the sequences of similar proteins across many different organisms, can successfully extract protein structure (contact) information. Here, we benchmark those statistical approaches on exactly solvable models of proteins, folding on a 3D lattice, to assess the reasons underlying their success and their limitations. We show that the inferred parameters (effective pairwise interactions) of the statistical models have clear and quantitative interpretations in terms of positive (favoring the native fold) and negative (disfavoring competing folds) protein sequence design. New sequences randomly drawn from the statistical models are likely to fold into the native structures when effective pairwise interactions are accurately inferred, a performance which cannot be achieved with independent-site models."
10.1101/028977,"Recently, a new Chlamydia-related organism, Protochlamydia naegleriophila KNic, was discovered within a Naegleria amoeba. To decipher the mechanisms at play in the modeling of genomes from the Protochlamydia genus, we sequenced de novo the full genome of Pr. naegleriophila combining the advantages of two second-generation sequencing technologies. The assembled complete genome comprises a 2,885,111 bp chromosome and a 145,285 bp megaplasmid. For the first time within the Chlamydiales order, a CRISPR system, the immune system of bacteria, was discovered on the chromosome. It is composed of a small CRISPR locus comprising eight repeats and the associated cas and cse genes of the subtype I-E. A CRISPR locus was also found within Chlamydia sp. Diamant, another Pr. naegleriophila strain whose genome was recently released, suggesting that the CRISPR system was acquired by a common ancestor of these two members of Pr. naegleriophila, after the divergence from Pr. amoebophila. The plasmid encodes an F-type conjugative system similar to that found in the Pam100G genomic island of Pr. amoebophila suggesting an acquisition of this conjugative system before the divergence of both Protochlamydia species and the integration of a putative Pr. amoebophila plasmid into its main chromosome giving rise to the Pam100G genomic island. Overall, this new Pr. naegleriophila genome sequence enables to investigate further the dynamic processes shaping the genomes of Chlamydia-related bacteria."
10.1101/029041,"Existing methods for interpreting protein variation focus on annotating mutation pathogenicity rather than detailed interpretation of variant deleteriousness and frequently use only sequence-based or structure-based information. We present VIPUR, a computational framework that seamlessly integrates sequence analysis and structural modeling (using the Rosetta protein modeling suite) to identify and interpret deleterious protein variants. To train VIPUR, we collected 9,477 protein variants with known effects on protein function from multiple organisms and curated structural models for each variant from crystal structures and homology models. VIPUR can be applied to mutations in any organisms proteome with improved generalized accuracy (AUROC .83) and interpretability (AUPR .87) compared to other methods. We demonstrate that VIPUR s predictions of deleteriousness match the biological phenotypes in ClinVar and provide a clear ranking of prediction confidence. We use VIPUR to interpret known mutations associated with inflammation and diabetes, demonstrating the structural diversity of disrupted functional sites and improved interpretation of mutations associated with human diseases. Lastly we demonstrate VIPUR s ability to highlight candidate genes associated with human diseases by applying VIPUR to de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorders."
10.1101/029116,"Auto regulatory feedback loops occur in the regulation of molecules ranging from ATP to MAP kinases to zinc. Negative feedback loops can increase a systems robustness, while positive feedback loops can mediate transitions between cell states. Recent genome-wide experimental and computational studies predict hundreds of novel feedback loops. However, not all physical interactions are regulatory, and many experimental methods cannot detect self-interactions. Our understanding of regulatory feedback loops is therefore hampered by the lack of high-throughput methods to experimentally quantify the presence, strength, and temporal dynamics of auto regulatory feedback loops. Here we present a mathematical and experimental framework for high-throughput quantification of feedback regulation, and apply it to RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in yeast. Our method is able to determine the existence of both direct and indirect positive and negative feedback loops, and to quantify the strength of these loops. We experimentally validate our model using two RBPs which lack native feedback loops, and by the introduction of synthetic feedback loops. We find that the the RBP Puf3 does not natively participate in any direct or indirect feedback regulation, but that replacing the native 3UTR with that of COX17 generates an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop which reduces gene expression noise. Likewise, the RBP Pub1 does not natively participate in any feedback loops, but a synthetic positive feedback loop involving Pub1 results in increased expression noise. Our results demonstrate a synthetic experimental system for quantifying the existence and strength of feedback loops using a combination of high-throughput experiments and mathematical modeling. This system will be of great use in measuring auto-regulatory feedback by RNA binding proteins, a regulatory motif that is difficult to quantify using existing high-throughput methods."
10.1101/029066,"We present an effective model All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The model describes a key architectural feature of ATRA-induced differentiation, positive feedback between an ATRA-inducible signalsome complex involving many proteins including Vav1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The model, which was developed by integrating logical rules with kinetic modeling, was significantly smaller than previous models. However, despite its simplicity, it captured key features of ATRA induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. We identified an ensemble of effective model parameters using measurements taken from ATRA-induced HL-60 cells. Using these parameters, model analysis predicted that MAPK activation was bistable as a function of ATRA exposure. Conformational experiments supported ATRA-induced bistability. These findings, combined with other literature evidence, suggest that positive feedback is central to a diversity of cell fate programs.\n\nIndex Terms--Mathematical modeling, systems biology"
10.1101/029033,"Over the last decade tremendous progress has been made towards a comparative understanding of gene regulatory evolution. However, we know little about how gene regulation evolves in birds, and how divergent genomes interact in their hybrids. Because of unique features of birds - female heterogamety, a highly conserved karyotype, and the slow evolution of reproductive incompatibilities - an understanding of regulatory evolution in birds is critical to a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution and its implications for speciation. Using a novel complement of analyses of replicated RNA-seq libraries, we demonstrate abundant divergence in gene expression between subspecies of zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. By comparing parental populations and their F1 hybrids, we also show that gene misexpression is relatively rare, a pattern that may partially explain the slow buildup of postzygotic reproductive isolation observed in birds relative to other taxa. Although we expected that the action of genetic drift on the island-dwelling zebra finch subspecies would be manifested in a high rate of trans regulatory divergence, we found that most divergence was in cis regulation, following a pattern commonly observed in other taxa. Thus our study highlights both unique and shared features of avian regulatory evolution."
10.1101/029017,"We evaluated the fraction of variation in HIV-1 set point viral load attributable to viral or human genetic factors by using joint host/pathogen genetic data from 541 HIV infected individuals. We show that viral genetic diversity explains 29% of the variation in viral load while host factors explain 8.4%. Using a joint model including both host and viral effects, we estimate a total of 30% heritability, indicating that most of the host effects are reflected in viral sequence variation."
10.1101/029090,"Recording the activity of neural populations at high sampling rates is a fundamental requirement for understanding computation in neural circuits. Two photon microscopy provides one promising approach towards this. However, neural circuits are three dimensional, and functional imaging in two dimensions fails to capture the 3D nature of neural dynamics. Electrically tunable lenses (ETLs) provide a simple and cheap method to extend laser scanning microscopy into the relatively unexploited third dimension. We have therefore incorporated them into our Adaptive Spiral Scanning (SSA) algorithm, which calculates kinematically efficient scanning strategies using radially modulated spiral paths. We characterised the response of the ETL, incorporated its dynamics using MATLAB models of the SSA algorithm and tested the models on populations of Izhikevich neurons of varying size and density. From this, we show that our algorithms can theoretically at least achieve sampling rates of 36.2Hz compared to 21.6Hz previously reported for 3D scanning techniques."
10.1101/029108,"This study investigates the spatial and directional tuning of Multi-Unit Activity (MUA) in mouse primary visual cortex and how MUA can reflect spatiotemporal structures contained in moving gratings. Analysis of multi-shank laminar electrophysiological recordings from mouse primary visual cortex indicates a directional preference for moving gratings around 180{degrees}, while preferred spatial frequency peaks around 0.02 cycles per degree, which is similar as reported in single-unit studies. Using only features from MUA, we further achieved a significant performance in decoding spatial frequency or direction of moving gratings, with average decoding performances of up to 58.54% for 8 directions, and 44% correctly identified spatial frequencies against chance level of 16.7%."
10.1101/029140,"This is a review. Non-electrolytic compounds typically cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. The rate of permeation is dependent on the chemical properties of the solute and the composition of the lipid bilayer membrane. Predicting the permeability coefficient of a solute is important in pharmaceutical chemistry and toxicology. Molecular simulation has proven to be a valuable tool for modeling permeation of solutes through a lipid bilayer. In particular, the solubility-diffusion model has allowed for the quantitative calculation of permeability coefficients. The underlying theory and computational methods used to calculate membrane permeability are reviewed. We also discuss applications of these methods to examine the permeability of solutes and the effect of membrane composition on permeability. The application of coarse grain and polarizable models is discussed."
10.1101/029009,"Background In planarian flatworms, the mechanisms underlying the activity of collectively pluripotent adult stem cells (neoblasts) and their descendants can now be studied from the level of the individual gene to the entire animal. Flatworms maintain startling developmental plasticity and regenerative capacity in response to variable nutrient conditions or injury. We develop a model for cell dynamics in such animals, using methods of nonlinear dynamics, assuming that fully differentiated cells exert feedback control on neoblast activity. Results Our model predicts a number of whole organism level and general cell biological and behaviours, some of which have been empirically observed or inferred in planarians and others that have not. As previously observed empirically we find: 1) a curvilinear relationship between external food and planarian steady state size; 2) the fraction of neoblasts in the steady state is constant regardless of planarian size; 3) a burst of controlled apoptosis during regeneration after amputation as the number of differentiated cells are adjusted towards their correct homeostatic/steady state level. In addition our model describes the following properties that can inform and be tested by future experiments: 4) the strength of feedback control from differentiated cells to neoblasts (i.e. the activity of the signalling system) and from neoblasts on themselves in relation to absolute number depends upon the level of food in the environment; 5) planarians adjust size when food level reduces initially through increased apoptosis and then through a reduction in neoblast self-renewal activity; 6) following wounding or excision of differentiated cells, different time scales characterize both recovery of size and the two feedback functions; 7) the temporal pattern of feedback controls differs noticeably during recovery from a removal or neoblasts or a removal of differentiated cells; and 8) the signaling strength for apoptosis of differentiated cells depends upon both the absolute and relative deviations of the number of differentiated cells from their homeostatic level.\n\nConclusions We offer the first analytical framework for organizing experiments on planarian flatworm stem cell dynamics in a form that allows models to be compared with quantitative cell data based on underlying molecular mechanisms and thus facilitates the interplay between empirical studies and modeling. This framework is the foundation for studying cell migration during wound repair, the determination of homeostatic levels of differentiated cells by natural selection, and stochastic effects."

10.1101/029132,"Autism (AUT), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD) are three highly heritable neuropsychiatric conditions. Clinical similarities and genetic overlap between the three disorders have been reported; however, the causes and the downstream effects of this overlap remain elusive. By analyzing transcriptomic RNA-Sequencing data generated from post-mortem cortical brain tissues from AUT, SCZ, BPD and control subjects, we have begun to characterize the extent of gene expression overlap between these disorders. We report that the AUT and SCZ transcriptomes are significantly correlated (p<0.001), while the other two cross disorder comparisons (AUT-BPD, SCZ-BPD) are not. Among AUT and SCZ, we find that the genes differentially expressed across disorders are involved in neurotransmission and synapse regulation. Despite lack of global transcriptomic overlap across all three disorders, we highlight two genes, IQSEC3 and COPS7A, which are significantly down-regulated compared to controls across all three disorders, suggesting either shared etiology or compensatory changes across these neuropsychiatric conditions. Finally, we tested for enrichment of genes differentially expressed across disorders in genetic association signals in AUT, SCZ or BPD, reporting lack of signal in any of the previously published GWAS. Together, these studies highlight the importance of examining gene expression from the primary tissue involved in neuropsychiatric conditions, cortical brain. We identify a shared role for altered neurotransmission and synapse regulation in AUT and SCZ, in addition to two genes that may more generally contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions."
10.1101/029124,"Fast and accurate detection of action potentials from neurophysiological data is key to the study of information processing in the nervous system. Previous work has shown that finite rate of innovation (FRI) theory can be used to successfully reconstruct spike trains from noisy calcium imaging data. This is due to the fact that calcium imaging data can be modeled as streams of decaying exponentials which are a subclass of FRI signals. Recent progress in the development of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) has produced protein calcium sensors that exceed the sensitivity of the synthetic dyes traditionally used in calcium imaging experiments. In this paper, we compare the suitability for spike detection of the kinetics of a new family of GECIs (the GCaMP6 family) with the synthetic dye Oregon Green BAPTA-1. We demonstrate the high performance of the FRI algorithm on surrogate data for each calcium indicator and we calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the uncertainty of the position of a detected spike in calcium imaging data for each calcium indicator."
10.1101/029082,"1I use a set of machines based on the concept of nested rule systems built on the a modified version of the Wolfram elemental cellular automata to investigate the role of recombination in providing resistance to ageing. Class III and class IV machines are observed to respond differently to recombination. Class IV machines show recombinational centring in their neutral networks whereas class III machines respond negatively to recombination. Rule 110 shows a unusual response to recombination. Recombination selects for resistance to recombination, the population moves to regions of genome space with high redundancy, this results in organisms with highly robust genomes, more likely to complete development and to be long lived. The increase in longevity may be sufficient to compensate for the costs of sex, including the two fold cost of sex, through increased reproductive potential in long lived organisms requiring long maturation times. Large complex species should therefore be resistant to invasion by asexual mutants whereas small simple organisms with early maturation should be vulnerable to invasion by asexual forms."
10.1101/029165,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_LIMatrix models or integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used to study the dynamics of structured populations, where discrete or continuous traits influence survival, growth, or reproduction. When a populations size is small, as is often the case for threatened species or potentially invasive species arriving in novel habitats, extinction risk may be substantial due to demographic stochasticity.\nC_LIO_LIBranching processes, which are individual-based counterparts to matrix models and IPMs, allow one to quantify these risks of extinction. For discretely structured populations, the theory of multi-type branching processes provides analytic methods to compute how extinction risk changes over time and how it depends on the size and composition of the population. Building on prior work on continuous-state branching processes, we extend these analytic methods to individual-based models accounting for any mixture of discrete and continuous population structure.\nC_LIO_LIThe individual-based IPMs are defined by probabilistic update rules at the level of the individual which determine how each individual with a given trait value dies, changes trait value (e.g. grows in size), or produces individuals with the same or other trait values. Probabilities of extinction are shown to be analytically determined by probability generating functionals associated with the individual-based IPMs. In particular, we present analytical expressions for how extinction probabilities change over time and depend on the initial abundance and trait distribution of the population. We illustrate how to numerically implement these methods using data from the short-lived desert shrub species Cryptantha flava, and provide a more general discussion of how to implement these methods to other data sets including those involving fluctuating environmental conditions.\nC_LIO_LIAs most IPM studies have the necessary data to parameterize individual-based IPMs, these methods provide a computationally efficient means to explore how continuously structured populations differing in their evolutionary history and environmental context may differ in their vulnerability to extinction or ability to colonize new habitats.\nC_LI"

We address whether disruption in hybrid seed development is the primary source of reproductive isolation between these sympatric taxa.\nC_LIO_LIM. guttatus and M. nudatus differ in the pattern and timing of endosperm and embryo development. Some hybrid seed exhibit early disruption of endosperm development and are completely inviable, while others develop relatively normally at first, but later exhibit impaired endosperm proliferation and low germination success. These developmental patterns are reflected in mature hybrid seed, which are either small and flat (indicating little to no endosperm), or shriveled (indicating reduced endosperm volume). Hybrid seed inviability forms a potent reproductive barrier between M. guttatus and M. nudatus.\nC_LIO_LIWe shed light on the extent of developmental variation between closely related species within the M. guttatus species complex, an important ecological model system, and provide a partial mechanism for the hybrid barrier between M. guttatus and M. nudatus.\nC_LI"
10.1101/029173,"Genetic studies of African-Americans identify functional variants, elucidate historical and genealogical mysteries, and reveal basic biology. However, African-Americans have been under-represented in genetic studies, and little is known about nation-wide patterns of genomic diversity in the population. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of African-American genomic diversity using genotype data from nationally and regionally representative cohorts. We find higher African ancestry in southern United States compared to the North and West. We show that relatedness patterns track north- and west-bound routes followed during the Great Migration, suggesting that admixture occurred predominantly in the South prior to the Civil War and that ancestry-biased migration is responsible for regional differences in ancestry. Rare genetic traits among African-Americans can therefore be shared over long geographic distances along the Great Migration routes, yet their distribution over short distances remains highly structured. This study clarifies the role of recent demography in shaping African-American genomic diversity."
10.1101/029207,"Although single genes underlying several evolutionary adaptations have been identified, the genetic basis of complex, polygenic adaptations has been far more challenging to pinpoint. Here we report that the budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus has recently evolved resistance to citrinin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin. Applying a genome-wide test for selection on cis-regulation, we identified five genes involved in the citrinin response that are constitutively up-regulated in S. paradoxus. Four of these genes are necessary for resistance, and are also sufficient to increase the resistance of a sensitive strain when over-expressed. Moreover, cis-regulatory divergence in the promoters of these genes contributes to resistance, while exacting a cost in the absence of citrinin. Our results demonstrate how the subtle effects of individual regulatory elements can be combined, via natural selection, into a complex adaptation. Our approach can be applied to dissect the genetic basis of polygenic adaptations in a wide range of species.\n\nAuthor SummaryAdaptation via natural selection has been a subject of great interest for well over a century, yet we still have little understanding of its molecular basis. What are the genetic changes that are actually being selected? While single genes underlying several adaptations have been identified, the genetic basis of complex, polygenic adaptations has been far more challenging to pinpoint. The complex trait that we study here is the resistance of Saccharomyces yeast to a mycotoxin called citrinin, which is produced by many other species of fungi, and is a common food contaminant for both humans and livestock. We found that sequence changes in the promoters of at least three genes have contributed to citrinin resistance, by up-regulating their transcription even in the absence of citrinin. Higher expression of these genes confers a fitness advantage in the presence of citrinin, while exacting a cost in its absence-- a fitness tradeoff. Our results provide a detailed view of a complex adaptation, and our approach can be applied to polygenic adaptations in a wide range of species."
10.1101/029249,"Multiple experimental evolution studies on D. melanogaster in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that enhanced competitive ability evolved primarily through increased larval tolerance to nitrogenous wastes and increased larval feeding and foraging rate, at the cost of efficiency of food conversion to biomass, and this became the widely accepted view of how adaptation to larval crowding evolves in fruitflies. We recently showed that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolved greater competitive ability without evolving higher feeding rates, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater efficiency of food conversion to biomass, increased pupation height and, perhaps, greater urea/ammonia tolerance. This was a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster and was closer to the expectations from the theory of K-selection. At that time, we suggested two possible reasons for the differences in the phenotypic correlates of greater competitive ability seen in the studies with D. melanogaster and the other two species. First, that D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta had a very different genetic architecture of traits affecting competitive ability compared to the long-term, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster used in the earlier studies, either because the populations of the former two species were relatively recently wild-caught, or by virtue of being different species. Second, that the different evolutionary trajectories in D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta versus D. melanogaster were a reflection of differences in the manner in which larval crowding was imposed in the two sets of selection experiments. The D. melanogaster studies used a higher absolute density of eggs per unit volume of food, and a substantially larger total volume of food, than the studies on D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta. Here, we show that long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, descended from some of the populations used in the earlier studies, evolve essentially the same set of traits as the D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta crowding-adapted populations when subjected to a similar larval density at low absolute volumes of food. As in the case of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta, and in stark contrast to earlier studies with D. melanogaster, these crowding-adapted populations of D. melanogaster did not evolve greater larval feeding rates as a correlate of increased competitive ability. The present results clearly suggest that the suite of phenotypes through which the evolution of greater competitive ability is achieved in fruitflies depends critically not just on larval density per unit volume of food, but also on the total amount of food available in the culture vials. We discuss these results in the context of an hypothesis about how larval density and the height of the food column in culture vials might interact to alter the fitness costs and benefits of increased larval feeding rates, thus resulting in different routes to the evolution of greater competitive ability, depending on the details of exactly how the larval crowding was implemented."
10.1101/029199,"The Heliconius butterflies are a widely studied adaptive radiation of 46 species spread across Central and South America, several of which are known to hybridise in the wild. Here, we present a substantially improved assembly of the Heliconius melpomene genome, developed using novel methods that should be applicable to improving other genome assemblies produced using short read sequencing. Firstly, we whole genome sequenced a pedigree to produce a linkage map incorporating 99% of the genome. Secondly, we incorporated haplotype scaffolds extensively to produce a more complete haploid version of the draft genome. Thirdly, we incorporated ~20x coverage of Pacific Biosciences sequencing and scaffolded the haploid genome using an assembly of this long read sequence. These improvements result in a genome of 795 scaffolds, 275 Mb in length, with an L50 of 2.1 Mb, an N50 of 34 and with 99% of the genome placed and 84% anchored on chromosomes. We use the new genome assembly to confirm that the Heliconius genome underwent 10 chromosome fusions since the split with its sister genus Eueides, over a period of about 6 million years."
10.1101/029256,"Drugs of abuse implicate both reward learning and homeostatic regulation mechanisms of the brain. Theories of addiction, thus, have mostly depicted this phenomenon as pathology in either habit-based learning system or homeostatic mechanisms. Showing the limits of those accounts, we hypothesize that compulsive drug seeking arises from drugs hijacking a system that integrates homeostatic regulation mechanism with goal-directed action/behavior. Building upon a recently developed homeostatic reinforcement learning theory, we present a computational theory proposing that cocaine reinforces goal-directed drug-seeking due to its rapid homeostatic corrective effect, whereas its chronic use induces slow and long-lasting changes in homeostatic setpoint. Our theory accounts for key behavioral and neurobiological features of addiction, most notably, escalation of cocaine use, drug-primed craving and relapse, and individual differences underlying susceptibility to addiction. The theory also generates unique predictions about the mechanisms of cocaine-intake regulation and about cocaine-primed craving and relapse that are confirmed by new experiments.\n\nSignificanceChronic use of addictive drugs renders increased motivation in planning to obtain and consume the drugs, despite their adverse social, occupational, and health consequences. It is as if addicts gradually develop a strong need for the drug and use their cognitive abilities and the knowledge of their environment in order to fulfil that need. In this paper, we build a mathematical model of this conception of addiction and show through quantitative simulations that such a model actually behaves in the same way that human addicts or laboratory animals that are exposed to cocaine behave. For example, the model shows gradually increasing motivation for drugs, relapse after long periods of abstinence, and individual differences in susceptibility to addiction."
10.1101/029322,"The ascidian tunicate Corella inflata is relatively transparent compared to other solitary tunicates and the circulatory system can be visualized by injecting high molecular weight fluorescein labeled dextran into the beating heart or the large vessels at the ends of the heart. In addition, after staining with neutral red the movement of blood cells can be followed to further define and characterize the circulatory system. The heart is a gently curved tube with a constriction in the middle and extends across the width of the animal. As in other tunicates, pumping is peristaltic and periodically reverses direction. During the abvisceral directional phase blood leaves the anterior end of the heart in two asymmetric vessels that connect to the two sides of the branchial basket (or pharynx), in contrast to the direct connection between the heart and the endostyle seen in the commonly studied tunicate Ciona intestinalis. In Corella inflata blood then flows in both transverse directions through a complex system of ducts in the branchial basket into large ventral and dorsal vessels and then to the visceral organs in the posterior of the animal. During the advisceral phase blood leaves the posterior end of the heart in vessels that repeatedly bifurcate to fan into the stomach and gonads. Blood speed, determined by following individual cells, is high and pulsatory near the heart, but decreases and becomes more constant in peripheral regions. Estimated blood flow volume during one directional phase is greater than the total volume of the animal. Circulating blood cells are confined to vessels or ducts in the visible parts of the animal and retention of high molecular weight dextran in the vessels is comparable to that seen in vertebrates. These flow patterns are consistent with a closed circulatory network."
10.1101/029355,"Mechanics plays a key role in the development of higher organisms. However, working towards an understanding of this relationship is complicated by the fact that it has proven difficult to model the link between local forces generated at the subcellular level, and tissue deformation at the whole-embryo level. Here we propose an approach first developed for lipid bilayers and cell membranes, in which force-generation at the cytoskeletal level only enters the shape mechanics calculation in the form of local changes in preferred tissue curvature. This allows us to formulate the continuum mechanics problem purely in terms of tissue strains. Relaxing the system by lowering its mechanical energy yields global morphogenetic predictions that accommodate the tendency towards this local preferred curvature, without explicitly modeling force-generating mechanisms at the molecular level. Our computational framework, which we call SPHARMMECH, extends a three-dimensional spherical harmonics parameterization known as SPHARM to combine this level of abstraction with a sparse shape representation. The integration of these two principles allows computer simulations to be performed in three dimensions, on highly complex shapes, gene expression patterns, and mechanical constraints.\n\nWe demonstrate our approach by modeling mesoderm invagination in the fruit-fly embryo, where local forces generated by the acto-myosin meshwork in the region of the future mesoderm lead to formation of a ventral tissue fold. The process is accompanied by substantial changes in cell shape and long-range cell movements. Applying SPHARM-MECH to whole-embryo live imaging data acquired with light-sheet microscopy reveals significant correlation between calculated and observed tissue movements. Our analysis predicts the observed cell shape anisotropy on the ventral side of the embryo and suggests an active mechanical role of mesoderm invagination in supporting the onset of germ-band extension."
10.1101/029306,"Genome assemblies that are accurate, complete, and contiguous are essential for identifying important structural and functional elements of genomes and for identifying genetic variation. Nevertheless, most recent genome assemblies remain incomplete and fragmented. While long molecule sequencing promises to deliver more complete genome assemblies with fewer gaps, concerns about error rates, low yields, stringent DNA requirements, and uncertainty about best practices may discourage many investigators from adopting this technology. Here, in conjunction with the platinum standard Drosophila melanogaster reference genome, we analyze recently published long molecule sequencing data to identify what governs completeness and contiguity of genome assemblies. We also present a hybrid meta-assembly approach that achieves remarkable assembly contiguity for both Drosophila and human assemblies with only modest long molecule sequencing coverage. Our results motivate a set of preliminary best practices for obtaining accurate and contiguous assemblies, a \""missing manual\"" that guides key decisions in building high quality de novo genome assemblies, from DNA isolation to polishing the assembly."
10.1101/029330,"Local non-linearities in dendrites render neuronal output dependent on the spatial distribution of synapses. A neuron will activate differently depending on whether active synapses are spatially clustered or dispersed. While this sensitivity can in principle expand neuronal computational capacity, it has thus far been employed in very few learning paradigms. To make use of this sensitivity, groups of correlated neurons need to make contact with distinct dendrites, and this requires a mechanism to ensure the correct distribution of synapses contacting from distinct ensembles. To address this problem, we introduce the requirement that on a short time scale, a pre-synaptic neuron makes a constant number of synapses with the same strength on a post-synaptic neuron. We find that this property enables clusters to distribute correctly and guarantees their functionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a change in the input statistics can reshape the spatial distribution of synapses. Finally, we show under which conditions clusters do not distribute correctly, e.g. when cross-talk between dendrites is too strong. As well as providing insight into potential biological mechanisms of learning, this work paves the way for new learning algorithms for artificial neural networks that exploit the spatial distribution of synapses."
10.1101/029348,"In this article I present a reproducible review of recent research to investigate the spatial positioning of neurons in the nervous system. In particular, I focus on the relative spatial positioning of pairs of cell types within the retina. I examine three different cases by which two types of neurons might be arranged relative to each other. (1) Cells of different type might be effectively independent of each other. (2) Cells of one type are randomly assigned one of two labels to create two related populations. (3) Interactions between cells of different type generate functional dependencies. I show briefly how spatial statistic techniques can be applied to investigate the nature of spatial interactions between two cell types. Finally, I have termed this article a  reproducible review because all the data and computer code are integrated into the manuscript so that others can repeat the analysis presented here. I close the review with a discussion of this concept."
10.1101/029363,"Ursids (bears) in general, and giant pandas in particular, are highly altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1-6 (Phase 1), days 7-20 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth."
10.1101/029314,"Object similarity, in brain representations and conscious perception, must reflect a combination of the visual appearance of the objects on the one hand and the categories the objects belong to on the other. Indeed, visual object features and category membership have each been shown to contribute to the object representation in human inferior temporal (IT) cortex, as well as to object-similarity judgments. However, the explanatory power of features and categories has not been directly compared. Here, we investigate whether the IT object representation and similarity judgments are best explained by a categorical or a feature-based model. We use rich models (> 100 dimensions) generated by human observers for a set of 96 real-world object images. The categorical model consists of a hierarchically nested set of category labels (such as \""human\"", \""mammal\"", \""animal\""). The feature model includes both object parts (such as \""eye\"", \""tail\"", \""handle\"") and other descriptive features (such as \""circular\"", \""green\"", \""stubbly\""). We used nonnegative least squares to fit the models to the brain representations (estimated from functional magnetic resonance imaging data) and to similarity judgments. Model performance was estimated on held-out images not used in fitting. Both models explained significant variance in IT and the amounts explained were not significantly different. The combined model did not explain significant additional IT variance, suggesting that it is the shared model variance (features correlated with categories, categories correlated with features) that best explains IT. The similarity judgments were almost fully explained by the categorical model, which explained significantly more variance than the feature-based model. The combined model did not explain significant additional variance in the similarity judgments. Our findings suggest that IT uses features that help to distinguish categories as stepping stones toward a semantic representation. Similarity judgments contain additional categorical variance that is not explained by visual features, reflecting a higher-level more purely semantic representation."
10.1101/029405,"Abstract Flexible information routing fundamentally underlies the function of many biological and artificial networks. Yet, how such systems may specifically communicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective dynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective dynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing patterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy measures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of this generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how individual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to systematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular architectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local interventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local network-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing information routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs with a communication function."
10.1101/029439,"We have shown earlier that the evolution of rapid development is accompanied by a correlated decrease in larval feeding rate and competitive ability in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Prasad et al. 2001; Shakarad et al. 2005). Here, we show that our faster developing populations have evolved higher hemocyte density and phenol oxidase activity in the larval hemolymph. The increased hemocyte density could be responsible for the evolution of decreased feeding rate as hemocytes and the cephalopharyngeal musculature share common embryonic precursor cells (Kraajiveld et al. 2001). We also show that the bacterial load in larval food vials of the faster developing populations is substantially higher than in controls. Our results suggest that the evolution of reduced competitive ability in the faster developing populations is probably due to larval feeding rate trading off with enhanced larval immune system function. Enhanced larval immune function, in turn, is most likely selected for due to the role of hemocytes (Lanot et al. 2001, Wood and Jacinto 2007) and phenol oxidase (Pentz et al. 1986) in development, and perhaps also due to inadvertent selection on immune performance resulting from the higher bacterial load faced by larvae in the faster developing populations."
10.1101/029371,"Substitution rates are known to be variable among genes, chromosomes, species, and lineages due to multifarious biological processes. Here we consider another source of substitution rate variation due to a technical bias associated with gene tree discordance, which has been found to be rampant in genome-wide datasets, often due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). This apparent substitution rate variation is caused when substitutions that occur on discordant gene trees are analyzed in the context of a single, fixed species tree. Such substitutions have to be resolved by proposing multiple substitutions on the species tree, and we therefore refer to this phenomenon as \""SPILS\"" (Substitutions Produced by Incomplete Lineage Sorting). We use simulations to demonstrate that SPILS has a larger effect with increasing levels of ILS, and on trees with larger numbers of taxa. Specific branches of the species trees are consistently, but erroneously, inferred to be longer or shorter, and we show that these branches can be predicted based on discordant tree topologies. Moreover, we observe that fixing a species tree topology when performing tests of positive selection increases the false positive rate, particularly for genes whose discordant topologies are most affected by SPILS. Finally, we use data from multiple Drosophila species to show that SPILS can be detected in nature. While the effects of SPILS are modest per gene, it has the potential to affect substitution rate variation whenever high levels of ILS are present, particularly in rapid radiations. The problems outlined here have implications for character mapping of any type of trait, and for any biological process that causes discordance. We discuss possible solutions to these problems, and areas in which they are likely to have caused faulty inferences of convergence and accelerated evolution."
10.1101/029397,"Viruses interact with hundreds to thousands of proteins in mammals, yet adaptation against viruses has only been studied in a few proteins specialized in antiviral defense. Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. Our results demonstrate that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes."
10.1101/029421,"Siberia and Western Russia are home to over 40 culturally and linguistically diverse indigenous ethnic groups. Yet, genetic variation of peoples from this region is largely uncharacterized. We present whole-genome sequencing data from 28 individuals belonging to 14 distinct indigenous populations from that region. We combine these datasets with additional 32 modern-day and 15 ancient human genomes to build and compare autosomal, Y-DNA and mtDNA trees. Our results provide new links between modern and ancient inhabitants of Eurasia. Siberians share 38% of ancestry with descendants of the 45,000-year-old Ust-Ishim people, who were previously believed to have no modern-day descendants. Western Siberians trace 57% of their ancestry to the Ancient North Eurasians, represented by the 24,000-year-old Siberian Malta boy. In addition, Siberians admixtures are present in lineages represented by Eastern European hunter-gatherers from Samara, Karelia, Hungary and Sweden (from 8,000-6,600 years ago), as well as Yamnaya culture people (5,300-4,700 years ago) and modern-day northeastern Europeans. These results provide new evidence of ancient gene flow from Siberia into Europe."
10.1101/029488,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, which greatly complicates the identification of genetic factors that contribute to the disease. Study designs have mainly focused on group differences between cases and controls. The problem is that, by their nature, group difference-based methods (e.g., differential expression analysis) blur or collapse the heterogeneity within groups. By ignoring genes with variable within-group expression, an important axis of genetic heterogeneity contributing to expression variability among affected individuals has been overlooked. To this end, we develop a new gene expression analysis method--aberrant gene expression analysis, based on the multivariate distance commonly used for outlier detection. Our method detects the discrepancies in gene expression dispersion between groups and identifies genes with significantly different expression variability. Using this new method, we re-visited RNA sequencing data generated from post-mortem brain tissues of 47 ASD and 57 control samples. We identified 54 functional gene sets whose expression dispersion in ASD samples is more pronounced than that in controls, as well as 76 co-expression modules present in controls but absent in ASD samples due to ASD-specific aberrant gene expression. We also exploited aberrantly expressed genes as biomarkers for ASD diagnosis. With a whole blood expression data set, we identified three aberrantly expressed gene sets whose expression levels serve as discriminating variables achieving >70% classification accuracy. In summary, our method represents a novel discovery and diagnostic strategy for ASD. Our findings may help open an expression variability-centered research avenue for other genetically heterogeneous disorders."
10.1101/029462,"Regularities in animal behaviour offer insight into the underlying organisational and functional principles of nervous systems and automated tracking provides the opportunity to extract features of behaviour directly from large-scale video data. Yet how to effectively analyse such behavioural data remains an open question. Here we explore whether a minimum description length principle can be exploited to identify meaningful behaviours and phenotypes. We apply a dictionary compression algorithm to behavioural sequences from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans freely crawling on an agar plate both with and without food and during chemotaxis. We find that the motifs identified by the compression algorithm are rare but relevant for comparisons between worms in different environments, suggesting that hierarchical compression can be a useful step in behaviour analysis. We also use compressibility as a new quantitative phenotype and find that the behaviour of wild-isolated strains of C. elegans is more compressible than that of the laboratory strain N2 as well as the majority of mutant strains examined. Importantly, in distinction to more conventional phenotypes such as overall motor activity or aggregation behaviour, the increased compressibility of wild isolates is not explained by the loss of function of the gene npr-1, which suggests that erratic locomotion is a laboratory-derived trait with a novel genetic basis. Because hierarchical compression can be applied to any sequence, we anticipate that compressibility can offer insight into the organisation of behaviour in other animals including humans."

10.1101/029454,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise in the embryo in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and the placenta, afterwards colonise the liver (and spleen) and finally the bone marrow, which, from birth on, remains the sole site of haematopoiesis. In mouse, after the fetal phase of rapid HSCs expansion, the number of these stem cells continues to increase after birth in order to sustain the growing blood volume of the developing infant. The number of total circulating reticulocytes seems to indicate that this growth stops around the third week of murine life, well before the whole animal stops to grow. Around the same time, a period of abundant lymphopoiesis ends. Human HSCs seem to show similar patterns during post-natal growth and these could be useful to understand the peculiar features of paediatric leukaemogenesis."
10.1101/029470,"The evolution of cooperation in group-structured populations has received much attention, but little is known about the effects of different modes of migration of individuals between groups. Here, we have incorporated four different modes of migration that differ in the degree of coordination among the individuals. For each mode of migration, we identify the set of multiplayer games in which the cooperative strategy has higher fixation probability than defection. The comparison shows that the set of games under which cooperation may evolve generally expands depending upon the degree of coordination among the migrating individuals. Weak altruism can evolve under all modes of individual migration, provided that the benefit to cost ratio is high enough. Strong altruism, however, evolves only if the mode of migration involves coordination of individual actions. Depending upon the migration frequency and degree of coordination among individuals, conditions that allow selection to work at the level of groups can be established."

Accurate estimations of true DNA methylation levels can be obtained from as few as several thousand short-reads generated from whole genome bisulfite sequencing.

10.1101/029512,"The brain has an impressive ability to withstand neural damage. Diseases that kill neurons can go unnoticed for years, and incomplete brain lesions or silencing of neurons often fail to produce any effect. How does the brain compensate for such damage, and what are the limits of this compensation? We propose that neural circuits optimally compensate for neuron death, thereby preserving their function as much as possible. We show that this compensation can explain changes in tuning curves induced by neuron silencing across a variety of systems, including the primary visual cortex. We find that optimal compensation can be implemented through the dynamics of networks with a tight balance of excitation and inhibition, without requiring synaptic plasticity. The limits of this compensatory mechanism are reached when excitation and inhibition become unbalanced, thereby demarcating a recovery boundary, where signal representation fails and where diseases may become symptomatic."

Twin studies indicate SRH has a heritability of up to 60% and that its genetic architecture may overlap with that of personality and cognition.\n\nMethodsWe carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of SRH on 111 749 members of the UK Biobank sample. Univariate genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)-GREML analyses were used to estimate the proportion of variance explained by all common autosomal SNPs for SRH. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) score regression and polygenic risk scoring, two complementary methods, were used to investigate pleiotropy between SRH in UK Biobank and up to 21 health-related and personality and cognitive traits from published GWAS consortia.\n\nResultsThe GWAS identified 13 independent signals associated with SRH, including several in regions previously associated with diseases or disease-related traits. The strongest signal was on chromosome 2 (rs2360675, p = 1.77x10-10) close to KLF7, which has previously been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A second strong peak was identified on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility region (rs76380179, p = 6.15x10-10). The proportion of variance in SRH that was explained by all common genetic variants was 13%. Polygenic scores for the following traits and disorders were associated with SRH: cognitive ability, education, neuroticism, BMI, longevity, ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, lung function, blood pressure, coronary artery disease, large vessel disease stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nConclusionsIndividual differences in how people respond to a single item on SRH are partly explained by their genetic propensity to many common psychiatric and physical disorders and psychological traits.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIGenetic variants associated with common diseases and psychological traits are associated with self-rated health.\nC_LIO_LIThe SNP-based heritability of self-rated health is 0.13 (SE 0.006).\nC_LIO_LIThere is pleiotropy between self-rated health and psychiatric and physical diseases and psychological traits.\nC_LI"
10.1101/029553,"Gene coexpression network modules provide a framework for identifying shared biological functions. Analysis of topological preservation of modules across datasets is important for assessing reproducibility, and can reveal common function between tissues, cell types, and species. Although module preservation statistics have been developed, heuristics have been required for significance testing. However, the scale of current and future analyses requires accurate and unbiased p-values, particularly to address the challenge of multiple testing. Here, we developed a rapid and efficient approach (NetRep) for assessing module preservation and show that module preservation statistics are typically non-normal, necessitating a permutation approach. Quantification of module preservation across brain, liver, adipose, and muscle tissues in a BxH mouse cross revealed complex patterns of multi-tissue preservation with 52% of modules showing unambiguous preservation in one or more tissues and 25% showing preservation in all four tissues. Phenotype association analysis uncovered a liver-derived gene module which harboured housekeeping genes and which also displayed adipose and muscle tissue specific association with body weight. Taken together, our study presents a rapid unbiased approach for testing preservation of gene network topology, thus enabling rigorous assessment of potentially conserved function and phenotype association analysis."
10.1101/029561,"Despite the global economic and ecological importance of forest trees, the genomic basis of differential adaptation and speciation in tree species is still poorly understood. Populus tremula and P. tremuloides are two of the most widespread tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Using whole-genome re-sequencing data of 24 P. tremula and 22 P. tremuloides individuals, we find that the two species diverged [~]2.2-3.1 million years ago, coinciding with the severing of the Bering land bridge and the onset of dramatic climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Both species have experienced substantial population expansions following long-term declines after species divergence. We detect widespread and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between species, and in accordance with the expectation of allopatric speciation, coalescent simulations suggest that neutral evolutionary processes can account for most of the observed patterns of genomic differentiation. However, there is an excess of regions exhibiting extreme differentiation relative to those expected under demographic simulations, which is indicative of the action of natural selection. Overall genetic differentiation is negatively associated with recombination rate in both species, providing strong support for a role of linked selection in generating the heterogeneous genomic landscape of differentiation between species. Finally, we identify a number of candidate regions and genes that may have been subject to positive and/or balancing selection during the speciation process."
10.1101/029520,"Research on the genetics of natural populations was revolutionized in the 1990s by methods for genotyping non-invasively collected samples. However, these methods have remained largely unchanged for the past 20 years and lag far behind the genomics era. To close this gap, here we report an optimized laboratory protocol for genome-wide capture of endogenous DNA from non-invasively collected samples, coupled with a novel computational approach to reconstruct pedigree links from the resulting low-coverage data. We validated both methods using fecal samples from 62 wild baboons, including 48 from an independently constructed extended pedigree. We enriched fecal-derived DNA samples up to 40-fold for endogenous baboon DNA, and reconstructed near-perfect pedigree relationships even with extremely low-coverage sequencing. We anticipate that these methods will be broadly applicable to the many research systems for which only non-invasive samples are available.

10.1101/029603,"The perceptual representation of individual faces is often explained with reference to a norm-based face space. In such spaces, individuals are encoded as vectors where identity is primarily conveyed by direction and distinctiveness by eccentricity. Here we measured human fMRI responses and psychophysical similarity judgments of individual face exemplars, which were generated as realistic 3D animations using a computer-graphics model. We developed and evaluated multiple neurobiologically plausible computational models, each of which predicts a representational distance matrix and a regional-mean activation profile for 24 face stimuli. In the fusiform face area, a face-space coding model with sigmoidal ramp tuning provided a better account of the data than one based on exemplar tuning. However, an image-processing model with weighted banks of Gabor filters performed similarly. Accounting for the data required the inclusion of a measurement-level population averaging mechanism that approximates how fMRI voxels locally average distinct neuronal tunings. Our study demonstrates the importance of comparing multiple models and of modeling the measurement process in computational neuroimaging.\n\nAuthor SummaryHumans recognize conspecifics by their faces. Understanding how faces are recognized is an open computational problem with relevance to theories of perception, social cognition, and the engineering of computer vision systems. Here we measured brain activity with functional MRI while human participants viewed individual faces. We developed multiple computational models inspired by known response preferences of single neurons in the primate visual cortex. We then compared these neuronal models to patterns of brain activity corresponding to individual faces. The data were consistent with a model where neurons respond to directions in a high-dimensional space of faces. It also proved essential to model how functional MRI voxels locally average the responses of tens of thousands of neurons. The study highlights the challenges in adjudicating between alternative computational theories of visual information processing."
10.1101/029538,"One of the central challenges in cancer research is identifying significant genes among thousands of others on a microarray. Since preventing outbreak and progression of cancer is the ultimate goal in bioinformatics and computational biology, detection of genes that are most involved is vital and crucial. In this article, we propose a Maximum-Minimum Correntropy Criterion (MMCC) approach for selection of biologically meaningful genes from microarray data sets which is stable, fast and robust against diverse noise and outliers and competitively accurate in comparison with other algorithms. Moreover, via an evolutionary optimization process, the optimal number of features for each data set is determined. Through broad experimental evaluation, MMCC is proved to be significantly better compared to other well-known gene selection algorithms for 25 commonly used microarray data sets. Surprisingly, high accuracy in classification by Support Vector Machine (SVM) is achieved by less than10 genes selected by MMCC in all of the cases."
10.1101/029546,"The distribution of mutation fitness effects is central to evolutionary genetics. Typical univariate distributions, however, cannot model the effects of multiple mutations at the same site, so we introduce a model in which mutations at the same site have correlated fitness effects. To infer the strength of that correlation, we developed a diffusion approximation to the triallelic frequency spectrum, which we applied to data from D. melanogaster. We found a moderate correlation between the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations at the same codon, suggesting that both mutation identity and location are important for determining fitness effects in proteins. We validated our approach by comparing with biochemical mutational scanning experiments, finding strong quantitative agreement, even between different organisms. We also found that the correlation of mutation fitness effects was not affected by protein solvent exposure or structural disorder. Together, our results suggest that the correlation of fitness effects at the same site is a previously overlooked yet fundamental property of protein evolution."

Here we show that solar panels in a Mediterranean city (Valencia, Spain) harbor a highly diverse microbial community with more than 500 different species per panel, most of which belong to drought-, heat- and radiation-adapted bacterial genera, and sun-irradiation adapted epiphytic fungi. The taxonomic and functional profiles of this microbial community and the characterization of selected culturable bacteria reveal the existence of a diverse mesophilic microbial community on the panels surface. This biocenosis proved to be more similar to the ones inhabiting deserts than to any human or urban microbial ecosystem.

At cytoplasmic pH, they resemble coiled ribbons of protein 500nm in diameter. At low pH, they extend to form hollow needles up to 20 microns long. They can be expressed heterologously from an operon containing four short open reading frames and can function in vitro in diverse buffer conditions.\n\nIn this study, R bodies purified from Escherichia coli were found to be capable of undergoing many consecutive extension-contraction cycles. Furthermore, the solubility of R bodies, which can easily be interpreted by eye, was found to correlate with their extension state. This macroscopic phenotype was used to develop a quantitative, high-throughput assay for R body state, enabling a visual screen of R body mutants defective in extension. The role of specific amino acids in extension was determined, and this information was used to construct rationally-designed mutants tailored to extend at higher pH. Furthermore, R bodies were able to rupture E. coli spheroplasts to release soluble proteins across lipid bilayers. Taken together, these results show that R bodies act as tunable, pH-actuated pistons suitable for a variety of membrane-breaking applications."

We describe here an improved method that makes novel use of the co-citation network of each article to field-normalize the number of citations it has received.

10.1101/029702,"The male specific regions of primate Y-chromosomes (MSY) are enriched for multi-copy genes highly expressed in the testis. These genes are located in large repetitive sequences arranged as palindromes, inverted-, and tandem-repeats termed amplicons. In humans, these genes have critical roles in male fertility and are essential for the production of sperm. The structure of human and chimpanzee amplicon sequences show remarkable difference relative to the remainder of the genome, a difference that may be the result of intense selective pressure on male fertility. Four populations of common chimpanzees have undergone extended periods of isolation and appear to be in the early process of speciation. A recent study found amplicons enriched for testis-expressed genes on the primate X-chromosome the target of hard selective sweeps, and male-fertility genes on the Y-chromosome may also be the targets of selection. However, little is understood about Y-chromosome amplicon diversity within and across chimpanzee populations. Here, we analyze 9 common chimpanzee (representing three subspecies: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan troglodytes ellioti, and Pan troglodytes verus) and two bonobo (Pan paniscus) male whole-genome sequences to assess Y ampliconic copy-number diversity across the Pan genus. We observe that the copy-number of Y chromosome amplicons is variable amongst chimpanzees and bonobos, and identify several lineage-specific patterns, including variable copy-number of azoospermia candidates RBMY and DAZ. We detect recurrent switchpoints of copy-number change along the ampliconic tracts across chimpanzee populations, which may be the result of localized genome instability or selective forces."
10.1101/029652,"Motivation: The alignment of sequencing reads to a transcriptome is a common and important step in many RNA-seq analysis tasks. When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis.\n\nResults: We introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap-- our tool implementing quasi-mapping-- is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we employ to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information. We demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level quantification from RNA-seq reads and the clustering of contigs from de novo assembled transcriptomes into biologically-meaningful groups.\n\nAvailability: RapMap is implemented in C++11 and is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap.\n\nContact: rob.patro@cs.stonybrook.edu"

10.1101/029645,"DNA-binding proteins control many fundamental biological processes such as transcription, recombination and replication. A major goal is to decipher the role that DNA sequence plays in orchestrating the binding and activity of such regulatory proteins. To address this goal, it is useful to rationally design DNA sequences with desired numbers, affinities and arrangements of protein binding sites. However, removing binding sites from DNA is computationally non-trivial since one risks creating new sites in the process of deleting or moving others. Here we present an online binding site removal tool, SiteOut, that enables users to design arbitrary DNA sequences that entirely lack binding sites for factors of interest. SiteOut can also be used to delete sites from a specific sequence, or to introduce site-free spacers between functional sequences without creating new sites at the junctions. In combination with commercial DNA synthesis services, SiteOut provides a powerful and flexible platform for synthetic projects that interrogate regulatory DNA. Here we describe the algorithm and illustrate the ways in which SiteOut can be used; it is publicly available at https://depace.med.harvard.edu/siteout/."
10.1101/029769,"One of the most important needs in the post-genome era is providing the researchers with reliable and efficient computational tools to extract and analyze this huge amount of biological data, in which DNA copy number variation (CNV) is a vitally important one. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a common approach in order to detect CNVs. Most of methods for this purpose were proposed for one-dimensional profile. However, slightly this focus has moved from one- to multi-dimensional signals. In addition, since contamination of these profiles with noise is always an issue, it is highly important to have a robust method for analyzing multi-sample aCGH data. In this paper, we propose Robust Grouped Fused Lasso (RGFL) which utilizes the Robust Group Total Variations (RGTV). Instead of l2,1 norm, the l1-l2 M-estimator is used which is more robust in dealing with non-Gaussian noise and high corruption. More importantly, Correntropy (Welsch M-estimator) is also applied for fitting error.

Looming has been proposed as the main monocular visual cue for detecting the approach of other animals and avoiding collisions with stationary obstacles. Elegant neural mechanisms for looming detection have been found in the brain of insects and vertebrates. However, looming has not been analyzed in the context of collisions between two moving animals. We propose an alternative strategy, generalized regressive motion (GRM), which is consistent with recently observed behavior in fruit flies. Geometric analysis proves that GRM is a reliable cue to collision among conspecifics, whereas agent-based modeling suggests that GRM is a better cue than looming as a means to detect approach, prevent collisions and maintain mobility."

We also compared the results of digital analysis with standard visual estimation. Percentages of p53 positive cells were higher by visual estimation than by digital analysis. However, correlation was high between both methods. Our study shows that evaluation of p53 immunohistochemical expression is feasible using open-source software packages for digital image analysis. Although our analysis was limited to penile SCC, the rationale should also hold for other tumor types in which evaluation of p53 immunohistochemical expression is required.

10.1101/029843,"Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of genome sequencing. This development has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed, and communicated. To facilitate this effort, compression of genomic files has been proposed. Specifically, lossy compression of quality scores is emerging as a natural candidate for reducing the growing costs of storage. A main goal of performing DNA sequencing in population studies and clinical settings is to identify genetic variation. Though the field agrees that smaller files are advantageous, the cost of lossy compression, in terms of variant discovery, is unclear.\n\nBioinformatic algorithms to identify SNPs and INDELs from next-generation DNA sequencing data use base quality score information; here, we evaluate the effect of lossy compression of quality scores on SNP and INDEL detection. We analyze several lossy compressors introduced recently in the literature. Specifically, we investigate how the output of the variant caller when using the original data (uncompressed) differs from that obtained when quality scores are replaced by those generated by a lossy compressor. Using gold standard genomic datasets such as the GIAB (Genome In A Bottle) consensus sequence for NA12878 and simulated data, we are able to analyze how accurate the output of the variant calling is, both for the original data and that previously lossily compressed. We show that lossy compression can significantly alleviate the storage while maintaining variant calling performance comparable to that with the uncompressed data. Further, in some cases lossy compression can lead to variant calling performance which is superior to that using the uncompressed file. We envisage our findings and framework serving as a benchmark in future development and analyses of lossy genomic data compressors.\n\nThe Supplementary Data can be found at http://web.stanford.edu/~iochoa/supplementEffectLossy.zip."

Here, we use a full genome sequenced population of 7396 yeast strains of varying relatedness, and predict growth traits from family information, effects of segregating genetic variants, and growth measurements in other environments with an average coefficient of determination R2 of 0.91. This accuracy exceeds narrow-sense heritability, approaches limits imposed by measurement repeatability, and is higher than achieved with a single replicate assay in the lab. We find that both relatedness and variant-based predictions are greatly aided by availability of closer relatives, while information from a large number of more distant relatives does not improve predictive performance when close relatives can be used. Our results prove that very accurate prediction of heritable traits is possible, and recommend prioritizing collection of deeper family-based data over large reference cohorts."
10.1101/029595,"Intratumoural heterogeneity is known to contribute to poor therapeutic response. Variations in oxygen tension in particular have been correlated with changes in radiation response in vitro and at the clinical scale with overall survival. Heterogeneity at the microscopic scale in tumour blood vessel architecture has been described, and is one source of the underlying variations in oxygen tension. We endeavour to determine whether histologic scale measures of the erratic distribution of blood vessels within a tumour can be used to predict differing radiation response. Using a two-dimensional hybrid cellular automaton model of tumour growth, we evaluate the effect of vessel distribution on cell survival outcomes of simulated radiation therapy. Using the standard equations for the oxygen enhancement ratio for cell survival probability under differing oxygen tensions, we calculate average radiation effect over a range of different vessel densities and organisations. We go on to quantify the vessel distribution heterogeneity and measure spatial organization using Ripleys L function, a measure designed to detect deviations from spatial homogeneity. We find that under differing regimes of vessel density the correlation coefficient between the measure of spatial organization and radiation effect changes sign. This provides not only a useful way to understand the differences seen in radiation effect for tissues based on vessel architecture, but also an alternate explanation for the vessel normalization hypothesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this paper we use a mathematical model, called a hybrid cellular automaton, to study the effect of different vessel distributions on radiation therapy outcomes at the cellular level. We show that the correlation between radiation outcome and spatial organization of vessels changes signs between relatively low and high vessel density. Specifically, that for relatively low vessel density, radiation efficacy is decreased when vessels are more homogeneously distributed, and the opposite is true, that radiation efficacy is improved, when vessel organisation is normalised in high densities. This result suggests an alteration to the vessel normalization hypothesis which states that normalisation of vascular beds should improve radio- and chemo-therapeutic response, but has failed to be validated in clinical studies. In this alteration, we provide a metric that differentiates between vascular architectures in different density regimes in which the hypothesis holds and does not and that could be used for quantitative histologic analysis of tumours, and for radiation dose personalisation.\n\nAuthor ContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: JGS, AGF, ARAA, PKM\n\nPerformed the experiments: JGS\n\nAnalyzed the data: JGS, AGF, ARAA, PKM\n\nWrote the paper: JGS, AGF, ARAA, PKM"
10.1101/029918,"Recent experiments evolving de novo multicellularity in yeast have found that large-cluster forming genotypes also exhibit higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis). This was previously interpreted as the evolution of a simple form of cellular division of labor: apoptosis results in the scission of cell-cell connections, allowing snowflake yeast to produce proportionally smaller, faster-growing propagules. Through spatial simulations, Duran-Nebreda and Sole (2015) develop the novel null hypothesis that apoptosis is not an adaptation, per se, but is instead caused by the accumulation of toxic metabolites in large clusters. Here we test this hypothesis by synthetically creating unicellular derivatives of snowflake yeast through functional complementation with the ancestral ACE2 allele. We find that multicellular snowflake yeast with elevated apoptosis exhibit a similar rate of apoptosis when cultured as single cells. We also show that larger snowflake yeast clusters tend to contain a greater fraction of older, senescent cells, which may explain why larger clusters of a given genotype are more apoptotic. Our results show that apoptosis is not caused by side effects of spatial structure, such as starvation or waste product accumulation, and are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated apoptosis is a trait which co-evolves with large cluster size."
10.1101/029926,"Plasmids are central contributors to microbial evolution and genome innovation. Recently, they have been found to have important roles in antibiotic resistance and in affecting production of metabolites used in industrial and agricultural applications. However, their characterization through deep sequencing remains challenging, in spite of rapid drops in cost and throughput increases for sequencing. Here, we attempt to ameliorate this situation by introducing a new plasmid-specific assembly algorithm, leveraging assembly graphs provided by a conventional de novo assembler and alignments of paired- end reads to assembled graph nodes. We introduce the first tool for this task, called Recycler, and demonstrate its merits in comparison with extant approaches. We show that Recycler greatly increases the number of true plasmids recovered while remaining highly accurate. On simulated plasmidomes, Recycler recovered 5-14% more true plasmids compared to the best extant method with overall precision of about 90%. We validated these results in silico on real data, as well as in vitro by PCR validation performed on a subset of Recyclers predictions on different data types. All 12 of Recyclers outputs on isolate samples matched known plasmids or phages, and had alignments having at least 97% identity over at least 99% of the reported reference sequence lengths. For the two E. Coli strains examined, most known plasmid sequences were recovered, while in both cases additional plasmids only known to be present in different hosts were found. Recycler also generated plasmids in high agreement with known annotation on real plasmidome data. Moreover, in PCR validations performed on 77 sequences, Recycler showed mean accuracy of 89% across all data types - isolate, microbiome, and plasmidome. Recycler is available at http://github.com/Shamir-Lab/Recycler"
10.1101/029934,"Halite endoliths in the Atacama Desert represent one of the most extreme microbial ecosystems on Earth. Here we sequenced and characterized a shotgun metagenome from halite nodules collected in Salar Grande, Chile. The community is dominated by archaea and functional analysis attributed most of the autotrophic CO2 fixation to a unique cyanobacterium. The assembled 1.1 Mbp genome of a novel nanohaloarchaeon, Candidatus Nanopetramus SG9, revealed a photoheterotrophic life style and a low median isoelectric point (pI) for all predicted proteins, suggesting a \""salt-in\"" strategy for osmotic balance. Predicted proteins of the algae identified in the community also had pI distributions similar to \""salt-in\"" strategists. The Nanopetramus genome contained a unique CRISPR/Cas system with a spacer that matched a partial viral genome from the metagenome. A combination of reference-independent methods identified over 30 complete or near complete viral or proviral genomes with diverse genome structure, genome size, gene content, and hosts. Putative hosts included Halobacteriaceae, Nanohaloarchaea, and Cyanobacteria. Despite the dependence of the halite community on deliquescence for liquid water availability, this study exposed an ecosystem spanning three phylogenetic domains, containing a large diversity of viruses, and a predominant \""salt-in\"" strategy to balance the high osmotic pressure of the environment."
10.1101/029942,"The extent to which selection and demography impact patterns of genetic diversity in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster is yet to be fully understood. We previously observed that the pattern of LD at scales of ~10 kb in the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), consisting of 145 inbred strains from Raleigh, North Carolina, measured both between pairs of sites and as haplotype homozygosity, is elevated above neutral demographic expectations. Further, we demonstrated that signatures of strong and recent soft sweeps are abundant. However, the extent to which this pattern is specific to this derived and admixed population is unknown. Neither is it clear whether such a pattern may have arisen as a consequence of the extensive inbreeding performed to generate the DGRP data. Here we analyze > 100 fully sequenced strains from Zambia, an ancestral population to the Raleigh population, that has experienced little to no admixture and was generated by sequencing haploid embryos rather than inbred strains. This data set allows us to determine whether patterns of elevated LD and signatures of abundant soft sweeps are generic to multiple populations of D. melanogaster or whether they are generated either by inbreeding, bottlenecks or admixture in the DGRP dataset. We find an elevation in long-range LD and haplotype homozygosity in the Zambian dataset, confirming the result from the DGRP data set. This elevation in LD and haplotype structure remains even after controlling for many sources of LD in the data including genomic inversions, admixture, population substructure, close relatedness of individual strains, and recombination rate variation. Furthermore, signatures of partial soft sweeps similar to those found in the DGRP are common in Zambia. These results suggest that while the selective forces and sources of adaptive mutations may differ in Zambia and Raleigh, elevated long-range LD and signatures of soft sweeps are generic in D. melanogaster."
10.1101/029900,"Across a species range, islands of stressful habitats impose similar selection pressures on isolated populations. It is as yet unclear, when populations respond to these selective pressures, the extent to which this results in convergent genetic evolution and whether convergence is due to independent mutations or shared ancestral variation. We address these questions investigating a classic example of adaptation by natural selection - the colonization of plant species to heavy metal contaminated soils. We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance QTL, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment, but are neutral, or nearly so, in the off-mine environment. To identify scaffolds in genetic linkage with this locus, we assemble the genome of a mine adapted M. guttatus genotype and sequence near isogenic lines (NILs) homozygous for tolerant or non-tolerant alleles at Tol1. We identify genes with differential expression between NILs and differences in allele frequency between independent pairs of mine and off-mine populations to identify Tol1 candidate genes. We identify a single gene, a multicopper oxidase, with large differences in expression between NILs and allele frequency between populations. Furthermore, we find patterns of genetic variation at Tol1, and four additional candidate adaptation loci, are consistent with selection acting upon beneficial haplotypes that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. We estimate the age of selected Tol1 haplotype to be at least 1700 years old and was at a frequency of 0.4-0.6% in the ancestral population when mining was initiated 150 years ago. These results suggest that adaptation to the mine habitat routinely occurs via selection on ancestral variation, rather than independent de-novo mutations or migration between populations."
10.1101/029975,"Thousands of candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) have been identified, supporting the idea that unique to human phenotypes result from human-specific alterations of genomic regulatory networks. Here, conservation patterns analysis of 18,364 regulatory DNA segments comprising candidate HSRS was carried out using the most recent releases of the reference genomes databases of humans and nonhuman primates (NHP) and defining the sequence conservation threshold as the minimum ratio of bases that must remap of 1.00. Present analyses identified 5,535 candidate HSRS defined by either the acceleration of mutation rates on the human lineage or the functional divergence from chimpanzee that are highly conserved in NHP and appear to evolve by the exaptation of ancestral DNA pathway. This pathway seems mechanistically distinct from the evolution of regulatory DNA driven by the species-specific expansion of transposable elements. It is proposed that phenotypic divergence of Homo sapiens is driven by the evolution of human-specific genomic regulatory networks via at least two mechanistically distinct pathways of creation of divergent sequences of regulatory DNA: i) exaptation of the highly conserved ancestral regulatory DNA segments; ii) human-specific insertions of transposable elements."
10.1101/029967,"Single-cell bacterial sensors have numerous applications in human health monitoring, environmental chemical detection, and materials biosynthesis. Such bacterial devices need not only the capability to differentiate between combinations of inputs, but also the ability to process signal timing and duration. In this work, we present a two-input temporal logic gate that can sense and record the order of the inputs, the timing between inputs, and the duration of input pulses. The temporal logic gate design relies on unidirectional DNA recombination with bacteriophage integrases to detect and encode sequences of input events. When implemented in a chromosomally-modified E. coli strain, we can utilize stochastic single cell responses to predict overall heterogeneous population behavior. We show that a stochastic model can be used to predict final population distributions of this E. coli strain, and thus that final differentiated sub-populations can be used to deduce the timing and duration of transient chemical events."
10.1101/030015,"Defoliation outbreaks are biological disturbances that alter tree growth and mortality in temperate forests. Trees respond to defoliation in many ways; some recover rapidly, while others decline gradually or die. These differences may arise from species functional traits that constrain growth such as xylem anatomy, growth phenology or non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage, but this has not been shown. Although many studies address these phenomena, varied and idiosyncratic measures limit our ability to generalize and predict defoliation responses across species. I synthesized and translated published growth and mortality data into consistent standardized variables suitable for numerical models. I analyzed data from 32 studies, including 16 tree species and 10 defoliator systems from North America and Eurasia, and quantitatively compared responses to defoliation among species and tree functional groups using linear mixed-effects models.\n\nRelative growth decreased linearly or curvilinearly as defoliation stress accumulated across species. Growth decreased by only 5-20% following 100% defoliation in ring-porous Quercus, whereas growth of diffuse-porous hardwoods and conifers declined by 50-100%. Mortality increased exponentially with defoliation, more rapidly for Pinus and diffuse-porous species than for Quercus and Abies. Species-specific mixed models were best (R2c = 0.83-0.94), yet functional-group models lost little in terms of goodness-of-fit (R2c = 0.72-0.92), providing useful alternatives when species data is lacking. These responses are consistent with functional differences in wood growth phenology and NSC storage. Ring-porous spring xylem growth precedes budburst. Defoliators whose damage follows foliar development can only affect development of later wood. Growth of diffuse-porous and coniferous species responds more drastically, yet differences in NSC storage make them more vulnerable to mortality as stress accumulates. Ring-porous species resist defoliation-related changes in growth and mortality more than diffuse-porous and coniferous species. These findings apply in general to disturbances that cause spring defoliation and should be incorporated into forest vegetation models."
10.1101/030031,"Annual and summertime trends towards increasingly variable values of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) over a sub-decadal period (five years) were investigated within the contiguous United States between 1895 and the present. For the contiguous U.S. as a whole, there is a significant increasing trend in the five-year running minimum-maximum ranges for the annual PDSI (aPDSI5yr(min| max range)). During this time frame, the average aPDSI5yr(min|max range) has increased by about one full unit, indicating a substantial increase is drought variability over short time scales across the United States. The end members of the running aPDSI5yr(min|max range) highlight even more rapid changes in the drought index variability within the past 120 years. This increasing variability in the aPDSI5yr(min|max range) is driven primarily by changes taking place in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean coastal climate regions, climate regions which collectively comprise one-third the area of the contiguous U.S. Overall, interannual drought patterns are becoming more extreme and difficult to predict, posing a challenge to agricultural and other water-resource related planning efforts."
10.1101/028860,"Although diet is believed to be a major factor underlying the evolution of venom, few comparative studies examine both venom composition and diet across a radiation of venomous species. Cone snails within the family, Conidae, comprise more than 700 species of carnivorous marine snails that capture their prey by using a cocktail of venomous neurotoxins (conotoxins or conopeptides). Venom composition across species has been previously hypothesized to be shaped by (a) prey taxonomic class (i.e., worms, molluscs, or fish) and (b) dietary breadth. We tested these hypotheses under a comparative phylogenetic framework using ecological data in conjunction with venom duct transcriptomes sequenced from 12 phylogenetically disparate cone snail species, including 10 vermivores (worm-eating), one molluscivore, and one generalist. We discovered 2223 unique conotoxin precursor peptides that encoded 1864 unique mature toxins across all species, >90% of which are new to this study. In addition, we identified two novel gene superfamilies and 16 novel cysteine frameworks. Each species exhibited unique venom profiles, with venom composition and expression patterns among species dominated by a restricted set of gene superfamilies and mature toxins. In contrast with the dominant paradigm for interpreting Conidae venom evolution, prey taxonomic class did not predict venom composition patterns among species. Our results suggests that cone snails have either evolved species-specific expression patterns likely as a consequence of the rapid evolution of conotoxin genes, or that traditional means of categorizing prey type (i.e., worms, mollusc, or fish) and conotoxins (i.e., by gene superfamily) do not accurately encapsulate evolutionary dynamics between diet and venom composition. We also found a significant positive relationship between dietary breadth and measures of conotoxin complexity. These results indicate that species with more generalized diets tend to have more complex venoms and utilize a greater number of venom genes for prey capture. Whether this increased gene diversity confers an increased capacity for evolutionary change remains to be tested. Overall, our results corroborate the key role of diet in influencing patterns of venom evolution in cone snails and other venomous radiations."
10.1101/030049,"The quantitative prediction of transcriptional activity of genes using promoter sequence is fundamental to the engineering of biological systems for industrial purposes and understanding the natural variation in gene expression. To catalyze the development of new algorithms for this purpose, the Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods (DREAM) organized a community challenge seeking predictive models of promoter activity given normalized promoter activity data for 90 ribosomal protein promoters driving expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. By developing an unbiased modeling approach that performs an iterative search for predictive DNA sequence features using the frequencies of various k-mers, inferred DNA mechanical properties and spatial positions of promoter sequences, we achieved the best performer status in this challenge. The specific predictive features used in the model included the frequency of the nucleotide G, the length of polymeric tracts of T and TA, the frequencies of 6 distinct trinucleotides and 12 tetranucleotides, and the predicted protein deformability of the DNA sequence. Our method accurately predicted the activity of 20 natural variants of ribosomal protein promoters (Spearman correlation r = 0.73) as compared to 33 laboratory-mutated variants of the promoters (r = 0.57) in a test set that was hidden from participants. Notably, our model differed substantially from the rest in 2 main ways: i) it did not explicitly utilize transcription factor binding information implying that subtle DNA sequence features are highly associated with gene expression, and ii) it was entirely based on features extracted exclusively from the 100 bp region upstream from the translational start site demonstrating that this region encodes much of the overall promoter activity. The findings from this study have important implications for the engineering of predictable gene expression systems and the evolution of gene expression in naturally occurring biological systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryGene expression is the first step at which information encoded in DNA is transcribed into RNA. Predicting gene expression from DNA sequence can provide insights into the natural variation of gene expression underlying various phenotypes and direct the engineering of genes of desired activity, for example in industrial processes. While several studies show that gene expression is influenced by DNA sequence. its quantitative prediction from DNA sequence alone remains a challenging problem. Unfortunately, studies aimed at developing quantitative models for gene expression prediction are not directly comparable because most have used distinct data sets for training and evaluation. and many of the methods have not been independently verified. Open innovation challenges in which a problem is posed to a wide community provide a framework for independent verification of the performance of various computational methods using the same benchmark data sets and statistical procedures. Here. we describe the best performing computational model amongst those of 20 other teams in the DREAM6 Gene Expression Prediction challenge. We show that a highly predictive gene expression model can be obtained by an unbiased. data-driven approach that makes little assumption on the role of known mechanisms for gene regulation."

Extracts that presented higher antimalarial activity potential were gorgonian Callogorgia verticillata and the hydrothermal vent shrimp Mirocaris fortunata, presenting the lowest value of IC50 and the highest selectivity index for both evaluated stains. To our knowledge this is the first report on the antimalarial activity of crude lipid extracts considering species collected at depths higher then 100 m."
10.1101/029991,"Human microbiota plays an important role in determining changes from health to disease. Increasing research activity is dedicated to understand its diversity and variability. We analyse 16S rRNA and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from the gut microbiota of 97 individuals monitored in time. Temporal fluctuations in the microbiome reveal significant differences due to factors that affect the microbiota such as dietary changes, antibiotic intake, early gut development or disease. Here we show that a fluctuation scaling law describes the temporal variability of the system and that a noise-induced phase transition is central in the route to disease. The universal law distinguishes healthy from sick microbiota and quantitatively characterizes the path in the phase space, which opens up its potential clinical use and, more generally, other technological applications where microbiota plays an important role.\n\nPACS numbers:"
10.1101/030072,"Here, we describe the implementation of three techniques for capturing and killing Staphylococcus aureus in blood in vitro inside a medical tube. The first technique involves capturing and removing pathogens using antibodies that are coated, via a simple chemical process, on the inner walls of a modified medical tube (tube capturing technique). In the second technique, a photosensitizer-antibody conjugate adheres to the pathogens while in circulation. When blood flows through the same kind of tube, the conjugate is activated by near-infrared (NIR) light to kill pathogens (photodynamic therapy technique). For the third technique, pathogens are exposed to light in the ultraviolet (UV) range while circulating through a similar tube (UV technique), which kills the pathogens. We spiked blood with S. aureus, starting with about 107 CFU/mL and ending at 108 CFU/mL after 5 hours. While the spiked bacteria rapidly grew in nutrition-rich whole blood, each of the three techniques were able to independently remove between 61% and 84% more S. aureus in the experimental blood sample compared to the controls groups. When combined, these techniques demonstrated a removal rate between 87% and 92%."
10.1101/030056,"Ancient origins, profound ecological divergence and extensive hybridization make the fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata (Anura: Bombinatoridae) an intriguing test case of ecological speciation. Narrow Bombina hybrid zones erect barriers to neutral introgression whose strength has been estimated previously. We test this prediction by inferring the rate of gene exchange between pure populations on either side of the intensively studied Krakow transect. We developed a software pipeline to extract high confidence sets of orthologous genes from de novo transcriptome assemblies, fitted a range of divergence models to these data and assessed their relative support with analytic likelihoods calculations. There was clear evidence for post-divergence gene flow, but, as expected, no perceptible signal of recent introgression via the nearby hybrid zone. The analysis of two additional Bombina taxa (B. v. scabra and B. orientalis) validated our parameter estimates against a larger set of prior expectations. Despite substantial cumulative introgression over millions of years, adaptive divergence of the hybridizing taxa is essentially unaffected by their lack of reproductive isolation. Extended distribution ranges also buffer them against small-scale environmental perturbations that have been shown to reverse the speciation process in other, more recent ecotypes."
10.1101/030080,"Key Message Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform radiata pine shoots and to efficiently produce stable genetically modified pine plants.\n\nAbstract Micropropagated shoot explants from Pinus radiata D. Don were used to produce stable transgenic plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using this method any genotype that can be micropropagated could produce stable transgenic lines. As over 80% of P. radiata genotypes tested can be micropropagated, this effectively means that any line chosen for superior characteristics could be transformed. There are well-established protocols for progressing such germplasm to field deployment. Here we used open and control pollinated seed lines and embryogenic clones. The method developed was faster than other methods previously developed using mature cotyledons. PCR positive shoots could be obtain within 6 months of Agrobacterium co-cultivation compared with 12 months for cotyledon methods. Transformed shoots were obtained using either kanamycin or geneticin as the selectable marker gene. Shoots were recovered from selection, were tested and were not chimeric, indicating that the selection pressure was optimal for this explant type. GFP was used as a vital marker, and the bar gene, (for resistance to the herbicide Buster(R)) was used to produce lines that could potentially be used in commercial application. As expected, a range of expression phenotypes were identified for both these reporter genes and the analyses for expression were relatively easy."
10.1101/030122,"Flowers face desiccating conditions, yet little is known about their ability to transport water. We quantified variability in floral hydraulic conductance (Kflower) for 20 species from 10 families and related it to traits hypothesized to be associated with liquid and vapor phase water transport. Basal angiosperm flowers had trait values associated with higher water and carbon costs than monocot and eudicot flowers. Kflower was coordinated with water supply (vein length per area, VLA) and loss (minimum epidermal conductance, gmin) traits among the magnoliids, but was insensitive to variation in these traits among the monocots and eudicots. Phylogenetic independent contrast (PIC) correlations revealed that few traits had undergone coordinated evolution. However, VLA and the desiccation time (Tdes), the quotient of water content and gmin, had significant trait and PIC correlations. The near absence of stomata from monocot and eudicot flowers may have been critical in minimizing water loss rates among these clades. Early-divergent, basal angiosperm flowers maintain higher Kflower due to traits associated with high rates water loss and water supply, while monocot and eudicot flowers employ a more conservative strategy of limiting water loss and may rely on stored water to maintain turgor and delay desiccation."
10.1101/029983,"BackgroundMobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers - some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) and an iPhone with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program - making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management.\n\nResults & ConclusionsThere was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.\n\nDisclosure of FundingThis research is funded in part by a NIH/NCATS flagship Clinical and Translational Science Award Grant (1UL1 TR001114), Qualcomm Foundation Scripps Health Digital Medicine Research Grant, and Scripps Healths Division of Innovation and Human Capital and Division of Scripps Genomic Medicine.

10.1101/030205,"The mitochondrial (mt) genome is present in many copies in human cells, and intra-individual variation in mtDNA sequences is known as heteroplasmy. Recent studies found that heteroplasmies are highly tissue-specific, site-specific, and allele-specific, however the functional implications have not been explored. This study investigates variation in mtDNA copy numbers (mtCN) in 12 different tissues obtained at autopsy from 152 individuals (ranging in age from 3 days to 96 years). Three different methods to estimate mtCN were compared: shotgun sequencing (in 4 tissues), capture-enriched sequencing (in 12 tissues) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, in 2 tissues). The highest precision in mtCN estimation was achieved using shotgun sequencing data. However, capture-enrichment data provide reliable estimates of relative (albeit not absolute) mtCNs. Comparisons of mtCN from different tissues of the same individual revealed that mtCNs in different tissues are, with few exceptions, uncorrelated. Hence, each tissue of an individual seems to regulate mtCN in a tissue-related rather than an individual-dependent manner. Skeletal muscle (SM) samples showed an age-related decrease in mtCN that was especially pronounced in males, while there was an age-related increase in mtCN for liver (LIV) samples. MtCN in SM samples was significantly negatively correlated with both the total number of heteroplasmic sites and with minor allele frequency (MAF) at two heteroplasmic sites, 408 and 16327. Heteroplasmies at both sites are highly specific for SM, accumulate with aging and are part of functional elements that regulate mtDNA replication. These data support the hypothesis that selection acting on these heteroplasmic sites is reducing mtCN in SM of older individuals.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe total number of mitochondrial genomes in a human cell differs between individuals and between the tissues of a single individual; however the factors that influence this variation remain unknown. We estimated mtDNA copy number (mtCN) in 12 different tissues of 152 individuals applying three different methods, and found age-related variation for two tissues: mtCN in skeletal muscle is negatively correlated with age (especially in males) while mtCN in liver is positively correlated with age. Overall, mtCNs of different tissues within an individual are mainly independent of each other, indicating that tissue-specific rather than individual-specific processes largely influence mtCN.\n\nHeteroplasmy refers to intra-individual differences in the sequence of the mtDNA genome and heteroplasmic mutations accumulate during aging. Linear and partial regression analyses of mtCN with heteroplasmy (determined in a previous study of these same samples) revealed that the decrease of mtCN in skeletal muscle is mainly correlated with an increasing total number of heteroplasmic sites, and with increasing minor allele frequency at two sites (408 and 16327), that are heteroplasmic almost exclusively in skeletal muscle. As both sites are part of functional elements required for regulation of mtDNA replication, we suggest that selection may be acting via increasing heteroplasmy to reduce mtCN during aging."
10.1101/030189,"There is a growing interest in developing novel brain stimulation methods to control disease-related aberrant neural activity and to address basic neuroscience questions. Conventional methods for manipulating brain activity rely on open-loop approaches that usually lead to excessive stimulation and, crucially, do not restore the original computations performed by the network. Thus, they are often accompanied by undesired side-effects. Here, we introduce delayed feedback control (DFC), a conceptually simple but effective method, to control pathological oscillations in spiking neural networks. Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations we show that DFC can restore a wide range of aberrant network dynamics either by suppressing or enhancing synchronous irregular activity. Importantly, DFC besides steering the system back to a healthy state, it also recovers the computations performed by the underlying network. Finally, using our theory we isolate the role of single neuron and synapse properties in determining the stability of the closed-loop system."
10.1101/030155,"BackgroundGene expression is known to be an intrinsically stochastic process which can involve single-digit numbers of mRNA molecules in a cell at any given time. The modelling of such processes calls for the use of exact stochastic simulation methods, most notably the Gillespie algorithm. However, this stochasticity, also termed \""intrinsic noise\"", does not account for all the variability between genetically identical cells growing in a homogeneous environment. Despite substantial experimental efforts, determining appropriate model parameters continues to be a challenge. Methods based on approximate Bayesian computation can be used to obtain posterior parameter distributions given the observed data. However, such inference procedures require large numbers of simulations of the model and exact stochastic simulation is computationally costly. In this work we focus on the specific case of trying to infer model parameters describing reaction rates and extrinsic noise on the basis of measurements of molecule numbers in individual cells at a given time point.\n\nResultsTo make the problem computationally tractable we develop an exact, model-specific, stochastic simulation algorithm for the commonly used two-state model of gene expression. This algorithm relies on certain assumptions and favourable properties of the model to forgo the simulation of the whole temporal trajectory of protein numbers in the system, instead returning only the number of protein and mRNA molecules present in the system at a specified time point. The computational gain is proportional to the number of protein molecules created in the system and becomes significant for systems involving hundreds or thousands of protein molecules. We employ this algorithm, approximate Bayesian computation, and published gene expression data for Escherichia coli to simultaneously infer the models rate parameters and parameters describing extrinsic noise for 86 genes."

This new approach has several advantages over state of the art approaches currently popular for data analysis: experts can design simplified data analysis languages that require no programming experience, and behave like graphical user interfaces, yet have the advantages of scripting. We report on such a simple language, called MetaR, which we have used to teach complete beginners how to call differentially expressed genes and build heatmaps. We found that beginners can complete this task in less than 2 hours with MetaR, when more traditional teaching with R and its packages would require several training sessions (6-24hrs). Furthermore, MetaR seamlessly integrates with docker to enable reproducibility of analyses and simplified R package installations during training sessions. We used the same approach to develop the first composable R language. A composable language is a language that can be extended with micro-languages. We illustrate this capability with a Biomart micro-language designed to compose with R and help R programmers query Biomart interactively to assemble specific queries to retrieve data, (The same micro-language also composes with MetaR to help beginners query Biomart.) Our teaching experience suggests that language design with LWT can be a compelling approach for developing intelligent data analysis tools and can accelerate training for common data analysis task. LWT offers an interactive environment with the potential to promote exchanges between beginner and expert data analysts."
10.1101/030163,"The Chlamydomonas genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to produce a rich resource for genetics and molecular biology in this well-studied model organism. However, the current reference genome contains ~1000 blocks of unknown sequence ( N-islands), which are frequently placed in introns of annotated gene models. We developed a strategy, using careful bioinformatics analysis of short-sequence cDNA and genomic DNA reads, to search for previously unknown exons hidden within such blocks, and determine the sequence and exon/intron boundaries of such exons. These methods are based on assembly and alignment completely independent of prior reference assembly or reference annotation. Our evidence indicates that ~one-quarter of the annotated intronic N-islands actually contain hidden exons. For most of these our algorithm recovers full exonic sequence with associated splice junctions and exon-adjacent intron sequence, that can be joined to the reference genome assembly and annotated transcript models. These new exons represent de novo sequence generally present nowhere in the assembled genome, and the added sequence can be shown in many cases to greatly improve evolutionary conservation of the predicted encoded peptides. At the same time, our results confirm the purely intronic status for a substantial majority of N-islands annotated as intronic in the reference annotated genome, increasing confidence in this valuable resource."
10.1101/030221,"Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are required for the development and differentiation of T cells and are sufficient for the positive and negative selection of developing T cells. Although TECs play a critical role in T cell biology, simple, efficient and readily scalable methods for the transfection of TEC lines and primary TECs have not been described. We tested the efficiency of Nucleofection for the transfection of 4 different mouse thymic epithelial cell lines that had been derived from cortical or medullary epithelium. We also tested primary mouse thymic epithelial cells isolated from fetal and postnatal stages. We found that Nucleofection was highly efficient for the transfection of thymic epithelial cells, with transfection efficiencies of 30-70% for the cell lines and 15-35% for primary TECs with low amounts of cell death. Efficient transfection by Nucleofection can be performed with established cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cell lines as well as primary TECs isolated from E15.5 day fetal thymus or postnatal day 3 or 30 thymus tissue. The high efficiency of Nucleofection for TEC transfection will enable the use of TEC lines in high throughput transfection studies and simplifies the transfection of primary TECs for in vitro or in vivo analysis."
10.1101/030270,"Genetic studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have established that de novo duplications and deletions contribute to risk. However, ascertainment of structural variation (SV) has been restricted by the coarse resolution of current approaches. By applying a custom pipeline for SV discovery, genotyping and de novo assembly to genome sequencing of 235 subjects, 71 cases, 26 sibling controls and their parents, we present an atlas of 1.2 million SVs (5,213/genome), comprising 11 different classes. We demonstrate a high diversity of de novo mutations, a majority of which were undetectable by previous methods. In addition, we observe complex mutation clusters where combinations of de novo SVs, nucleotide substitutions and indels occurred as a single event. We estimate a high rate of structural mutation in humans (20%). Genetic risk for ASD is attributable to an elevated frequency of gene-disrupting de novo SVs but not an elevated rate of genome rearrangement."
10.1101/030247,"Demographic, genetic, or stochastic factors can lead to perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) between alleles at two loci without respect to the extent of their physical distance, a phenomenon that Lawrence et al. (2005a) refer to as \""genetic indistinguishability\"". This phenomenon can complicate genotype-phenotype association testing by hindering the ability to localize causal alleles, but has not been thoroughly explored from a theoretical perspective or using large, dense whole-genome polymorphism datasets. We derive a simple theoretical model of the prevalence of genetic indistinguishability between unlinked loci, and verify its accuracy via simulation. We show that sample size and minor allele frequency are the major determinants of the prevalence of perfect LD between unlinked loci but that demographic factors, such as deviations from random mating, can produce significant effects as well. Finally, we quantify this phenomenon in three model organisms and find thousands of pairs of moderate-frequency (> 5%) genetically indistinguishable variants in relatively large datasets. These results clarify a previously underexplored population genetic phenomenon with important implications for association studies, and define conditions under which it is likely to manifest."
10.1101/030338,"Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ethnicities generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). The resulting catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We show that this catalogue can be used to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; we identify 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of truncating variants, 72% of which have no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human \""knockout\"" variants in protein-coding genes."
10.1101/030353,"Computer simulations are routinely conducted to evaluate new statistical methods, to compare the properties among different methods, and to mimic the real data in genetic epidemiology studies. Conducting simulation studies can become a complicated task as several challenges can occur, such as the selection of an appropriate simulation tool and the specification of parameters in the simulation model. Although abundant simulated data have been generated for human genetic research, currently there is no public database designed specifically as a repository for these simulated data. With the lack of such database, for similar studies, similar simulations may have been repeated, which resulted in redundant works. We created an online platform, DBSIM, for simulation data sharing and discussion of simulation techniques for human genetic studies. DBSIM has a database containing simulation scripts, simulated data, and documentations from published manuscripts, as well as a discussion forum, which provides a platform for discussion of the simulated data and exchanging simulation ideas. DBSIM will be useful in three aspects. Moreover, summary statistics such as the simulation tools that are most commonly used and datasets that are most frequently downloaded are provided. The statistics will be very informative for researchers to choose an appropriate simulation tool or select a common dataset for method comparisons. DBSIM can be accessed at http://dbsim.nhri.org.tw."
10.1101/030239,"BackgroundThree to four gene expression-based subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have been previously reported. We sought to systematically determine the similarity of HGSC subtypes between populations.\n\nMethodsWe independently clustered (k = 3 and k = 4) five publicly-available HGSC mRNA expression datasets with >130 tumors using k-means and non-negative matrix factorization. Within each population, we summarized differential expression patterns for each cluster as moderated t statistic vectors using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. We calculated Pearsons correlations of these vectors to determine similarities and differences in expression patterns between clusters. We defined syn-clusters (SC) as sets of clusters that were strongly correlated across populations, and associated their expression patterns with biological pathways using geneset overrepresentation analyses.\n\nResultsAcross populations, for k = 3, moderated t score correlations for clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.80-0.90, and 0.65-0.77. For k = 4, correlations for clusters 1-4, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.83-0.89, 0.51-0.76, and 0.61-0.75. Within populations, comparing analogous clusters (k = 3 versus k = 4), correlations were high for clusters 1 and 2 (0.91-1.00), but were lower for cluster 3 (0.22-0.80). Results are similar using non-negative matrix factorization. SC1 corresponds to previously-reported mesenchymal-like, SC2 to proliferative-like, SC3 to immunoreactive-like, and SC4 to differentiated-like subtypes.\n\nConclusionsThe mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like subtypes are remarkably consistent across populations and could be uniquely targeted for treatment. The other two previously described subtypes are considerably less robust, and since cross-population comparison reveals that k = 3 and k = 4 are both consistent with our results, they may not represent clear subtypes."
10.1101/030346,"Biological introductions bring into contact species that can still hybridize. The evolutionary outcomes of such secondary contacts may be diverse (e.g. adaptive introgression from or into the introduced species) but are not yet well examined in the wild. The recent secondary contact between the non-native sea squirt Ciona robusta (formerly known as C. intestinalis type A) and its native congener C. intestinalis (formerly known as C. intestinalis type B), in the western English Channel, provides an excellent case study to examine. To examine contemporary hybridization between the two species, we developed a panel of 310 ancestry-informative SNPs from a population transcriptomic study. Hybridization rates were examined on 449 individuals sampled in 8 sites from the sympatric range and 5 sites from allopatric ranges. The results clearly showed an almost complete absence of contemporary hybridization between the two species in syntopic localities, with only one first generation hybrid and no other genotype compatible with recent backcrosses. Despite the almost lack of contemporary hybridization, shared polymorphisms were observed in sympatric and allopatric populations of both species. Furthermore, one allopatric population from SE Pacific exhibited a higher rate of shared polymorphisms compared to all other C. robusta populations. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed level of shared polymorphism is more probably the outcome of ancient gene flow spread afterwards at a worldwide scale. They also emphasise efficient reproductive barriers preventing hybridization between introduced and native species, which suggests hybridization should not impede too much the expansion and the establishment of the non-native species in its introduction range."
10.1101/030361,"Here we present the first dataset based on human microbiota samples of an urban middle-income population in South America. We characterized the microbiota of six different body habitats: palatine tonsils, saliva, buccal mucosa, throat, anterior nares and gut from samples of healthy individual living in a metropolitan area in Argentina. Our initial findings revealed differences in the structure and composition of the microbial communities compared to the US urban population. By sharing our data, we want to actively encourage its reuse for comparison purposes. This will hopefully result in novel biological insights on the variability of the microbiota of healthy individuals across populations worldwide. Moreover, the understanding of the human microbiota ecosystem in a health-associated state will help to answer questions related to the role of the microbiota in disease."
10.1101/030304,"All animals are able to rapidly change their behavior. The neural basis of such flexibility requires that groups of distant neural ensembles rapidly alter communications with selectivity and fidelity. Low frequency oscillations are a strong candidate for how neurons coordinate communication via the dynamic instantiation of functional networks. These dynamic networks are argued to rapidly guide the flow of information, with the presumption that stronger oscillations more strongly influence information flow. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence or theoretical support for how oscillatory activity might enhance information flow. Here we introduce a novel computational model for oscillatory neural communication and show that, rather than the strength of the oscillation, it is the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity that has the largest effect on information flow. When coupling between an oscillation and spiking has balanced excitatory-inhibitory inputs, information flow is enhanced via improved discriminability between signal and noise. In contrast, when coupling is unbalanced, driven either by excessive excitation or inhibition, information flow is obstructed, regardless of the strength of the oscillation. A multitude of neuropathologies, including Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and autism, are associated with oscillatory disruptions and excitation-inhibition imbalances. Our results show that understanding the distinction between balanced and unbalanced oscillatory coupling offers a unifying mechanistic framework for understanding effective neural communication and its disruption in neuropathology."
10.1101/030312,"SummaryIn this technical report we describe a simple extension to python-libSBML that allows users of Python to more easily construct SBML based models. The most commonly used package for constructing SBML models in Python is python-libSBML based on the C/C++ library libSBML. python-libSBML supports a comprehensive set of model types, but is difficult for new users to learn and requires long scripts to create even the simplest models. We present SimpleSBML, a package that allows users to add species, parameters, reactions, events, and rules to a libSBML model with only one command for each. Models can be exported to SBML format, and SBML files can be imported and converted to SimpleSBML commands that creates each element in a new model. This allows users to create new models and edit existing models for use with other software.

Accessibility and ImplementationSimpleSBML is publicly available and licensed under the liberal Apache 2.0 open source license. It supports SBML levels 2 and 3. Its only dependency is libSBML.

10.1101/030148,"Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral--and segregating at high frequency--in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.\n\nAuthor SummaryA small percentage of Neanderthal DNA is present in the genomes of many contemporary human populations due to hybridization tens of thousands of years ago. Much of this Neanderthal DNA appears to be deleterious in humans, and natural selection is acting to remove it. One hypothesis is that the underlying alleles were not deleterious in Neanderthals, but rather represent genetic incompatibilities that became deleterious only once they were introduced to the human population. If so, reproductive barriers must have evolved rapidly between Neanderthals and humans after their split. Here, we show that oberved patterns of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be explained simply as a consequence of the difference in effective population size between Neanderthals and humans. Specifically, we find that on average, selection against individual Neanderthal alleles is very weak. This is consistent with the idea that Neanderthals over time accumulated many weakly deleterious alleles that in their small population were effectively neutral. However, after introgressing into larger human populations, those alleles became exposed to purifying selection. Thus, rather than being the result of hybrid incompatibilities, differences between human and Neanderthal effective population sizes appear to have played a key role in shaping our present-day shared ancestry."
10.1101/030387,"Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression."
10.1101/030262,"Prostate cancer metastasis to the bone is predominantly lethal and results from the ability of successful metastatic prostate cancer cells to co-opt microenvironmental cells and processes involved in bone remodelling. Understanding how the interactions between tumour and stromal cells determine successful metastases and how metastatic tumours respond to treatment is an emergent process that is hard to asses biologically and thus can benefit from mathematical models. In this work we describe a mathematical model of bone remodelling and the establishment of a prostate cancer metastasis in the bone using evolutionary game theory. We have mathematically recapitulated the current paradigm of a vicious cycle driving the tumor growth and we have used this tool to investigate the key interactions between the tumour and the bone stroma. Crucially, the model sheds light on the role that the interactions of heterogeneous tumor cells with the bone microenvironment have in the treatment of cancer. Our results show that resistant populations naturally become dominant in the metastases under a number treatment schemes and that schedules designed by an evolutionary game theory approach could be used to better control the tumour and the associated bone growth than the current standard of care."
10.1101/030403,"The diversity of the immune repertoire is initially generated by random rearrangements of the receptor gene during early T and B cell development. Rearrangement scenarios are composed of random events - choices of gene templates, base pair deletions and insertions - described by probability distributions. Not all scenarios are equally likely, and the same receptor sequence may be obtained in several different ways. Quantifying the distribution of these rearrangements is an essential baseline for studying the immune system diversity. Inferring the properties of the distributions from receptor sequences is a computationally hard problem, requiring enumerating every possible scenario for every sampled receptor sequence. We present a Hidden Markov model, which accounts for all plausible scenarios that can generate the receptor sequences. We developed and implemented a method based on the Baum-Welch algorithm that can efficiently infer the parameters for the different events of the rearrangement process. We tested our software tool on sequence data for both the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor. To test the validity of our algorithm, we also generated synthetic sequences produced by a known model, and confirmed that its parameters could be accurately inferred back from the sequences. The inferred model can be used to generate synthetic sequences, to calculate the probability of generation of any receptor sequence, as well as the theoretical diversity of the repertoire. We estimate this diversity to be {approx} 1023 for human T cells. The model gives a baseline to investigate the selection and dynamics of immune repertoires.\n\nSource code and sample sequence files are available at https://bitbucket.org/yuvalel/repgenhmm/downloads."
10.1101/030411,"There has been intense debate over the immunological basis of schizophrenia, and the potential utility of adjunct immunotherapies. The major histocompatibility complex is consistently the most powerful region of association in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia, and has been interpreted as strong genetic evidence supporting the immune hypothesis. However, global pathway analyses provide inconsistent evidence of immune involvement in schizophrenia, and it remains unclear whether genetic data support an immune etiology per se. Here we empirically test the hypothesis that variation in immune genes contributes to schizophrenia. We show that there is no enrichment of immune loci outside of the MHC region in the largest genetic study of schizophrenia conducted to date, in contrast to five diseases of known immune origin. Among 108 regions of the genome previously associated with schizophrenia, we identify six immune candidates (DPP4, HSPD1, EGR1, CLU, ESAM, NFATC3) encoding proteins with alternative, nonimmune roles in the brain. While our findings do not refute evidence that has accumulated in support of the immune hypothesis, they suggest that genetically mediated alterations in immune function may not play a major role in schizophrenia susceptibility. Instead, there may be a role for pleiotropic effects of a small number of immune genes that also regulate brain development and plasticity. Whether immune alterations drive schizophrenia progression is an important question to be addressed by future research, especially in light of the growing interest in applying immunotherapies in schizophrenia."
10.1101/030395,"Many adaptive events in natural populations, as well as response to artificial selection, are caused by polygenic action. Under selective pressure, the adaptive traits can quickly respond via small allele frequency shifts spread across numerous loci. We hypothesize that a large proportion of current phenotypic variation between individuals may be best explained by population admixture.\n\nWe thus consider the complete, genome-wide universe of genetic variability, spread across several ancestral populations originally separated. We experimentally confirmed this hypothesis by predicting the differences in quantitative disease resistance levels among accessions in the wild legume Medicago truncatula. We discovered also that variation in genome admixture proportion explains most of phenotypic variation for several quantitative functional traits, but not for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. We shown that positive selection at the species level might not explain current, rapid adaptation.\n\nThese findings prove the infinitesimal model as a mechanism for adaptation of quantitative phenotypes. Our study produced the first evidence that the whole-genome modeling of DNA variants is the best approach to describe an inherited quantitative trait in a higher eukaryote organism and proved the high potential of admixture-based analyses. This insight contribute to the understanding of polygenic adaptation, and can accelerate plant and animal breeding, and biomedicine research programs."
10.1101/030437,"Recent emergence of nanopore sequencing technology set a challenge for the established assembly methods not optimized for the combination of read lengths and high error rates of nanopore reads. In this work we assessed how existing de novo assembly methods perform on these reads. We benchmarked three non-hybrid (in terms of both error correction and scaffolding) assembly pipelines as well as two hybrid assemblers which use third generation sequencing data to scaffold Illumina assemblies. Tests were performed on several publicly available MinION and Illumina datasets of E. coli K-12, using several sequencing coverages of nanopore data (20x, 30x, 40x and 50x). We attempted to assess the quality of assembly at each of these coverages, to estimate the requirements for closed bacterial genome assembly. Results show that hybrid methods are highly dependent on the quality of NGS data, but much less on the quality and coverage of nanopore data and perform relatively well on lower nanopore coverages. Furthermore, when coverage is above 40x, all non-hybrid methods correctly assemble the E. coli genome, even a non-hybrid method tailored for Pacific Bioscience reads. While it requires higher coverage compared to a method designed particularly for nanopore reads, its running time is significantly lower."
10.1101/030452,"Successful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis requires that each sister chromatid is captured by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. A multiprotein complex called the kinetochore provides an attachment site on chromosomes for microtubules. We have found that the prolylhydroxylase PHD2 is a critical regulator of the assembly of the kinetochore. PHD2 hydroxylates the kinetochore component CENP-N on P311 and is essential for CENP-N localization to kinetochores. Either depletion of PHD2, or expression of a hydroxylation-deficient mutant, results in loss of the histone H3 variant CENP-A from centromeres. Loss of CENP-N from chromatin bound protein complexes is not due to decreased protein stability but is a consequence of lowered affinity of CENP-N for binding CENP-L. Loss of hydroxylation also results in increased targeting of CENP-L to chromatin. Hydroxylation by PHD2 thus plays an important role in controlling the stoichiometry of mitotic kinetochore components."
10.1101/030288,"Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder affecting around 1 in 7 people worldwide, but its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Some debate exists over whether migraine is a disease of vascular dysfunction, or a result of neuronal dysfunction with secondary vascular changes. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have thus far identified 13 independent loci associated with migraine. To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed the largest genetic study of migraine to date, comprising 59,674 cases and 316,078 controls from 22 GWA studies. We identified 45 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with migraine risk (P < 5 x 10-8) that map to 38 distinct genomic loci, including 28 loci not previously reported and the first locus identified on chromosome X. Furthermore, a subset analysis for migraine without aura (MO) identified seven of the same loci as from the full sample, whereas no loci reached genome-wide significance in the migraine with aura (MA) subset. In subsequent computational analyzes, the identified loci showed enrichment for genes expressed in vascular and smooth muscle tissues, consistent with a predominant theory of migraine that highlights vascular etiologies."

10.1101/030494,"Reduced representation sequencing methods such as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) enable low-cost measurement of genetic variation without the need for a reference genome assembly. These methods are widely used in genetic mapping and population genetics studies, especially with non-model organisms. Variant calling error rates, however, are higher in GBS than in standard sequencing, in particular due to restriction site polymorphisms, and few computational tools exist that specifically model and correct these errors. We developed a statistical method to remove errors caused by restriction site polymorphisms, implemented in the software package GBStools. We evaluated it in several simulated data sets, varying in number of samples, mean coverage and population mutation rate, and in two empirical human data sets (N = 8 and N = 63 samples). In our simulations, GBStools improved genotype accuracy more than commonly used filters such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-values. GBStools is most effective at removing genotype errors in data sets over 100 samples when coverage is 40X or higher, and the improvement is most pronounced in species with high genomic diversity. We also demonstrate the utility of GBS and GBStools for human population genetic inference in Argentine populations and reveal widely varying individual ancestry proportions and an excess of singletons, consistent with recent population growth."

This rich new dataset includes samples from primary tissues, which to our knowledge have not previously been studied in this context. Specifically, we used computational machine learning algorithms on five histone modifications to predict gene expression in a variety of samples. Our models reveal a high predictive accuracy, especially in cell cultures, with predictive ability dependent on sample type and anatomy. The relative importance of each histone mark feature varied across samples. We localized each histone mark signal to its relevant region, revealing that chromatin state enrichment varies greatly between histone marks. Our results provide several novel insights into epigenetic regulation of transcription in new contexts."
10.1101/030569,"4C-Seq has proven to be a powerful technique to identify genome-wide interactions with a single locus of interest (or \""bait\"") that can be important for gene regulation. However, analysis of 4C-Seq data is complicated by the many biases inherent to the technique. An important consideration when dealing with 4C-Seq data is the differences in resolution of signal across the genome that result from differences in 3D distance separation from the bait. This leads to the highest signal in the region immediately surrounding the bait and increasingly lower signals in far-cis and trans. Another important aspect of 4C-Seq experiments is the resolution, which is greatly influenced by the choice of restriction enzyme and the frequency at which it can cut the genome. Thus, it is important that a 4C-Seq analysis method is flexible enough to analyze data generated using different enzymes and to identify interactions across the entire genome. Current methods for 4C-Seq analysis only identify interactions in regions near the bait or in regions located in far-cis and trans, but no method comprehensively analyzes 4C signals of different length scales. In addition, some methods also fail in experiments where chromatin fragments are generated using frequent cutter restriction enzymes. Here, we describe 4C-ker, a Hidden-Markov Model based pipeline that identifies regions throughout the genome that interact with the 4C bait locus. In addition we incorporate methods for the identification of differential interactions in multiple 4C-seq datasets collected from different genotypes or experimental conditions. Adaptive window sizes are used to correct for differences in signal coverage in near-bait regions, far-cis and trans chromosomes. Using several datasets, we demonstrate that 4C-ker outperforms all existing 4C-Seq pipelines in its ability to reproducibly identify interaction domains at all genomic ranges with different resolution enzymes.\n\nAUTHORS SUMMARYCircularized chromosome conformation capture, or 4C-Seq is a technique developed to identify regions of the genome that are in close spatial proximity to a single locus of interest ( bait). This technique is used to detect regulatory interactions between promoters and enhancers and to characterize the nuclear environment of different regions within and across different cell types. So far, existing methods for 4C-Seq data analysis do not comprehensively identify interactions across the entire genome due to biases in the technique that are related to the decrease in 4C signal that results from increased 3D distance from the bait. To compensate for these weaknesses in existing methods we developed 4C-ker, a method that explicitly models these biases to improve the analysis of 4C-Seq to better understand the genome wide interaction profile of an individual locus."
10.1101/030551,"Large-scale biological networks map functional connections between most genes in the genome and can potentially uncover high level organizing principles governing cellular functions. These networks, however, are famously complex and often regarded as disordered masses of tangled interactions (\""hairballs\"") that are nearly impenetrable to biologists. As a result, our current understanding of network functional organization is very limited. To address this problem, I developed a systematic quantitative approach for annotating biological networks and examining their functional structure. This method, named Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), detects network regions that are statistically overrepresented for a functional group or a quantitative phenotype of interest, and provides an intuitive visual representation of their relative positioning within the network. By successfully annotating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic interaction network with Gene Ontology terms, SAFE proved to be sensitive to functional signals and robust to noise. In addition, SAFE annotated the network with chemical genomic data and uncovered a new potential mechanism of resistance to the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. Finally, SAFE showed that protein-protein interactions, despite their apparent complexity, also have a high level functional structure. These results demonstrate that SAFE is a powerful new tool for examining biological networks and advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the cell."

Genetic linkage analysis has identified mutations in myosin Vb gene as the main cause of MVID. An animal model that develops ex-utero and is tractable genetically as well as by microscopy would be highly useful to study the cellular basis of the formation of inclusion bodies.\n\nResultsHere we report that the intestine of the zebrafish goosepimples (gsp)/myosin Vb (myoVb) mutant show severe reduction in the intestinal folds-structures similar to mammalian villi. The loss of folds is further correlated with changes in the shape of enterocytes. In a striking similarity with MVID patients, zebrafish gsp/myoVb mutant larvae exhibit microvillus atrophy, microvillus inclusions and accumulation of secretory material in enterocytes.\n\nConclusionWe propose that the zebrafish gsp/myoVb mutant is a valuable model to study the pathophysiology of MVID. Owing to the advantages of zebrafish in screening libraries of small molecules, the gsp mutant will be an appropriate tool to identify compounds that would alleviate the formation of microvillus inclusions and have therapeutic value."

Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is the only hexaploid conifer and one of just two naturally polyploid conifer species. Numerous hypotheses about the mechanism of polyploidy in Sequoia and parental genome donors have been proffered over the years, primarily based on morphological and cytological data, but it remains unclear how Sequoia became polyploid and why this lineage overcame an apparent gymnosperm barrier to whole-genome duplication (WGD).\nC_LIO_LIWe sequenced transcriptomes and used phylogenetic inference, Bayesian concordance analysis, and paralog age distributions to resolve relationships among gene copies in hexaploid coast redwood and its close relatives.\nC_LIO_LIOur data show that hexaploidy in the coast redwood lineage is best explained by autopolyploidy or, if there was allopolyploidy, this was restricted to within the Californian redwood clade. We found that duplicate genes have more similar sequences than would be expected given evidence from fossil guard cell size which suggest that polyploidy dates to the Eocene.\nC_LIO_LIConflict between molecular and fossil estimates of WGD can be explained if diploidization occurred very slowly following whole genome duplication. We extrapolate from this to suggest that the rarity of polyploidy in conifers may be due to slow rates of diploidization in this clade.\nC_LI"
10.1101/030593,"Measures of similarity between diseases have been used for applications from discovering drug-target interactions to identifying disease-gene relationships. It is challenging to quantitatively compare diseases because much of what we know about them is captured in free text descriptions. Here we present an application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation as a way to measure similarity between diseases using textual descriptions. We learn latent topic representations of text from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man records and use them to compute similarity. We assess the performance of this approach by comparing our results to manually curated relationships from the Disease Ontology. Despite being unsupervised, our model recovers a records curated Disease Ontology relations with a mean Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 0.80. With low dimensional models, topics tend to represent higher level information about affected organ systems, while higher dimensional models capture more granular genetic and phenotypic information. We examine topic representations of diseases for mapping concepts between ontologies and for tagging existing text with concepts. We conclude topic modeling on disease text leads to a robust approach to computing similarity that does not depend on keywords or ontology."
10.1101/030528,"Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soy-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity."
10.1101/030544,"Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) and sub-tomogram averaging allow structure determination of macromolecules in situ, and are gaining in popularity for initial model generation for single-particle analysis. We describe herein, a protocol for sub-tomogram averaging from cryo-ET data using the RELION software. We describe how to calculate newly developed three-dimensional models for the contrast transfer function and the missing wedge of each sub-tomogram, and how to use these models for regularized-likelihood refinement. This approach has been implemented in the existing workflow for single-particle analysis, so that users may conveniently tap into existing capabilities of the RELION software. As example applications, we present analyses of purified hepatitis B capsid particles and S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes. In both cases, we show that following initial classification, sub-tomogram averaging in RELION allows de novo generation of initial models, and provides high-resolution maps where secondary structure elements are resolved."
10.1101/030601,"AbstractThe hydride shift mechanism of D-Xylose Isomerase converts D-glucose to D-fructose. In this work, we compute features of a \""hydroxide once\"" mechanism for the hydride shift with quantum chemical calculations based on the 3KCO (linear) and 3KCL (cyclic) X-ray/neutron structures. The rigid boundary conditions of the active site \""shoe-box\"", together with ionization states and proton orientations, enables large scale electronic structure calculations of the entire active site with greatly reduced configuration sampling. In the reported hydroxide once mechanism, magnesium in the 2A ligation shifts to position 2B, ionizing the O2 proton of D-glucose, which is accepted by ASP-287. In this step a novel stabilization is discovered; the K183/D255 proton toggle, providing a ~10 kcal/mol stabilization through inductive polarization over 5[A]. Then, hydride shifts from glucose-O2 to glucose-O1 (the interconversion) generating hydroxide (once) from the catalytic water. This step is consistent with the observation of hyroxide in structure 3CWH, which we identify as a branch point. From this branch point, we find several routes to the solvent-free regeneration of catalytic water that is strongly exothermic (by ~20 kcal/mol), yielding one additional hydrogen bond more than the starting structure. This non-Michaelis behavior, strongly below the starting cyclic and linear total energy, explains the observed accumulation of hydroxide intermediate - we postulate that forming permissive ionization states, required for cyclization, may be the rate limiting step. In all, we find eight items of experimental correspondence supporting features of the putative hydroxide once mechanism."
10.1101/030577,"The circadian clock is a fundamental feature of gene regulation and cell physiology in eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, and an exemplar gene regulatory network in Systems Biology. The circadian system in Arabidopsis thaliana is complex in part due to its photo-transduction pathways. Analysis of natural genetic variation between Arabidopsis accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) identified a major, temperature-specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome V that altered the circadian period of leaf movement (Edwards et al., Genetics, 2005). We tested Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) to confirm that Ler alleles at this PerCv5c QTL lengthened the circadian period at 12{degrees}C, with little effect at higher temperatures. The PHYTOCHROME C gene lies within the QTL interval, and contains multiple sequence variants. Plants carrying either a T-DNA-insertion into PHYC or a deletion of PHYC also lengthened circadian period under white light, except at 27{degrees}C. phyB and phyABE mutants lengthened period only at 12{degrees}C. These results extend recent data showing PhyC effects in red light, confirming the number of photoreceptor proteins implicated in the plant circadian system at eleven. The connection between light input mechanisms and temperature effects on the clock is reinforced. Natural genetic variation within PHYC is likely to underlie the PerCv5c QTL. Our results suggest that functional variation within the PHYC-Ler haplotype group might contribute to the evolution of the circadian system and possibly to clock-related phenotypes such as flowering time. These results have previously passed peer-review, so we provide them in this citable preprint."
10.1101/030619,"While eukaryotic noncoding RNAs have recently received intense scrutiny, it is becoming clear that bacterial transcription is at least as pervasive. Bacterial small RNAs and antisense RNAs (sRNAs) are often assumed to be noncoding, due to their lack of long open reading frames (ORFs). However, there are numerous examples of sRNAs encoding for small proteins, whether or not they also have a regulatory role at the RNA level. Here, we apply flexible machine learning techniques based on sequence features and comparative genomics to quantify the prevalence of sRNA ORFs under natural selection to maintain protein-coding function in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. A majority of annotated sRNAs have at least one ORF between 10 and 50 amino acids long, and we conservatively predict that 188{+/-}25.5 unannotated sRNA ORFs are under selection to maintain coding, an average of 13 per species considered here. This implies that overall at least 7.5 {+/-}0.3% of sRNAs have a coding ORF, and in some species at least 20% do. 84 {+/-} 9.8 of these novel coding ORFs have some antisense overlap to annotated ORFs. As experimental validation, many of our predictions are translated according to ribosome profiling data and are identified via mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics. B. subtilis sRNAs with coding ORFs are enriched for high expression in biofilms and confluent growth, and two S. pneumoniae sRNAs with coding ORFs are involved in virulence. sRNA coding ORFs are enriched for transmembrane domains and many are novel components of type I toxin/antitoxin systems. Our predictions for sRNA coding ORFs, including novel type I toxins, are freely available in a user-friendly format at http://disco-bac.web.pasteur.fr."
10.1101/030650,"The growth in genome-scale assays of gene expression for different species in publicly available databases presents new opportunities for computational methods that aid in hypothesis generation and biological interpretation of these data. Here, we present an unsupervised machine-learning approach, ADAGE (Analysis using Denoising Autoencoders of Gene Expression) and apply it to the interpretation of all of the publicly available gene expression data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen. In post-hoc positive control analyses using curated knowledge, the P. aeruginosa ADAGE model found that co-operonic genes often participated in similar processes and accurately predicted which genes had similar functions. By analyzing newly generated data and previously published microarray and RNA-seq data, the ADAGE model identified gene expression differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes despite low level expression differences in directly involved genes. Comparison of ADAGE with PCA and ICA revealed that ADAGE extracts distinct signals. We provide the ADAGE model with analysis of all publicly available P. aeruginosa GeneChip experiments, and we provide open source code for use in other species and settings."
10.1101/030718,"Spatial aggregation or clustering of membrane proteins could be important for their functionality, e.g., in signaling, and nanoscale imaging can be used to study its origins, structure and function. Such studies require accurate characterization of clusters, both for absolute quantification and hypothesis testing. A set of model-free quantification approaches -- free of specific cluster models-- have been proposed for this purpose. They include the radius of maximal aggregation ra obtained from the maxima of the empirical Besag L(r) - r function as an estimator of cluster size, and the estimation of various cluster parameters based on an exponential approximation for the Pair Correlation Function(PCF). However, the parameter identifiability and bias and scaling due to their model-free nature are not clear. In practice, the clusters might exhibit specific patterns, and the behavior of these estimators in such cases must be studied. Here, we theoretically analyze these approaches for a set of cluster models, and obtain information about their identifiability and bias. We find that the ratio between ra and true cluster size depends on both the true size as well as the number of clusters per unit area, or other corresponding parameters, in a model-dependent manner. In particular, ra scales with respect to the true size by a factor that can be arbitrarily large, depending on models and parameter values. For the method based on PCF approximation, for most models we analyzed, the ratios between approximate and true model parameters were found to be constants that depend only on models and independent of other parameters. For the models analyzed, this ratio was within {+/-}100%. Our theoretical approach was validated by means of simulations. We also discuss some general issues in inference using second-order spatial properties. While precision could also be key, such information on identifiability and accuracy provides clarity on estimation, can lead to better inference, and can also fuel more accurate method development."
10.1101/030692,"Metagenome shotgun sequence projects offer the potential for large scale biogeographic analysis of microbial species. In this project we developed a method for detecting 33 common subtypes of the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. We used a binomial mixture model implemented in the binstrain software and the coverage counts at > 100,000 known S. aureus SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) sites derived from prior comparative genomic analysis to estimate the proportion of each subtype in metagenome samples. Using this pipeline we were able to obtain > 87% sensitivity and > 94% specificity when testing on low genome coverage samples of diverse S. aureus strains (0.025X). We found that 321 and 149 metagenome samples from the Human Microbiome Project and metaSUB analysis of the New York City subway, respectively, contained S. aureus at genome coverage > 0.025. In both projects, CC8 and CC30 were the most common S. aureus subtypes encountered. We found evidence that the subtype composition at different body sites of the same individual were more similar than random sampling and more limited evidence that certain body sites were enriched for particular subtypes. One surprising finding was the apparent high frequency of CC398, a lineage associated with livestock, in samples from the tongue dorsum. Epidemiologic analysis of the HMP subject population suggested that high BMI (body mass index) and health insurance are risk factors for S. aureus but there was limited power to find factors linked to carriage of even the most common subtype. In the NYC subway data, we found a small signal of geographic distance affecting subtype clustering but other unknown factors influence taxonomic distribution of the species around the city. We argue that pathogen detection in metagenome samples requires the use of subtypes based on whole species population genomic analysis rather than using ad hoc collections of reference strains."
10.1101/030700,"Spike patterns are among the most common electrophysiological descriptors of neuron types. Surprisingly, it is not clear how the diversity in firing patterns of the neurons in a network affects its activity dynamics. Here, we introduce the state-dependent stochastic bursting neuron model allowing for a change in its firing patterns independent of changes in its input-output firing rate relationship. Using this model, we show that the effect of single neuron spiking on the network dynamics is contingent on the network activity state. While spike bursting can both generate and disrupt oscillations, these patterns are ineffective in large regions of the network state space in changing the network activity qualitatively. Finally, we show that when single-neuron properties are made dependent on the population activity, a hysteresis like dynamics emerges. This novel phenomenon has important implications for determining the network response to time-varying inputs and for the network sensitivity at different operating points."
10.1101/030825,"SummaryAdvances in sequencing capacity have lead to the generation of unprecedented amounts of genomic data. The processing of this data frequently leads to I/O bottlenecks, e. g. when analyzing a small genomic region across a large number of samples. The largest I/O burden is, however, often not imposed by the amount of data needed for the analysis but rather by index files that help retrieving this data. We have developed chopBAI, a program that can chop a BAM index (BAI) file into small pieces. The program outputs a list of BAI files each indexing a specified genomic interval. The output files are much smaller in size but maintain compatibility with existing software tools. We show how preprocessing BAI files with chopBAI can lead to a reduction of I/O by more than 95% during the analysis of 10 Kbp genomic regions, eventually enabling the joint analysis of more than 10,000 individuals.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed and available at http://github.com/DecodeGenetics/chopBAI"
10.1101/030783,"Shared genetic architecture between phenotypes may be driven by a common genetic basis (pleiotropy) or a subset of genetically similar individuals (heterogeneity). We developed BUHMBOX, a well-powered statistical method to distinguish pleiotropy from heterogeneity using genotype data. We observed a shared genetic basis between 11 of 17 tested autoimmune diseases and type I diabetes (T1D, p<10-12) and 11 of 17 tested autoimmune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, p<10-7). This sharing could not be explained by heterogeneity (corrected pBUHMBOX>0.2 using 6,670 T1D cases and 7,279 RA cases), suggesting that shared genetic features in autoimmunity are due to pleiotropy. We observed a shared genetic basis between seronegative and seropostive RA (p<10-22), explained by heterogeneity (pBUHMBOX=0.008 in 2,406 seronegative RA cases). Consistent with previous observations, we observed genetic sharing between major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (p<10-9). This sharing is not explained by heterogeneity (pBUHMBOX=0.28 in 9,238 MDD cases)."
10.1101/030742,"Whole genome sequencing on next-generation instruments provides an unbiased way to identify the organisms present in complex metagenomic samples. However, the time-to-result can be protracted because of fixed-time sequencing runs and cumbersome bioinformatics workflows.

Here we present Whats in my Pot?

10.1101/030791,"Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an increasingly useful approach for modeling the behavior of metabolic systems. However, standard FBA modeling of genetic knockouts can not predict drug combination synergies observed between serial metabolic targets, even though such synergies give rise to some of the most widely used antibiotic treatments. Here we extend FBA modeling to simulate responses to chemical inhibitors at varying concentrations, by diverting enzymatic flux to a waste reaction. This flux diversion yields very similar qualitative predictions to prior methods for single target activity. However, we find very different predictions for combinations, where flux diversion, which mimics the kinetics of competitive metabolic inhibitors, can explain serial target synergies between metabolic enzyme inhibitors that we confirmed in Escherichia coli cultures. FBA flux diversion opens the possibility for more accurate genome-scale predictions of drug synergies, which can be used to suggest treatments for infections and other diseases."
10.1101/030676,"PrefaceThe molecular mechanisms and signalling pathways that regulate the in vitro preservation of distinct pluripotent stem cell configurations, and their induction in somatic cells via direct reprogramming approaches, continue to constitute a highly exciting area of research. In this review, we provide an integrative synthesis on recent discoveries related to isolating unique naive and primed pluripotent stem cell states with altered functional and molecular characteristics, and from different species. We overview pathways underlying pluripotent state transitions and interconversion in vitro and in vivo. We conclude by highlighting unresolved key questions, future directions and potential novel applications of such dynamic pluripotent cell states."
10.1101/030833,"Although fitness costs associated with plant defensive traits are widely expected, they are not universally detected, calling into question their generality. Here we examine the potential for life history trade-offs associated with herbicide resistance by examining seed germination, root growth, and above-ground growth across 43 naturally occurring populations of Ipomoea purpurea that vary in their resistance to RoundUp(R), the most commonly used herbicide worldwide. We find evidence for life history trade-offs associated with all three traits; highly resistant populations had lower germination rates, shorter roots and smaller above-ground size. A visual exploration of the data indicated that the type of trade-off may differ among populations. Our results demonstrate that costs of adaptation may be present at stages other than simply the production of progeny in this agricultural weed. Additionally, the cumulative effect of costs at multiple life cycle stages can result in severe consequences to fitness when adapting to novel environments."
10.1101/030759,"The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), plays an important immunomodulatory role, regulating transcription of genes in the innate and adaptive immune system. The present study examines patterns of transcriptome-wide response to 1,25D and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in primary human monocytes, to elucidate pathways underlying the effects of 1,25D on the immune system. Monocytes obtained from healthy individuals of African-African and European-American ancestry were treated with 1,25D alone or in the presence of LPS, which induced significant up-regulation of genes in the antimicrobial and autophagy pathways, while pro-inflammatory response genes were significantly down-regulated. A joint Bayesian analysis enabled clustering of genes into patterns of shared transcriptional response across treatments. The biological pathways enriched within these expression patterns highlighted several mechanisms through which 1,25D could exert its immunomodulatory role. Pathways such as mTOR signaling, EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and Tec Kinase signaling were enriched among genes with opposite transcriptional responses to 1,25D and LPS, respectively, highlighting the important roles of these pathways in mediating the immunomodulatory activity of 1,25D. Furthermore, a subset of genes with evidence of inter-ethnic differences in transcriptional response was also identified, suggesting that in addition to the well-established inter-ethnic variation in circulating levels of vitamin D, the intensity of transcriptional response to 1,25D and LPS also varies between ethnic groups. We propose that dysregulation of the pathways identified in this study could contribute to immune-mediated disease risk."
10.1101/030858,"Locally adapted populations are often used as model systems for the early stages of ecological speciation, but most of these young divergent lineages will never become complete species. While the collapse of incipient species is theoretically common, very few examples have been documented in nature. Here I show that soapberry bugs (Jadera haematoloma) have lost adaptations to their native host plant (Cardiospermum corindum) and are regionally specializing on an invasive host plant (Koelreuteria elegans), collapsing a classic and well-documented example of local adaptation. All populations that were adapted to the native host - including those still found on that host today - are now better adapted to the invasive in multiple phenotypes. Weak differentiation remains in two traits, suggesting that homogenization across the region is incomplete. This study highlights the potential for adaptation to invasive species to disrupt native communities by swamping adaptation to native conditions through maladaptive gene flow."

10.1101/030767,"In contrast to XX/XY species, Z-linked expression is overall reduced in female WZ/ZZ species compared to males or the autosomal expression. This pattern (Z<ZZ{approx}AA) has been consistently reported in all the WZ/ZZ taxa examined so far, with the singular exception of the insect order of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). However, conflicting results linger in this taxon due to discrepancies in data analyses and tissues sampled. To address this issue, we analyzed dosage compensation in the codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae) using tissues that represent different levels of sexual divergence. C. pomonella is the most basal lepidopteran species yet examined for dosage compensation and has a neo-Z chromosome resulting from an ancient Z:autosome translocation. We based our analyses on RNAseq and de novo transcriptome data from C. pomonella, as well as scrutiny into investigations of other lepidopteran species. Our evidence supports that the lepidopterans share a pattern (Z {approx} ZZ < AA) of dosage compensation that mirrors the eutherian mammals (X {approx} XX < AA). In particular, reproductive tissues appear to be exempt from dosage compensation, which helps explain the incongruence in prior reports. Furthermore, C. pomonella ancestral-Z segment exhibited a greater expression reduction than genes on the neo-Z segment, which intriguingly also reflects the differential up-regulation between the ancestral and newly-acquired X-linked genes in mammals. The insect order of Lepidoptera challenges both the classic theories regarding evolution of sex chromosome dosage compensation and the emerging view on dosage compensations association with sexual heterogamety."
10.1101/030668,"BackgroundEscherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has emerged globally as the most predominant lineage within this clinically important species, and its association with fluoroquinolone and extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance impacts significantly on treatment. The evolutionary histories of this lineage, and of important antimicrobial resistance elements within it, remain unclearly defined.\n\nResultsThis study of the largest worldwide collection (n = 215) of sequenced ST131 E. coli isolates to date demonstrates that clonal expansion of two previously recognized antimicrobial-resistant clades, C1/H30R and C2/H30Rx, started around 25 years ago, consistent with the widespread introduction of fluoroquinolones and extended-spectrum cephalosporins in clinical medicine. These two clades appear to have emerged in the United States, with the expansion of the C2/H30Rx clade driven by the acquisition of a blaCTX-M-15-containing IncFII-like plasmid that has subsequently undergone extensive rearrangement. Several other evolutionary processes influencing the trajectory of this drug-resistant lineage are described, including sporadic acquisitions of CTX-M resistance plasmids, and chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M within sub-clusters followed by vertical evolution. These processes are also occurring for another family of CTX-M gene variants more recently observed amongst ST131, the blaCTX-M-14/14-like group.\n\nConclusionsThe complexity of the evolutionary history of ST131 has important implications for antimicrobial resistance surveillance, epidemiological analysis, and control of emerging clinical lineages of E. coli. These data also highlight the global imperative to reduce specific antibiotic selection pressures, and demonstrate the important and varied roles played by plasmids and other mobile genetic elements in the perpetuation of antimicrobial resistance within lineages."

10.1101/030916,"The  priming effect, in which addition of labile substances changes the rem-ineralization rate of recalcitrant organic matter, has been intensively studied in soils, but is less well-documented in aquatic systems. We investigated the extent to which additions of nutrients or labile organic carbon could influence remineralization rates of 14C-labeled, microbially-degraded, phytoplankton-derived organic matter (OM) in microcosms inoculated with microbial communities drawn from Groves Creek Estuary in coastal Georgia, USA. We found that amendment with labile protein plus phosphorus increased remineralization rates of degraded, phytoplankton-derived OM by up to 100%, whereas acetate slightly decreased remineralization rates relative to an unamended control. Addition of ammonium and phosphate induced a smaller effect, whereas addition of ammonium alone had no effect. Counterintuitively, alkaline phosphatase activities increased in response to the addition of protein under P-replete conditions, indicating that production of enzymes unrelated to the labile priming compound may be a mechanism for the priming effect. The observed priming effect was transient: after 36 days of incubation roughly the same quantity of organic carbon had been mineralized in all treatments including no-addition controls. This timescale is on the order of the typical hydrologic residence times of well-flushed estuaries suggesting that priming in estuaries has the potential to influence whether OC is remineralized in situ or exported to the coastal ocean."
10.1101/030932,"O_LIPremise of the study: Hybridization between diploids and tetraploids can lead to new allopolyploid species, often via a triploid intermediate. Viable triploids are often produced asymmetrically, with greater success observed for \""maternal-excess\"" crosses where the mother has a higher ploidy than the father. Here we investigate the evolutionary origins of Mimulus peregrinus, an allohexaploid recently derived from the triploid M. x robertsii, to determine whether reproductive asymmetry has shaped the formation of this new species.\nC_LIO_LIMethods: We used reciprocal crosses between the diploid (M. guttatus) and tetraploid (M. luteus) progenitors to determine the viability of triploid M. x robertsii hybrids resulting from paternal-versus maternal-excess crosses. To investigate whether experimental results predict patterns seen in the field, we performed parentage analyses comparing natural populations of M. peregrinus to its diploid, tetraploid, and triploid progenitors. Organellar sequences obtained from pre-existing genomic data, supplemented with additional genotyping was used to establish the maternal ancestry of multiple M. peregrinus and M. x robertsii populations.\nC_LIO_LIKey results: We find strong evidence for asymmetric origins of M. peregrinus, but opposite to the common pattern, with paternal-excess crosses significantly more successful than maternal-excess crosses. These results successfully predicted hybrid formation in nature: 111 of 114 M. x robertsii individuals, and 27 of 27 M. peregrinus, had an M. guttatus maternal haplotype.\nC_LIO_LIConclusion: This study, which includes the first Mimulus chloroplast genome assembly, demonstrates the utility of parentage analysis through genome skimming.

10.1101/030874,"The study of modularity in morphological systems has increased in the past twenty years, parallel to the popularization of geometric morphometrics, which has led to the emergence of different criteria for detecting modularity on landmark data. However, compared to usual covariance matrix estimators, Procrustes estimators have properties that hinder their use. Here, we compare different representations of form, focusing on detecting modularity patterns defined a priori; we also compare two metrics: one derived from traditional morphometrics (MHI) and another that emerged in the context of landmark data (RV). Using Anthropoid skulls, we compare these metrics over three representations of form: interlandmark distances, Procrustes residuals, and local shape variables. Over Procrustes residuals, both tests fail to detect modularity patterns, while in remaining representations they show the distinction between early and late development in skull ontogeny. To estimate type I and II error rates, we built covariance matrices of known structure; these tests indicate that, considering both effect and sample sizes, tests using MHI are more robust than those using RV. However, both metrics have low power when used on Procrustes residuals. Thus, we conclude that the influence of development and function is poorly represented on Procrustes estimators for covariance matrices."
10.1101/030908,"We present a dynamical model of drug accumulation in bacteria. The model captures key features in experimental time courses on ofloxacin accumulation: initial uptake; two-phase response; and long-term acclimation. In combination with experimental data, the model provides estimates of import and export rates in each phase, the time of entry into the second phase, and the decrease of internal drug during acclimation. Global sensitivity analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the model provide information about the robustness of these estimates, and about the relative importance of different parameters in determining the features of the accumulation time courses in three different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results lead to experimentally testable predictions of the effects of membrane permeability, drug efflux and trapping (e.g., by DNA binding) on drug accumulation. A key prediction is that a sudden increase in ofloxacin accumulation in both E. coli and S. aureus is accompanied by a decrease in membrane permeability.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacteria live or die depending on how much antibiotic gets inside them. Using a simple mathematical model, detailed information about drug import and export can be teased out of time courses of internal drug levels after a sudden exposure. The results suggest that membrane permeability can suddenly decrease during exposure to drug, accompanied by an increase, rather than a decrease, in the internal drug level."
10.1101/030965,"IVF related intrauterus growth restriction or low birth weight (LBW) is very common in ART clinic. This study is focus on the aberrant lipid metabolism induced by in vitro fertilization and its mechanism. Firstly, we investigated the effect of IVF on fetal weight and placenta efficiency at E18.5 (at birth) and E14.5 (middle gestation). Data shows that IVF caused LBW and low placenta efficiency. Then we studied the lipidomics of E18.5 placenta and E14.5 placenta. The IVF group has an eccentric lipid content compared to in vivo group. All the 15 lipid classes are largely accumulated in E18.5 IVF placenta and are deficient in E14.5 IVF placenta. In detail, most of the 287 lipid species is accumulated at E18.5 and went short at E14.5. Using qRT-PCR we detected the expression level of genes related to lipid uptake, transport and metabolism. Most of these genes are down-regulated which indicated the metabolism function of placenta is disrupted seriously. To the imprinted genes for lipid metabolism regulation as GNAS and Grb10, IVF not only disrupt their imprinting status (methylation level) but also disrupt their gene expression. The expression of DNMTs and Tets are also disrupted in the placenta. These data demonstrate that IVF impaired the regulation network of lipid metabolism. These results prove the hypothesis: imperfect IVF condition of fertilization jeopardize the expression DNMTs, Tets and imprinting status of imprinted genes for lipid metabolism regulation. Then it causes to abnormal expression of genes for lipid metabolism and regulation. This leads to the significant differences in lipid species quantification and lipid metabolism. So it contributed to low lipid transport efficiency, restricted fetal growth and LBW. This study provides a renewed knowledge of lipid metabolism in placenta and its relation to imprinted genes and gave some clinical aware for optimizing the ART practice.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by grants from the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\nCompeting InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nAbbreviations"
10.1101/030940,"The joint and accurate inference of selection and demography from genetic data is considered a particularly challenging question in population genetics, since both process may lead to very similar patterns of genetic diversity. However, additional information for disentangling these effects may be obtained by observing changes in allele frequencies over multiple time points. Such data is common in experimental evolution studies, as well as in the comparison of ancient and contemporary samples. Leveraging this information, however, has been computationally challenging, particularly when considering multi-locus data sets. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel, discrete approximation for diffusion processes, termed mean transition time approximation, which preserves the long-term behavior of the underlying continuous diffusion process. We then derive this approximation for the particular case of inferring selection and demography from time series data under the classic Wright-Fisher model and demonstrate that our approximation is well suited to describe allele trajectories through time, even when only a few states are used. We then develop a Bayesian inference approach to jointly infer the population size and locus-specific selection coefficients with high accuracy, and further extend this model to also infer the rates of sequencing errors and mutations. We finally apply our approach to recent experimental data on the evolution of drug resistance in Influenza virus, identifying likely targets of selection and finding evidence for much larger viral population sizes than previously reported."
10.1101/030924,"Numerous studies have identified prognostic genes in individual cancers, but a thorough pancancer analysis has not been performed. In addition, previous studies have mostly used microarray data instead of RNA-SEQ, and have not published comprehensive lists of associations with survival. Using recently available RNA-SEQ and clinical data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas for 6,495 patients, I have investigated every annotated and expressed gene's association with survival across 16 cancer types. The most statistically significant harmful and protective genes were not shared across cancers, but were enriched in distinct gene sets which were shared across certain groups of cancers. These groups of cancers were independently recapitulated by both unsupervised clustering of Cox coefficients (a measure of association with survival) for individual genes, and for gene programs. This analysis has revealed unappreciated commonalities among cancers which may provide insights into cancer pathogenesis and rationales for co-opting treatments between cancers."
10.1101/030957,"The shape of leaves are dynamic, changing over evolutionary time between species, within a single plant producing different shaped leaves at successive nodes, during the development of a single leaf as it allometrically expands, and in response to the environment. Notably, strong correlations between the dissection and size of leaves with temperature and precipitation exist in both the paleorecord and extant populations. Yet, a morphometric model integrating evolutionary, developmental, and environmental effects on leaf shape is lacking. Here, we continue a morphometric analysis of >5,500 leaves representing 270 grapevines of multiple Vitis species between two growing seasons. Leaves are paired one-to-one, vine-to-vine accounting for developmental context, between growing seasons. Linear Discriminant Analysis reveals shape features that specifically define growing season, regardless of species or developmental context. The shape feature, a more pronounced distal sinus, is associated with the colder, drier growing season, consistent with patterns observed in the paleorecord. We discuss the implications of such plasticity in a long-lived woody perennial, such as grapevine, with respect to the evolution and functionality of plant morphology and changes in climate."
10.1101/031013,"Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and related methods are based on high-throughput short-read sequencing of genomic complexity reductions followed by discovery of SNPs within sequence tags. This provides a powerful and economical approach to whole-genome genotyping, facilitating applications in genomics, diversity analysis, and molecular breeding. However, due to the complexity of analysing large data sets, applications of GBS may require substantial time, expertise and computational resources. Haplotag, the novel GBS software described here, is freely available and operates with minimal user-investment on widely-available computer platforms. Haplotag is unique in fulfilling the following set of criteria: (1) operates without a reference genome; (2) can be used in a polyploid species; (3) provides a discovery mode and a production mode; (4) discovers polymorphisms based on a model of tag-level haplotypes within sequenced tags; (5) reports SNPs as well as haplotype-based genotypes; (6) provides an intuitive visual \""passport\"" for each inferred locus. Haplotag is optimized for use in a self-pollinating plant species."
10.1101/030999,"Many disease-related genotype variations (GVs) reside in non-gene coding regions and the mechanisms of their association with diseases are largely unknown. A possible impact of GVs on disease formation is to alter the spatial organization of chromosome. However, the relationship between GVs and 3D genome structure has not been studied at the chromosome scale. The kilobase resolution of chromosomal structures measured by Hi-C have provided an unprecedented opportunity to tackle this problem. Here we proposed a network-based method to capture global properties of the chromosomal structure. We uncovered that genome organization is scale free and the genomic loci interacting with many other loci in space, termed as hubs, are critical for stabilizing local chromosomal structure. Importantly, we found that cancer-specific GVs target hubs to drastically alter the local chromosomal interactions. These analyses revealed the general principles of 3D genome organization and provided a new direction to pinpoint genotype variations in non-coding regions that are critical for disease formation."
10.1101/030973,"Myriapods are one of the dominant terrestrial arthropod groups including the diverse and familiar centipedes and millipedes. Although molecular evidence has shown that Myriapoda is monophyletic, its internal phylogeny remains contentious and understudied, especially when compared to those of Chelicerata and Hexapoda. Until now, efforts have focused on taxon sampling (e.g., by including a handful of genes in many species) or on maximizing matrix occupancy (e.g., by including hundreds or thousands of genes in just a few species), but a phylogeny maximizing sampling at both levels remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed forty Illumina transcriptomes representing three myriapod classes (Diplopoda, Chilopoda and Symphyla); twenty-five transcriptomes were newly sequenced to maximize representation at the ordinal level in Diplopoda and at the family level in Chilopoda. Eight supermatrices were constructed to explore the effect of several potential phylogenetic biases (e.g., rate of evolution, heterotachy) at three levels of mean gene occupancy per taxon (50%, 75% and 90%). Analyses based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian mixture models retrieved monophyly of each myriapod class, and resulted in two alternative phylogenetic positions for Symphyla, as sister group to Diplopoda + Chilopoda, or closer to Diplopoda, the latter hypothesis having been traditionally supported by morphology. Within centipedes, all orders were well supported, but two nodes remained in conflict in the different analyses despite dense taxon sampling at the family level, situating the order Scolopendromorpha as sister group to a morphologically-anomalous grouping of Lithobiomorpha + Geophilomorpha in a subset of analyses. Interestingly, this anomalous result was obtained for all analyses conducted with the most complete matrix (90% of occupancy), being at odds not only with the sparser but more gene-rich supermatrices (75% and 50% supermatrices) or with the matrices optimizing phylogenegic informativeness and the most conserved genes, but also with previous hypotheses based on morphology, development or other molecular data sets. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of the ever more prevalent quest for completeness in phylogenomic studies.

10.1101/030981,"BackgroundThe availability of whole-genome sequence data from key ancestors provides an exhaustive catalogue of polymorphic sites segregating within and across cattle breeds. Sequence variants from key ancestors can be imputed in animals that have been genotyped using medium- and high-density genotyping arrays. Association analysis with imputed sequences, particularly if applied to multiple traits simultaneously, is a very powerful approach to revealing candidate causal variants underlying complex phenotypes.\n\nResultsWe used whole-genome sequence data from 157 key ancestors of the German Fleckvieh population to impute 20 561 798 sequence variants in 10 363 animals that had (partly imputed) array-derived genotypes at 634 109 SNP. The imputed sequence data were enriched for rare variants. Association studies with imputed sequence variants were performed using seven correlated udder conformation traits as response variables. The calculation of an approximate multi-trait test statistic enabled us to detect twelve major QTL (P<2.97 x 10-9) controlling different aspects of mammary gland morphology. Imputed sequence variants were the most significantly associated at eleven QTL, whereas the top association signal at a QTL on BTA14 resulted from an array-derived variant. Seven QTL were associated with multiple phenotypes. Most QTL were located in non-coding regions of the genome in close neighborhood, however, to plausible candidate genes for mammary gland morphology (SP5, GC, NPFFR2, CRIM1, RXFP2, TBX5, RBM19, ADAM12).\n\nConclusionsAssociation analysis with imputed sequence variants allows QTL characterization at maximum resolution. Multi-trait approaches can reveal QTL that are not detected in single-trait association studies. Most QTL for udder conformation traits were located in non-coding elements of the genome suggesting regulatory mutations to be the major determinants of variation in mammary gland morphology in cattle."
10.1101/031005,"Type 1 interferons such as interferon-alpha (IFN) inhibit replication of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) by upregulating the expression of genes that interfere with specific steps in the viral life cycle. This pathway thus represents a potential target for immune-based therapies that can alter the dynamics of host-virus interactions to benefit the host. To obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how IFN impacts spreading HIV-1 infection, we modeled the interaction of HIV-1 with CD4 T cells and IFN as a dynamical system. This model was then tested using experimental data from a cell culture model of spreading HIV-1 infection. We found that a model in which IFN induces reversible cellular states that block both early and late stages of HIV-1 infection, combined with a saturating rate of conversion to these states, was able to successfully fit the experimental dataset. Sensitivity analysis showed that the potency of inhibition by IFN was particularly dependent on specific network parameters and rate constants. This model will be useful for designing new therapies targeting the IFN network in HIV-1-infected individuals, as well as potentially serving as a template for understanding the interaction of IFN with other viruses.\n\nAuthor SummaryInterferon-alpha (IFN) is a key component of the host response to HIV-1, but the details of how IFN regulates infection are still incompletely understood. To provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of how IFN inhibits HIV-1, we simulated the interaction of IFN and HIV-1 as a computational model and compared this model to an experimental dataset. We identify a model structure that is able to fit many key features of the data. Furthermore, we use the model to predict optimal strategies for targeting the IFN pathway therapeutically. We anticipate that this model will be useful for further analysis of HIV-IFN interactions and will help to guide new therapeutic strategies."
10.1101/030866,"Integrons recombine gene arrays and favor the spread of antibiotic resistance. Their broader roles in bacterial adaptation remain mysterious, partly due to lack of computational tools. We made a program - IntegronFinder - to identify integrons with high accuracy and sensitivity. IntegronFinder is available as a standalone program and as a web application. It searches for attC sites using covariance models, for integron-integrases using HMM profiles, and for other features (promoters, attl site) using pattern matching. We searched for integrons, integron-integrases lacking attC sites, and clusters of attC sites lacking a neighboring integron-integrase in bacterial genomes. All these elements are especially frequent in genomes of intermediate size. They are missing in some key phyla, such as -Proteobacteria, which might reflect selection against cell lineages that acquire integrons. The similarity between attC sites is proportional to the number of cassettes in the integron, and is particularly low in clusters of attC sites lacking integron-integrases. The latter are unexpectedly abundant in genomes lacking integron-integrases or their remains, and have a large novel pool of cassettes lacking homologs in the databases. They might represent an evolutionary step between the acquisition of genes within integrons and their stabilization in the new genome."
10.1101/031039,"Bacteria with two cell membranes (diderms) have evolved complex systems for protein secretion. These systems were extensively studied in some model bacteria, but the characterisation of their diversity has lagged behind due to lack of standard annotation tools. We built models for accurate identification of protein secretion systems and related appendages in bacteria with LPS-containing outer membranes. They can be used with MacSyFinder (standalone program) or online (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::txsscan). They include protein profiles and information on the systems composition and genetic organisation. They can be used to search for T1SS-T6SS, T9SS, and accessorily for flagella, Type IV and Tad pili. We identified ~10,000 systems in bacterial genomes, where T1SS and T5SS were by far the most abundant and widespread. The recently described T6SSiii and T9SS were restricted to Bacteroidetes, and T6SSii to Francisella. T2SS, T3SS, and T4SS were frequently encoded in single-copy in one locus, whereas most T1SS were encoded in two loci. The secretion systems of diderm Firmicutes were similar to those found in other diderms. Novel systems may remain to be discovered, since some clades of environmental bacteria lacked all known protein secretion systems. Our models can be fully customized, which should facilitate the identification of novel systems.Introduction"

10.1101/031062,"Most species are structured and influenced by processes that either increased or reduced gene flow between populations. However, most population genetic inference methods ignore population structure and reconstruct a history characterized by population size changes under the assumption that species behave as panmictic units. This is potentially problematic since population structure can generate spurious signals of population size change. Moreover, when the model assumed for demographic inference is misspecified, genomic data will likely increase the precision of misleading if not meaningless parameters. In a context of model uncertainty (panmixia versus structure) genomic data may thus not necessarily lead to improved statistical inference.\n\nWe consider two haploid genomes and develop a theory which explains why any demographic model (with or without population size changes) will necessarily be interpreted as a series of changes in population size by inference methods ignoring structure. We introduce a new parameter, the IICR (inverse instantaneous coalescence rate), and show that it is equivalent to a population size only in panmictic models, and mostly misleading for structured models. We argue that this general issue affects all population genetics methods ignoring population structure. We take the PSMC method as an example and show that it infers population size changes that never took place. We apply our approach to human genomic data and find a reduction in gene flow at the start of the Pleistocene, a major increase throughout the Middle-Pleistocene, and an abrupt disconnection preceding the emergence of modern humans."
10.1101/030809,"Research collaboration is necessary, rewarding, and beneficial. Cohesion between team members is related to their collective efficiency. To assess collaboration processes and their eventual outcomes, agencies need innovative methods - and social network approaches are emerging as a useful analytical tool. We identified the research output and citation data of a network of 61 research groups formally engaged in publishing rare disease research between 2000 and 2013. We drew the collaboration networks for each year and computed the global and local measures throughout the period, relating connectivity with the normalized impact. Although global network measures remained steady over the whole period, the local and subgroup metrics revealed a growing cohesion between the teams. Transitivity and density showed little or no variation throughout the period. In contrast the following points indicated an evolution towards greater network cohesion: the emergence of a giant component (which grew from just 30% to reach 85% of groups); the decreasing number of communities (following a tripling in the average number of members); the growing number of fully connected subgroups; and increasing average strength. Normalized citation measures, although ranking the member groups as above average impact for Spanish biomedical output, do not support correlation between collaboration and citation impact. The Spanish research network on rare diseases has evolved towards a growing cohesion - as revealed by local and subgroup metrics following social network analysis. This greater cohesion does not translate into a greater impact, as measured by the citation analysis of the papers."

The model calculates chemical gradients and determines the dynamics of the tumor as emergent properties of the interactions between the cells. As an example, we present an investigation of cooperation among cancer cells where cooperators secrete a growth factor that is costly to synthesize. Simulations reveal that cooperation is favored when cancer cells from the same lineage stay in close proximity. The result supports the hypothesis that kin selection, a theory that explains the evolution of cooperation in animals, also applies to cancers."

10.1101/031161,"O_LIEstimates of age-specific mortality are regularly used in ecology, evolution, and conservation research. However, existing methods to estimate mortality from re-sighting records of marked individuals fail at estimating mortality of males for species with male natal dispersal due to the uncertainty surrounding disappearances of adult males from study populations.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we develop a mortality model that imputes dispersal state (i.e., died or left) for uncertain male records as a latent state jointly with the coefficients of a parametric mortality model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. To check the performance of our model, we first conduct a simulation study. We then apply our model to a long-term data set for African lions. Using these data, we further scrutinise the mortality estimates derived from our model by incrementally reducing the level of uncertainty in the male records. We achieve this by taking advantage of an experts intuition on the likely fate of each uncertain male record.\nC_LIO_LIWe find that our new model produces accurate mortality parameters for simulated data of varying sample sizes and proportions of uncertain male records. From the empirical study we learned that our model provides similar mortality estimates for different levels of uncertainty in male records. However, a sensitivity of the mortality estimates to varying uncertainty is, as can be expected, detectable.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that our model provides a solution to the challenge of estimating male mortality in species with data-deficiency for males due to natal dispersal. Given the utility of sex-specific mortality estimates in biological and conservation research and the virtual ubiquity of sex-biased dispersal, our model will be useful to a wide variety of applications.\nC_LI"
10.1101/031096,"Hybridization and polyploidization are considered important driving forces that form new epigenetic regulations. To study the changing patterns of expression accompanying hybridization and polyploidization, we used RNA-seq and qPCR to investigate global expression and homoeologue expression in diploid and allotetraploid hybrids of Carassius auratus red var. ([female]) (R) and Cyprinus carpio ([male]) (C). By comparing the relative expression levels between the hybrids and their parents, we defined the expression level dominance (ELD) and homoeologue expression bias (HEB) in liver tissue. The results showed that polyploidization contributed to the conversion of homoeologue ELD. In addition, hybridization had more effect on the change in HEB than polyploidization, while polyploidization has been considered to have more effect on the change of global gene expression than hybridization. Meanwhile, similar expression patterns were found in growth-related genes. The results suggested that hybridization and polyploidization result in differential degrees of maternal HEB in the three tissues tested. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the underlying regulation mechanism of rapid growth in diploid hybrids and allotetraploids. The differential degrees of global expression and homoeologue expression contribute to growth heterosis in newly formed hybrids and allotetraploids, ensuring the on-going success of allopolyploid speciation."

10.1101/031138,"There is considerable evidence that people with higher levels of the personality trait neuroticism have an increased risk of several types of mental disorder. Higher neuroticism has also been associated, less consistently, with increased risk of various physical health outcomes. We hypothesised that these associations may, in part, be due to shared genetic influences. We tested for pleiotropy between neuroticism and 12 mental and physical diseases or health traits using linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring. Genetic correlations were derived between neuroticism scores in 108 038 people in UK Biobank and health-related measures from 12 large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Summary information for the 12 GWAS was used to create polygenic risk scores for the health-related measures in the UK Biobank participants. Associations between the health-related polygenic scores and neuroticism were examined using regression, adjusting for age, sex, genotyping batch, genotyping array, assessment centre, and population stratification. Genetic correlations were identified between neuroticism and anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.17), major depressive disorder (rg = 0.66) and schizophrenia (rg = 0.21). Polygenic risk for several health-related measures were associated with neuroticism, in a positive direction in the case of bipolar disorder ({beta} = 0.017), major depressive disorder ({beta} = 0.036), schizophrenia ({beta} = 0.036), and coronary artery disease ({beta} = 0.011), and in a negative direction in the case of BMI ({beta} = -0.0095).

10.1101/031146,"When the brain has determined the position of a moving object, due to anatomical and processing delays, the object will have already moved to a new location. Given the statistical regularities present in natural motion, the brain may have acquired compensatory mechanisms to minimize the mismatch between the perceived and the real position of a moving object. A well-known visual illusion -- the flash lag effect -- points towards such a possibility. Although many psychophysical models have been suggested to explain this illusion, their predictions have not been tested at the neural level, particularly in a species of animal known to perceive the illusion. Towards this, we recorded neural responses to flashed and moving bars from primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, fixating macaque monkeys. We found that the response latency to moving bars of varying speed, motion direction and luminance was shorter than that to flashes, in a manner that is consistent with psychophysical results. At the level of V1, our results support the differential latency model positing that flashed and moving bars have different latencies. As we found a neural correlate of the illusion in passively fixating monkeys, our results also suggest that judging the instantaneous position of the moving bar at the time of flash -- as required by the postdiction/motion-biasing model -- may not be necessary for observing a neural correlate of the illusion. Our results also suggest that the brain may have evolved mechanisms to process moving stimuli faster and closer to real time compared with briefly appearing stationary stimuli.\n\nNew and NoteworthyWe report several observations in awake macaque V1 that provide support for the differential latency model of the flash lag illusion. We find that the equal latency of flash and moving stimuli as assumed by motion integration/postdiction models does not hold in V1. We show that in macaque V1, motion processing latency depends on stimulus luminance, speed and motion direction in a manner consistent with several psychophysical properties of the flash lag illusion."

10.1101/031187,"The microbiome is the collection of all microbial genes and can be investigated by sequencing highly variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Evidence suggests that environmental factors and host genetics may interact to impact human microbiome composition. Identifying host genetic variants associated with human microbiome composition not only provides clues for characterizing microbiome variation but also helps to elucidate biological mechanisms of genetic associations, prioritize genetic variants, and improve genetic risk prediction. Since a microbiota functions as a community, it is best characterized by beta diversity, that is, a pairwise distance matrix. We develop a statistical framework and a computationally efficient software package, microbiomeGWAS, for identifying host genetic variants associated with microbiome beta diversity with or without interacting with an environmental factor. We show that score statistics have positive skewness and kurtosis due to the dependent nature of the pairwise data, which makes P-value approximations based on asymptotic distributions unacceptably liberal. By correcting for skewness and kurtosis, we develop accurate P-value approximations, whose accuracy was verified by extensive simulations. We exemplify our methods by analyzing a set of 147 genotyped subjects with 16S rRNA microbiome profiles from non-malignant lung tissues. Correcting for skewness and kurtosis eliminated the dramatic deviation in the quantile-quantile plots. We provided preliminary evidence that six established lung cancer risk SNPs were collectively associated with microbiome composition for both unweighted (P=0.0032) and weighted (P=0.011) UniFrac distance matrices. In summary, our methods will facilitate analyzing large-scale genome-wide association studies of the human microbiome."

We used linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring to test for shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders and physical health. Using information provided by many published genome-wide association study consortia, we created polygenic profile scores for 24 vascular-metabolic, neuropsychiatric, physiological-anthropometric, and cognitive traits in the participants of UK Biobank, a very large population-based sample (N = 112 151). Pleiotropy between cognitive and health traits was quantified by deriving genetic correlations using summary genome-wide association study statistics applied to the method of linkage disequilibrium regression. Substantial and significant genetic correlations were observed between cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many of the mental and physical health-related traits and disorders assessed here. In addition, highly significant associations were observed between the cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many polygenic profile scores, including coronary artery disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder, BMI, intracranial volume, infant head circumference, and childhood cognitive ability. Where disease diagnosis was available for UK Biobank participants we were able to show that these results were not confounded by those who had the relevant disease. These findings indicate that a substantial level of pleiotropy exists between cognitive abilities and many human mental and physical health disorders and traits and that it can be used to predict phenotypic variance across samples."

Here we demonstrate that high intracellular [Formula] enhances currents mediated by the guard cell S-type anion channel SLAC1 when co-expressing either of the protein kinases OST1, CPK6 or CPK23 in Xenopus oocytes. Split-ubiquitin screening identified the PIP2;1 aquaporin as an interactor of the {beta}CA4 carbonic anhydrase, which was confirmed in split luciferase, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. PIP2;1 exhibited CO2 permeability. Co-expression of {beta}CA4 and PIP2;1 with OST1-SLAC1 or CPK6/23-SLAC1 enabled extracellular CO2 enhancement of SLAC1 anion channel activity. An inactive PIP2;1 point mutation was identified which abrogated water and CO2 permeability and extracellular CO2 regulation of SLAC1 activity in Xenopus oocytes. These findings identify the CO2-permeable PIP2;1 aquaporin as key interactor of carbonic anhydrases, show functional reconstitution of extracellular CO2 signaling to ion channel regulation and implicate SLAC1 as a bicarbonate-responsive protein in CO2 regulation of S-type anion channels."

Therefore, efforts in both academia and the private sector have focused on developing alternative workflows that may substantially reduce the computational cost per individual genome. Isaac is an \""ultra-fast\"" variant calling workflow, designed by Illumina, Inc, and is claimed to be six times faster than BWA-GATK, with comparable sensitivity and specificity. This report is an independent review of Isaac, mainly focused on the accuracy of variant calls. We note that Isaac is indeed quite fast, and provide some benchmarks on a few hardware architectures. The overall conclusion from our analysis is that the Isaac workflow has undergone substantial improvement from version 01.14.11.27 to Isaac_2.0. The call accuracy is especially high on NA12878, however exomes tend to have a high fraction of false positive calls. We did not manage to reproduce the 99% sensitivity and specificity reported in the Illumina whitepaper, however that might be improved with further tweaking of the options. This report includes the information about some of the command-line parameters and documentation."
10.1101/031260,"We derive an unbiased information theoretic energy landscape for chromosomes at metaphase using a maximum entropy approach that accurately reproduces the details of the experimentally measured pair-wise contact probabilities between genomic loci. Dynamical simulations using this landscape lead to cylindrical, helically twisted structures reflecting liquid crystalline order. These structures are similar to those arising from a generic ideal homogenized chromosome energy landscape. The helical twist can be either right or left handed so chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously. The ideal chromosome landscape when augmented by interactions like those leading to topologically associating domain (TAD) formation in the interphase chromosome reproduces these behaviors. The phase diagram of this landscape shows the helical fiber order and the cylindrical shape persist at temperatures above the onset of chiral symmetry breaking which is limited by the TAD interaction strength."
10.1101/031278,"Non-canonical RNA motifs help define the vast complexity of RNA structure and function, and in many cases, these loops and junctions are on the order of only 10 nucleotides in size. Unfortunately, despite their small size, there is no reliable method to determine the ensemble of lowest energy structures of junctions and loops at atomic accuracy. This chapter outlines straightforward protocols using a webserver for Rosetta Fragment Assembly of RNA with Full Atom Refinement (FARFAR) (http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/rna_denovo/submit) to model the 3D structure of small non-canonical RNA motifs for use in visualizing motifs and for further refinement or filtering with experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts."
10.1101/031195,"The outcomes of many species interactions are conditional on the environments in which they occur. A common pattern is that outcomes grade from being more positive under stressful conditions to more antagonistic or neutral under benign conditions. The evolutionary implications of conditionality in interactions have received much less attention than the documentation of conditionality itself, with a few notable exceptions. Here, we predict patterns of adaptation and co-adaptation between partners along abiotic gradients, positing that when interactions become more positive in stressful environments, fitness outcomes for mutations affecting interactions align across partners and selection should favor greater mutualistic adap-tation and co-adaptation between interacting species. As a corollary, in benign environments, if interactions are strongly antagonistic, we predict antagonistic co-adaptation resulting in Red Queen or arms-race dynamics, or reduction of antagonism through character displacement and niche partitioning. We predict no adaptation if interactions are more neutral. We call this the CoCoA hypothesis: (Co)-adaptation and Conditionality across Abiotic gradients. We describe experimental designs and statistical models that allow testing predictions of CoCoA, with a focus on positive interactions. While only one study has included all the elements to test CoCoA, we briefly review the literature and summarize study findings relevant to CoCoA and highlight opportunities to test CoCoA further."
10.1101/031302,"BackgroundCellular senescence has historically been viewed as an irreversible cell cycle arrest that acts to prevent cancer. Recent discoveries demonstrated that cellular senescence also played a vital role in normal embryonic development, tissue renewal and senescence-related diseases. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is an important layer of post-transcriptional regulation, which has been found playing an essential role in development, activation of immune cells and cancer progression. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains unclear.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe applied high-throughput paired-end polyadenylation sequencing (PA-seq) and strand-specific RNA-seq sequencing technologies, combined systematic bioinformatics analyses and experimental validation to investigate APA regulation in different passages of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells of rats (VSMCs) with different ages.\n\nResultsBased on PA-seq, we found that genes in senescent cells tended to use distal pA sites and an independent bioinformatics analysis for RNA-seq drew the same conclusion. In consistent with these global results, both the number of genes significantly preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MEFs and VSMCs were significantly higher than genes tended to use proximal pAs. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs tended to decrease, while genes with single pAs did not show such trend. More importantly, genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs were both enriched in common senescence-related pathways, including ubiqutin mediated proteolysis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle and wnt signaling pathway. By cis-elements analyses, we found that the longer 3' UTRs of the genes tended to use distal pAs progressively can introduce more conserved binding sites of senescence-related miRNAs and RBPs. Furthermore, 375 genes with progressive 3' UTR lengthening during MEF senescence tended to use more strong and conserved polyadenylation signal (PAS) around distal pA sites and this was accompanied the observation that expression level of core factors involved in cleavage and polyadenylation complex was decreased.\n\nConclusionsOur finding that genes preferred distal pAs in senescent mouse and rat cells provide new insights for aging cells posttranscriptional gene regulation in the view of alternative polyadenylation given senescence response was thought to be a tumor suppression mechanism and more genes tended to use proximal pAs in cancer cells. In short, APA was a hidden layer of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation involved in cellular senescence."
10.1101/031294,"Systemic chemotherapy is one of the main anticancer treatments used for most kinds of clinically diagnosed tumors. However, the efficacy of these drugs can be hampered by the physical attributes of the tumor tissue that can impede the transport of therapeutic agents to tumor cells in sufficient quantities. As a result, drugs that work well in vitro often fail at clinical trials when confronted with the complexities of interstitial transport within the tumor microenvironment. The microPD model that we developed is used to investigate the penetration of drug molecules through the tumor tissue and influenced by the physical and metabolic properties of tumor microenvironment, and how it affects drug efficacy and the emergence of drug resistance."
10.1101/031179,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a crucial, under-researched crop feeding millions worldwide, especially in Africa. Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has plagued production in Africa for over a century. Bi-parental mapping studies suggest primarily a single major gene mediates resistance. To be certain and to potentially identify new loci we conducted the first genome-wide association mapping study in cassava with 6128 African breeding lines. We also assessed the accuracy of genomic selection to improve CMD resistance. We found a single region on chromosome 8 accounts for most resistance but also identified 13 small effect regions. We found evidence that two epistatic loci and/or alternatively multiple resistance alleles exist at major QTL. We identified two peroxidases and one thioredoxin as candidate genes. Genomic prediction of additive and total genetic merit was accurate for CMD and will be effective both for selecting parents and identifying highly resistant clones as varieties."
10.1101/023747,"Background. Nearly half of the worlds population is at risk for dengue, yet no licensed vaccine or anti-viral drug is currently available. Dengue is caused by any of four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 through DENV-4), and infection by a DENV serotype is assumed to provide life-long protection against re-infection by that serotype. We investigated the validity of this fundamental assumption during a large dengue epidemic caused by DENV-2 in Iquitos, Peru, in 2010-2011, 15 years after the first outbreak of DENV-2 in the region.

Methodology/Principal Findings. We estimated the age-dependent prevalence of serotype-specific DENV antibodies from longitudinal cohort studies conducted between 1993 and 2010. During the 2010-2011 epidemic, active dengue cases were identified through active community- and clinic-based febrile surveillance studies, and acute inapparent DENV infections were identified through contact tracing studies. Based on the age-specific prevalence of DENV-2 neutralizing antibodies, the age distribution of DENV-2 cases was markedly older than expected. Homologous protection was estimated at 35.1% (95% confidence interval: 0% -- 65.2%). At the individual level, pre-existing DENV-2 antibodies were associated with an incomplete reduction in the frequency of symptoms. Among dengue cases, 43% (26/66) exhibited elevated DENV-2 neutralizing antibody titers for years prior to infection, compared with 76% (13/17) of inapparent infections (age-adjusted odds ratio: 4.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 - 17.7).

Conclusions/Significance. Our data indicate that protection from homologous DENV re-infection may be incomplete in some circumstances, which provides context for the limited vaccine efficacy against DENV-2 in recent trials. Further studies are warranted to confirm this phenomenon and to evaluate the potential role of incomplete homologous protection in DENV transmission dynamics.

Author SummaryHomotypic immunity against DENV infection has been assumed to be complete and lifelong, and to our knowledge, instances of homologous DENV re-infection have not been rigorously documented. However, few long-term studies have been conducted in such a way that homologous re-infection could be observed, if it did in fact occur. Our study provides evidence that homologous re-infection may occur in certain circumstances. We draw from data collected during a 2010-2011 DENV-2 epidemic in northeastern Peru, 15 years after the initial DENV-2 outbreak in the region. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of dengue epidemiology and for dengue vaccine formulation, which may need to consider multiple genotypes of each serotype. Data from other long-term dengue epidemiology studies should be analyzed to determine of homologous re-infection is a more widespread phenomenon."
10.1101/031385,"BACKGROUNDRecent advances in transcriptome sequencing have enabled the discovery of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across multitudes of species. Though several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs remain unknown. Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: 1) identifying truly noncoding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and 2) prioritizing hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs from each sample for downstream experimental interrogation.\n\nRESULTSWe present slnckv, a computational lncRNA discovery tool that produces a high-quality set of lncRNAs from RNA-Sequencing data and further prioritizes lncRNAs by characterizing selective constraint as a proxy for function. Our filtering pipeline is comparable to manual curation efforts and more sensitive than previously published approaches. Further, we develop, for the first time, a sensitive alignment pipeline for aligning lncRNA loci and propose new evolutionary metrics relevant for both sequence and transcript evolution. Our analysis reveals that selection acts in several distinct patterns, and uncovers two notable classes of lncRNAs: one showing strong purifying selection at RNA sequence and another where constraint is restricted to the regulation but not the sequence of the transcript.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur novel comparative methods for lncRNAs reveals 233 constrained lncRNAs out of tens of thousands of currently annotated transcripts, which we believe should be prioritized for further interrogation. To aid in their analysis we provide the slncky Evolution Browser as a resource for experimentalists."
10.1101/031419,"BackgroundSequencing of both healthy and disease singletons yields many novel and low frequency variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Complete gene and genome sequencing by next generation sequencing (NGS) significantly increases the number of VUS detected. While prior studies have emphasized protein coding variants, non-coding sequence variants have also been proven to significantly contribute to high penetrance disorders, such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). We present a strategy for analyzing different functional classes of non-coding variants based on information theory (IT).\n\nMethodsWe captured and enriched for coding and non-coding variants in genes known to harbor mutations that increase HBOC risk. Custom oligonucleotide baits spanning the complete coding, non-coding, and intergenic regions 10 kb up- and downstream of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, and TP53 were synthesized for solution hybridization enrichment. Unique and divergent repetitive sequences were sequenced in 102 high-risk patients without identified mutations in BRCA1/2. Aside from protein coding changes, IT-based sequence analysis was used to identify and prioritize pathogenic non-coding variants that occurred within sequence elements predicted to be recognized by proteins or protein complexes involved in mRNA splicing, transcription, and untranslated region (UTR) binding and structure. This approach was supplemented by in silico and laboratory analysis of UTR structure.\n\nResults15,311 unique variants were identified, of which 245 occurred in coding regions. With the unified IT-framework, 132 variants were identified and 87 functionally significant VUS were further prioritized. We also identified 4 stop-gain variants and 3 reading-frame altering exonic insertions/deletions (indels).\n\nConclusionsWe have presented a strategy for complete gene sequence analysis followed by a unified framework for interpreting non-coding variants that may affect gene expression. This approach distills large numbers of variants detected by NGS to a limited set of variants prioritized as potential deleterious changes."
10.1101/031542,"Boolean Integrase Logic gates use phage integrases that respond to transcriptional signals to implement logical functions within living cells via DNA recombination. Control of biological systems using these logic gates has many applications, including biomanufacturing, healthcare, or environmental remediation. Gates are highly sensitive to background transcriptional noise producing unwanted integrase expression and uncontrolled, permanent gate switching. Consequently, connecting gates to novel control signals requires time-consuming directed evolution of regions regulating integrase expression. Here we present an approach in which the activity of an alkane biosensor is tuned to match levels of existing integrase control signals. By adjusting AlkS expression, we tuned the transcriptional output of Palkb to match the output of existing integrase controllers. We successfully connected Palkb to two integrases with different transcriptional control requirements and demonstrated the original logic function was conserved. Our method complements directed evolution approaches to connect Boolean integrate logic gates to novel transcriptional sources and will ultimately facilitate the systematic in silico design of gates responding to various control signals."
10.1101/031484,"Whole-genome low-coverage sequencing has been combined with linkage-disequilibrium (LD) based genotype refinement to accurately and cost-effectively infer genotypes in large cohorts of individuals. Most genotype refinement methods are based on hidden Markov models, which are accurate but computationally expensive. We introduce an algorithm that models LD using a simple multivariate Gaussian distribution. The key feature of our algorithm is its speed, it is hundreds of times faster than other methods on the same data set and its scaling behaviour is linear in the number of samples. We demonstrate the performance of the method on both low-coverage and high-coverage samples.\n\nAvailability: The source code is available at https://github.com/sequencing/marvin\n\nContact: rarthur@illumina.com"
10.1101/031534,"Tumors are typically heterogeneous tissues comprised of multiple cell species in addition to extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and water fluid. It is difficult to model these components at the tissue (10-3-10-2m) scale, where individual cells cannot be represented without prohibitive computational burden. Assuming that same-kind components tend to cluster together, a multiphase approach can be applied to represent heterogeneous tumor tissue at this larger physical scale. This method enables simulating mixture of elements within tissues, e.g., geno-/phenotypic heterogeneity underlying mutation- or microenvironment-driven tumor progression. Further, by not explicitly tracking interfaces, this methodology facilitates realistic modeling of tissue in 3-D."
10.1101/031468,"Custom sequence capture experiments are becoming an efficient approach for gathering large sets of orthologous markers with targeted levels of informativeness in non-model organisms. Transcriptome-based exon capture utilizes transcript sequences to design capture probes, often with the aid of a reference genome to identify intron-exon boundaries and exclude shorter exons (< 200 bp). Here, we test an alternative approach that directly uses transcript sequences for probe design, which are often composed of multiple exons of varying lengths. Based on a selection of 1,260 orthologous transcripts, we conducted sequence captures across multiple phylogenetic scales for frogs, including species up to ~100 million years divergent from the focal group. After several conservative filtering steps, we recovered a large phylogenomic data set consisting of sequence alignments for 1,047 of the 1,260 transcriptome-based loci (~630,000 bp) and a large quantity of highly variable regions flanking the exons in transcripts (~70,000 bp). We recovered high numbers of both shorter (< 100 bp) and longer exons (> 200 bp), with no major reduction in coverage towards the ends of exons. We observed significant differences in the performance of blocking oligos for target enrichment and non-target depletion during captures, and observed differences in PCR duplication rates that can be attributed to the number of individuals pooled for capture reactions. We explicitly tested the effects of phylogenetic distance on capture sensitivity, specificity, and missing data, and provide a baseline estimate of expectations for these metrics based on nuclear pairwise differences among samples. We provide recommendations for transcriptome-based exon capture design based on our results, and describe multiple pipelines for data assembly and analysis."
10.1101/031344,"The prediction of future childs sex is a question of keen public interest. The probability of having a child of either sex is close to 50%, although multiple factors may slightly change this value. Some demographic studies suggested that sex determination can be influenced by previous pregnancies, although this hypothesis was not commonly accepted. This paper explores the correlations between siblings sexes using data from the Demographic and Health Survey program. In the sample of about 2,214,601 women (7,985,855 children), the frequencies of sibships with multiple siblings of the same sex were significantly higher than can be expected by chance. A formal modelling demonstrated that sexes of the children were dependent on three kinds of sex ratio variation: a variation between families (Lexian), a variation within a family (Poisson) and a variation contingent upon the sex of preceding sibling (Markovian). There was a positive correlation between the sexes of successive siblings (coefficient = 0.067, p < 0.001), i.e. a child was more likely to be of the same sex as its preceding sibling. This correlation could be caused by secondary sex ratio adjustment in utero since the effect was decreasing with the length of birth-to-birth interval, and the birth-to-birth interval was longer for siblings with unlike sex."
10.1101/031088,"Light is an essential resource for photosynthesis. Limitation of light by shade from plant neighbors can induce a light competition program known as the shade avoidance response (SAR), thereby altering plant growth and development for the sake of survival. Natural genetic variation in SAR is found in plants adapted to distinct environments, including domesticated tomato Solanum lycopersicum and its wild relative Solanum pennellii. QTL mapping was used to examine variation of the SAR between these two species. We found organ specific responses in the elongation of the stem and petiole, including developmental acceleration of growth. Through RNAseq analysis we identified a number of ILs with reduced expression of auxin-related genes in shade treatment. These same ILs display a shade tolerant phenotype in stem growth and overall height. We also identified ILs with altered SAR expression of cell wall expansion genes, although these genotypes had no accompanying alteration in phenotype. Examination of weighted gene co-expression Connectivity networks in sun- and shade-treated plants revealed Connectivity changes in auxin and light signaling genes; this result was supported by the Identification of motifs within the promoters of a subset of shade-responsive genes that were enriched in light signaling, developmental pathways, and auxin responsive transcriptional domains. The Identification ofboth systemic and organ-specific shade tolerance in the ILs, as well as associated changes in the transcriptome, has the potential to inform future studies for breeding plants able to be grown closely (while neighbor-shaded), yet still maintaining high yield.\n\nSummaryGrowth plasticity in response to shade involves expression of specific auxin signaling and cell wall expansion genes, and shade avoidance QTL affect both stem elongation and developmental rate."
10.1101/031500,"Abstract.Pairwise sequence alignment is perhaps the most fundamental bioinformatics operation. An optimal global alignment algorithm was described in 1970 by Needleman and Wunsch. In 1982 Gotoh presented an improved algorithm with lower time complexity. Gotohs algorithm is frequently cited (1447 citations, Google Scholar, May 2015), taught and, most importantly, used as well as implemented. While implementing the algorithm, we discovered two mathematical mistakes in Gotohs paper that induce sub-optimal sequence alignments. First, there are minor indexing mistakes in the dynamic programming algorithm which become apparent immediately when implementing the procedure. Hence, we report on these for the sake of completeness. Second, there is a more profound problem with the dynamic programming matrix initialization. This initialization issue can easily be missed and find its way into actual implementations. This error is also present in standard text books. Namely, the widely used books by Gusfield and Waterman. To obtain an initial estimate of the extent to which this error has been propagated, we scrutinized freely available undergraduate lecture slides. We found that 8 out of 31 lecture slides contained the mistake, while 16 out of 31 simply omit parts of the initialization, thus giving an incomplete description of the algorithm. Finally, by inspecting ten source codes and running respective tests, we found that five implementations were incorrect. Note that, not all bugs we identified are due to the mistake in Gotohs paper. Three implementations rely on additional constraints that limit generality. Thus, only two out of ten yield correct results. We show that the error introduced by Gotoh is straightforward to resolve and provide a correct open-source reference implementation. We do believe though, that raising the awareness about these errors is critical, since the impact of incorrect pairwise sequence alignments that typically represent one of the very first stages in any bioinformatics data analysis pipeline can have a detrimental impact on downstream analyses such as multiple sequence alignment, orthology assignment, phylogenetic analyses, divergence time estimates, etc."
10.1101/031328,"Natural selection may often favor coordination between different traits, or phenotypic integration, in order to most efficiently acquire and deploy scarce resources. As leaves are the primary photosynthetic organ in plants, many have proposed that leaf physiology, biochemistry, and anatomical structure are coordinated along a functional trait spectrum from fast, resource-acquisitive syndromes to slow, resource-conservative syndromes. However, the coordination hypothesis has rarely been tested at a phylogenetic scale most relevant for understanding rapid adaptation in the recent past or predicting evolutionary trajectories in response to climate change. To that end, we used a common garden to examine genetically-based coordination between leaf traits across 19 wild and cultivated tomato taxa. We found surprisingly weak integration between photosynthetic rate, leaf structure, biochemical capacity, and CO2 diffusion, even though all were arrayed in the predicted direction along a  fast-slow spectrum. This suggests considerable scope for unique trait combinations to evolve in response to new environments or in crop breeding. In particular, we find that partially independent variation in stomatal and mesophyll conductance may allow a plant to improve water-use efficiency without necessarily sacrificing maximum photosynthetic rates. Our study does not imply that functional trait spectra or tradeoffs are unimportant, but that the many important axes of variation within a taxonomic group may be unique and not generalizable to other taxa."
10.1101/031427,"The observation that variants regulating gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL) are at a high frequency among SNPs associated with complex traits has made the genome-wide characterization of gene expression an important tool in genetic mapping studies of such traits. As part of a study to identify genetic loci contributing to bipolar disorder and a wide range of BP-related quantitative traits in members of 26 pedigrees from Costa Rica and Colombia, we measured gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 786 pedigree members. The study design enabled us to comprehensively reconstruct the genetic regulatory network in these families, provide estimates of heritability, identify eQTL, evaluate missing heritability for the eQTL, and quantify the number of different alleles contributing to any given locus."
10.1101/031518,"A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome.1 Null mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such  human knockouts can provide insight into gene function. To date, comprehensive analysis of genes knocked out in humans has been limited by the fact that null mutations are infrequent in the general population and so, observing an individual homozygous null for a given gene is exceedingly rare.2,3 However, consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring who carry homozygous null mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high.4 Here, we sequenced the protein-coding regions of 7,078 adult participants living in Pakistan and performed phenotypic analysis to identify homozygous null individuals and to understand consequences of complete gene disruption in humans. We enumerated 36,850 rare (<1 % minor allele frequency) null mutations. These homozygous null mutations led to complete inactivation of 961 genes in at least one participant. Homozygosity for null mutations at APOC3 was associated with absent plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels; at PLAG27, with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; and at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations. After physiologic challenge with oral fat, APOC3 knockouts displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides compared to wild-type family members. These observations provide a roadmap to understand the consequences of complete disruption of a large fraction of genes in the human genome."
10.1101/031286,"The last 20 years of advancement in DNA sequencing technologies have led to the sequencing of thousands of microbial genomes, creating mountains of genetic data. While our efficiency in generating the data improves almost daily, applying meaningful relationships between the taxonomic and genetic entities requires a new approach. Currently, the knowledge is distributed across a fragmented landscape of resources from government-funded institutions such as NCBI and Uniprot to topic-focused databases like the ODB3 database of prokaryotic operons, to the supplemental table of a primary publication. A major drawback to large scale, expert curated databases is the expense of maintaining and extending them over time. No entity apart from a major institution with stable long-term funding can consider this, and their scope is limited considering the magnitude of microbial data being generated daily. Wikidata is an, openly editable, semantic web compatible framework for knowledge representation. Its a project of the Wikimedia Foundation and offers knowledge integration capabilities ideally suited to the challenge of representing the exploding body of information about microbial genomics. We are developing a microbial specific data model, based on Wikidatas semantic web compatibility, that represents bacterial species, strains and the gene and gene products that define them. Currently, we have loaded 1736 gene items and 1741 protein items for two strains of the human pathogenic bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis and used this subset of data as an example of the empowering utility of this model. In our next phase of development we will expand by adding another 118 bacterial genomes and their gene and gene products, totaling over ~900,000 additional entities. This aggregation of knowledge will be a platform for community-driven collaboration, allowing the networking of microbial genetic data through the sharing of knowledge by both the data and domain expert."
10.1101/031443,"The capacity to map traits over large cohorts of individuals - phenomics - lags far behind the explosive development in genomics. For microbes the estimation of growth is the key phenotype. We introduce an automated microbial phenomics framework that delivers accurate and highly resolved growth phenotypes at an unprecedented scale.

Our prototype arrangement automatically records and analyses 100,000 experiments in parallel. We demonstrate the power of the approach by extending and nuancing the known salt defence biology in bakers yeast. The introduced framework will have a transformative impact by providing high-quality microbial phenomics data for extensive cohorts of individuals and generating well-populated and standardized phenomics databases."
10.1101/031336,"The assembly of the first centrosome occurs upon fertilisation when the male centrioles recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) from the egg cytoplasm. While inaccuracy in the assembly of centrosomes leads to infertility and abnormal embryogenesis, the mechanism that ensures accurate assembly in vertebrate embryos remains obscure. Here we applied a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout to show that Wdr8, a novel centrosomal protein, is maternally essential for PCM assembly during embryonic mitoses of medaka (Oryzias latipes). Maternal/zygotic Wdr8-null (Wdr8-/-) blastomeres exhibit severe defects in PCM assembly that cause them to divide asymmetrically and develop multipolar mitotic spindles and aneuploidy. We demonstrate that Wdr8 interacts via its WD40 domains with the centriolar satellite protein SSX2IP. Strikingly, exogenously provided Wdr8 fully rescues Wdr8-/- embryos to adulthood, except in variants with mutations in the WD40 domains. This combination of targeted gene inactivation and in vivo reconstitution of the maternally essential Wdr8-SSX2IP complex reveals an essential link between maternal PCM and the stability of the zygotic genome in the early vertebrate embryo."
10.1101/031476,"The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects terrestrial inputs on aquatic microbial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active microbial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies microbial community stability through functional not structural changes. Together, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning."
10.1101/031351,"Background: Mixed dispersal syndromes have historically been regarded as bet-hedging mechanisms that enhance survival in unpredictable environments, ensuring that some propagules stay in the maternal environment while others can potentially colonize new sites. However, this entails paying the costs of both dispersal and non-dispersal. Propagules that disperse are likely to encounter unfavorable conditions for establishment, while non-dispersing propagules might form populations of close relatives burdened with inbreeding. Here, we investigate the conditions under which mixed dispersal syndromes emerge and are evolutionarily stable, taking into account the risks of both environmental unpredictability and inbreeding.\n\nResults: Using mathematical and computational modeling we show that high dispersal propensity is favored whenever temporal environmental unpredictability is low and inbreeding depression high, whereas mixed dispersal syndromes are adaptive under conditions of high environmental unpredictability, but more particularly if also inbreeding depression is small. Although pure dispersers can be selected for under some circumstances, mixed dispersal provides the optimal strategy under most parameterizations of our models, indicating that this strategy is likely to be favored under a wide variety of conditions. Furthermore, populations exhibiting any single phenotype go inevitably extinct when environmental and genetic costs are high, whilst mixed strategies can maintain viable populations even under such conditions.\n\nConclusions: Our models support the hypothesis that the interplay between inbreeding depression and environmental unpredictability shapes dispersal syndromes, often resulting in mixed strategies. Moreover, mixed dispersal seems to facilitate persistence whenever conditions are critical or nearly critical for survival."
10.1101/031393,"Ash dieback due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is threatening the Fraxinus excelsior species in most of its natural range in Europe and it is becoming obvious that other species in the Fraxinus genus are susceptible to the disease. The fungal pathogen apparently originates from Asia where it may act as an endophyte of local species like F. mandshurica. Previous studies reported significant levels of genetic variability for susceptibility in F. excelsior either in field or inoculation experiments. The present study was based on a field experiment planted in 1995, fifteen years before onset of the disease. Crown and collar status were monitored on 788 trees from 23 open-pollinated progenies originating from 3 French provenances. Susceptibility was modelled using a Bayesian approach where spatio-temporal effects were explicitly taken into account, thus providing accurate narrow-sense heritability estimates (h2). While moderate narrow-sense heritability estimates for Crown Dieback (CD, h2 = 0.42 in this study) have already been reported in the literature, this study is first to show that Collar Lesions are also heritable (h2 = 0.49 for prevalence and h2 = 0.42 for severity) and that there is significant genetic correlation between the severities of both traits (rspearman=0.40). Unexpectedly, their spatio-temporal dynamics followed almost opposite patterns. While no significant Provenance effect were detected for any trait, significant Family effects were found for both CD and CL. Moreover, the analysis strategy implemented here allowed to compute Individual Breeding Values (IBV) and to show that there is more genetic variability within families than between families. In agreement with previous reports, early flushing correlates with better crown status. Consequences of these results in terms of management and breeding are discussed."
10.1101/031609,"Bacteriorhodopsin, a light activated protein that creates a proton gradient in halobacteria, has long served as a simple model of proton pumps. Within bacteriorhodopsin, several key sites undergo protonation changes during the photocycle, moving protons from the higher pH cytoplasm to the lower pH extracellular side. The mechanism underlying the long-range proton translocation between the central (the retinal Schiff base SB216, D85 and D212) and exit clusters (E194 and E204) remains elusive. To obtain a dynamic view of the key factors controlling proton translocation, a systematic study using molecular dynamics simulation was performed for eight bacteriorhodopsin models varying in retinal isomer and protonation of the SB216, D85, D212 and E204. The side-chain orientation of R82 is determined primarily by the protonation states of the residues in the EC. The side-chain reorientation of R82 modulates the hydrogen-bond network and consequently possible pathways of proton transfer. Quantum mechanical intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations of proton-transfer in the methyl guanidinium-hydronium-hydroxide model system show that proton transfer via a guanidinium group requires an initial geometry permitting proton donation and acceptance by the same amine. In all the models, R82 can form proton wires with both the CC and the EC connected by the same amine. Alternatively, rare proton wires for proton transfer from the CC to the EC without involving R82 were found in an O state where the proton on D85 is transferred to D212."
10.1101/031575,"Across western North America, Mimulus guttatus exists as many local populations adapted to site-specific challenges including salt spray, temperature, water availability, and soil chemistry. Gene flow between locally adapted populations will effect genetic diversity in both local demes and across the larger meta-population. A single population of annual M. guttatus from Iron Mountain, Oregon (IM) has been extensively studied and we here building off this research by analyzing whole genome sequences from 34 inbred lines from IM in conjunction with sequences from 22 Mimulus individuals from across the geographic range. Three striking features of these data address hypotheses about migration and selection in a locally adapted population. First, we find very high intra-population polymorphism (synonymous {pi} = 0.033). Variation outside genes may be even higher, but is difficult to estimate because excessive divergence affects read mapping. Second, IM exhibits a significantly positive genome-wide average for Tajimas D. This indicates allele frequencies are typically more intermediate than expected from neutrality, opposite the pattern observed in other species. Third, IM exhibits a distinctive haplotype structure. There is a genome-wide excess of positive associations between minor alleles; consistent with an important effect of gene flow from nearby Mimulus populations. The combination of multiple data types, including a novel, tree-based analytic method and estimates for structural polymorphism (inversions) from previous genetic mapping studies, illustrates how the balance of strong local selection, limited dispersal, and meta-population dynamics manifests across the genome."

10.1101/031633,"O_LIPairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and on-going dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework.\nC_LIO_LIWe used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae).\nC_LIO_LISimulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as Fst) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of Fst was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise Fst. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.\nC_LI"
10.1101/031666,"Genetic diversity is shaped by the interaction of drift and selection, but the details of this interaction are not well understood. The impact of genetic drift in a population is largely determined by its demographic history, typically summarized by its long-term effective population size (Ne). Rapidly changing population demographics complicate this relationship, however. To better understand how changing demography impacts selection, we used whole-genome sequencing data to investigate patterns of linked selection in domesticated and wild maize (teosinte). We produce the first whole-genome estimate of the demography of maize domestication, showing that maize was reduced to approximately 5% the population size of teosinte before it experienced rapid expansion post-domestication to population sizes much larger than its ancestor. Evaluation of patterns of nucleotide diversity in and near genes shows little evidence of selection on beneficial amino acid substitutions, and that the domestication bottleneck led to a decline in the efficiency of purifying selection in maize. Young alleles, however, show evidence of much stronger purifying selection in maize, reflecting the much larger effective size of present day populations. Our results demonstrate that recent demographic change -- a hallmark of many species including both humans and crops -- can have immediate and wide-ranging impacts on diversity that conflict with would-be expectations based on Ne alone."
10.1101/031625,"RNA sequencing protocols allow for quantifying gene expression regulation at each individual step, from transcription to protein synthesis. Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome. Despite its great potential, a rigorous statistical approach to identify translated regions by means of the characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity of Ribo-seq data is not yet available. To fill this gap, we developed RiboTaper, which quantifies the significance of periodic Ribo-seq reads via spectral analysis methods.\n\nWe applied RiboTaper on newly generated, deep Ribo-seq data in HEK293 cells, to derive an extensive map of translation that covers Open Reading Frame (ORF) annotations for more than 11,000 protein-coding genes. We also find distinct ribosomal signatures for several hundred detected upstream ORFs and ORFs in annotated non-coding genes (ncORFs). Mass spectrometry data confirms that RiboTaper achieves excellent coverage of the cellular proteome and validates dozens of novel peptide products. Collectively, RiboTaper (available at https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/) is a powerful method for comprehensive de novo identification of actively used ORFs in the human genome."
10.1101/031617,"Accurate annotation of protein coding regions is essential for understanding how genetic information is translated into biological functions. Here we describe riboHMM, a new method that uses ribosome footprint data along with gene expression and sequence information to accurately infer translated sequences. We applied our method to human lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 7,273 previously unannotated coding sequences, including 2,442 translated upstream open reading frames. We observed an enrichment of harringtonine-treated ribosome footprints at the inferred initiation sites, validating many of the novel coding sequences. The novel sequences exhibit significant signatures of selective constraint in the reading frames of the inferred proteins, suggesting that many of these are functional. Nearly 40% of bicistronic transcripts showed significant negative correlation in the levels of translation of their two coding sequences, suggesting a key regulatory role for these novel translated sequences. Our work significantly expands the set of known coding regions in humans."
10.1101/031781,"In a classic example of the invasion of a species by a selfish genetic element, the P-element was horizontally transferred from a distantly related species into Drosophila melanogaster. Despite causing  hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes that include sterility, the P-element spread globally in the course of a few decades in D. melanogaster. Until recently, its sister species, including D. simulans, remained P-element free. Here, we find a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years; a survey of 181 strains shows that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. To characterize this invasion temporally and geographically, we survey 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. We find that the D. simulans P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element.\n\nAuthor SummarySome genes perform necessary organismal functions, others hijack the cellular machinery to replicate themselves, potentially harming the host in the process. These  selfish genes can spread through genomes and species; as a result, eukaryotic genomes are typically saddled with large amounts of parasitic DNA. Here, we chronicle the surprisingly rapid global spread of a selfish transposable element through a close relative of the genetic model, Drosophila melanogaster. We see that, as it spreads, the transposable element is associated with damaging effects, including sterility, but that the flies quickly adapt to the negative consequences of the transposable element."

10.1101/031724,"MotivationAccurate identification of genotypes is critical in identifying de novo mutations, linking mutations with disease, and determining mutation rates. Because de novo mutations are rare, even low levels of genotyping error can cause a large fraction of false positive de novo mutations. Biological and technical processes that adversely affect genotyping include copy-number-variation, paralogous sequences, library preparation, sequencing error, and reference-mapping biases, among others.\n\nResultsWe modeled the read depth for all data as a mixture of Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, resulting in significant improvements over previously used models. In most cases the best model was comprised of two distributions. The major-component distribution is similar to a binomial distribution with low error and low reference bias. The minor-component distribution is overdispersed with higher error and reference bias. We also found that sites fitting the minor component are enriched for copy number variants and low complexity region. We expect that this approach to modeling the distribution of NGS data, will lead to improved genotyping. For example, this approach provides an expected distribution of reads that can be incorporated into a model to estimate de novo mutations using reads across a pedigree.\n\nAvailabilityMethods and data files are available at https://github.com/CartwrightLab/WuEtAl2016/.\n\nContactcartwright@asu.edu"

Based on depletion of rhLOF genotypes, we estimate that 13.6% of knockouts are incompatible with adult life, finding on average 1.6 heterozygous recessive lethal LOF variants per adult. Linking to lifelong health records, we observed no association of rhLOF genotypes with prescription- or doctor-consultation rate, and no disease-related phenotypes in 33 of 42 individuals with rhLOF genotypes in recessive Mendelian disease genes.

These methods belong to a broad class of mixed-membership models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation used to analyze text corpora. Inference from mixed-membership models can produce different output matrices when repeatedly applied to the same inputs, and the number of latent clusters is a parameter that is often varied in the analysis pipeline. For these reasons, quantifying, visualizing, and annotating the output from mixed-membership models are bottlenecks for investigators across multiple disciplines from ecology to text data mining.\n\n2 ResultsWe introduce pong, a network-graphical approach for analyzing and visualizing membership in latent clusters with a native D3.js interactive visualization. pong leverages efficient algorithms for solving the Assignment Problem to dramatically reduce runtime while increasing accuracy compared to other methods that process output from mixed-membership models.

10.1101/031807,"Insulin is an ancient, multi-functional hormone with essential roles in glucose homeostasis and energy storage. Recently, our group has taken advantage of the ability to limit insulin secretion in vivo by reducing insulin gene dosage to demonstrate that insulin hypersecretion is a requirement for diet-induced obesity. Our previous studies employed male Ins1+/-:Ins2-/- mice that exhibit a complete inhibition of diet-induced hyperinsulinemia relative to Ins1+/+:Ins2-/- littermate controls, as well as female Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice with transient, partial reduction in circulating insulin relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates. In the present study, we sought to extend these studies to male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice on the same chow and high fat diets. Surprisingly, while reduced Ins2 gene dosage appeared capable of reducing Ins2 mRNA, insulin protein levels in these mice were not significantly reduced. Moreover, there was a marked hyper-variability in circulating insulin levels within and between two independent cohorts of mice that persisted over at least the first year of life. In Cohort 1, we observed a paradoxical increase in body weight in some high fat-fed male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice relative to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermate controls. This phenomenon is consistent with the known satiety effects of insulin and our previous observations with Ins2 can be expressed in the brain. Collectively, our data reveal unexpected complexity associated with the Ins2 gene in male mice, and establish the Ins2 gene as a candidate for studying the effects of modifier genes and/or environmental influences on gene-to-phenotype variability. Further studies are required to define the molecular mechanisms of this phenotypic hyper-variability and to define the role of reduced Ins2 gene dosage in the brain."
10.1101/031716,"The discovery of shared behavioral processes across phyla is an essential step in the establishment of a comparative study of behavior. We use immobility as an origin and reference for the measurement of locomotor behavior; speed, direction of walking and direction of facing as the three degrees of freedom shaping fly locomotor behavior; and cocaine as the parameter inducing a progressive transition in and out of immobility. In this way we expose and quantify the generative rules that shape part of fruit fly locomotor behavior, bringing about a gradual buildup of freedom during the transition from immobility to normal behavior and a precisely opposite narrowing down during the transition into immobility. During buildup the fly exhibits enhancement and then reduction to normal values of movement along each degree of freedom: first, body rotation in the horizontal plane, then path curvature and then speed of translation. Transition into immobility unfolds by narrowing down of the repertoire in the opposite sequential order, showing reciprocal relations during both buildup and narrowing down. The same generative rules apply to vertebrate locomotor behavior in a variety of contexts involving transition out and into immobility. Recent claims for deep homology between the arthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia provide an opportunity to examine whether the generative rules we discovered also share common descent. Neurochemical processes mediating the buildup of locomotor behavior in vertebrates could guide the search for equivalent processes in arthropods. The measurement methodology we use prompts the discovery of candidate behavioral homologies.\n\nSignificance StatementDo flies and mice share the same behavior? By defining immobility as an intrinsic reference point for locomotor behavior we show that the rules that generate the transition from immobility to full blown normal behavior, and from full blown behavior to immobility are shared by fruit flies and mice. These rules constitute a much desired aim of evolutionary biology: the discovery of behavioral homologies across distant phyla. The methodology we use facilitates the discovery of cross-phyletic behavioral homologies, shedding light on the problem of the evolution of behavior."

10.1101/031740,"Much work has been devoted to understanding the evolutionary processes shaping genetic variation across genomes. Studies have found neutral polymorphism is reduced close to genes and in regions of low recombination, suggesting the effects of natural selection. However, the effect of selection on neutral sequence divergence between species remains ambiguous. While studies have reported correlations between divergence and recombination, theoretical arguments suggest selection may not affect divergence at linked neutral sites. Here we address these outstanding issues by examining how natural selection has affected divergence between distantly related species. We show that neutral divergence is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist even when comparing humans and mice, species that split 75 million years ago. Further, neutral divergence is positively correlated with recombination rate. The correlation increases when focusing on genic regions, and biased gene conversion cannot explain all of this correlation. These signatures suggest that natural selection has affected linked divergence between distantly related species. Coalescent models indicate that background selection can generate these patterns. Even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome. Thus, the view that selection does not affect divergence at linked neutral sites needs to be reconsidered. Our work has important implications for understanding evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation."
10.1101/031757,"We present the Metagenomic Intra-species Diversity Analysis System (MIDAS), which is an integrated computational pipeline for quantifying bacterial species abundance and strain-level genomic variation, including gene content and single nucleotide polymorphisms, from shotgun metagenomes. Our method leverages a database of >30,000 bacterial reference genomes which we clustered into species groups. These cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but only a small proportion of microbes in other environments, including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare single nucleotide variants to reveal extensive vertical transmission of strains at birth but colonization with strains unlikely to derive from the mother at later time points. This pattern was missed with species-level analysis, because the infant gut microbiome composition converges towards that of an adult over time. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data is analyzed at a higher taxonomic resolution."
10.1101/031765,"AbstractHow does cortical state affect neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, and is it analogous between anesthetized and awake animals? We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from all layers of isoflurane-anesthetized cat primary visual cortex (V1) while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses of single units were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, with lognormally distributed mean firing rates. Many units had distinct barcode-like firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Because the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced, our results complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. The presenceof orientation maps in cat V1 may explain contrary reports in anesthetized rodents, and predicts a similar result in anesthetized ferret and primate V1.\n\nSignificance StatementGlobal brain activity changes spontaneously over time and can be characterized along a spectrum from slow synchronized activity, to fast desynchronized activity. This spectrum is similar in awake, asleep and anesthetized animals, but is its effect on neural responses the same in all cases? Here we show that neural responses to natural movies in anesthetized cat visual cortex are more precise during synchronized activity. This is contrary to reports in anesthetized rodents, which we suggest may be due to greater columnar organization in cat visual cortex. Since this is also contrary to enhanced responses and behavioural performance during attention, when activity is desynchronized, our results suggest that similar brain states in awake and anesthetized animals may not be functionally analogous."
10.1101/031799,"Insulin is an essential hormone with key roles in energy homeostasis and body composition. Mice and rats, unlike other mammals, have two insulin genes: the rodent-specific Ins1 gene and the ancestral Ins2 gene. The relationships between insulin gene dosage and obesity has previously been explored in male and female Ins2-/- mice with full or reduced Ins1 dosage, as well as in female Ins1-/- mice with full or partial Ins2 dosage. We report herein unexpected hyper-variability in circulating insulin and physiological responses to high fat feeding in male Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice. Two large cohorts of Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice and their Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates were fed chow diet or high fat diet (HFD) from weaning and housed in specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Cohort A and cohort B were studied one year apart. Contrary to female mice from the same litters, inactivating one Ins2 allele on the complete Ins1-null background did not cause a consistent reduction of circulating insulin in male mice. In cohort A, HFD-fed males showed an equivalent degree of insulin hypersecretion and weight gain, regardless of Ins2 dosage. In cohort B, Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- males showed decreased insulin levels and body mass, compared to Ins1-/-:Ins2+/+ littermates. While experimental conditions were held consistent between cohorts, we found that HFD-fed Ins1-/-:Ins2+/- mice with lower insulin levels had increased corticosterone. Collectively, these observations highlight the hyper-variability and range of phenotypic characteristics modulated by Ins2 gene dosage, specifically in male mice."
10.1101/031773,"Rapid control of adhesive forces is one of the key benchmarks where footpads of climbing animals outperform conventional adhesives, promising novel bio-inspired attachment systems. All climbing animals use shear forces to switch rapidly between firm attachment and easy detachment, but the detailed mechanisms underlying  shear-sensitive adhesion have remained unclear. Here, we show that attachment forces of stick insects follow classic peeling theory when shear forces are small, but strongly exceed predictions as soon as their pads start to slide due to high shear forces. Pad sliding dramatically increases the critical peel force via a combination of two distinct mechanisms. First, partial sliding will pre-stretch the pads, so that they are effectively stiffer upon detachment and peel increasingly like inextensible tape. We demonstrate how this effect can be directly related to peeling theories which account for frictional dissipation. Second, pad sliding reduces the thickness of the secretion layer in the contact zone, thereby decreasing the interfacial mobility, and increasing the stress levels required for peeling. The approximately linear increase of adhesion with friction results in a sharp increase of adhesion at peel angles less than ca. 30{degrees}, allowing rapid switching between attachment and detachment during locomotion. Our results may apply to diverse climbing animals independent of pad morphology and adhesive mechanism, and highlight that control of adhesion is not solely achieved by direction-dependence and morphological anisotropy, suggesting promising new routes for the development of bio-inspired adhesives."
10.1101/031591,"One of the goals of relation extraction is to identify protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in biomedical literature. Current systems are capturing binary relations and also the direction and type of an interaction. Besides assisting in the curation PPIs into databases, there has been little real-world application of these algorithms. We describe UPSITE, a text mining tool for extracting evidence in support of a hypothesized interaction. Given a predicted PPI, UPSITE uses a binary relation detector to check whether a PPI is found in abstracts in PubMed. If it is not found, UPSITE retrieves documents relevant to each of the two proteins separately, and extracts contextual information about biological events surrounding each protein, and calculates semantic similarity of the two proteins to provide evidential support for the predicted PPI. In evaluations, relation extraction achieved an Fscore of 0.88 on the HPRD50 corpus, and semantic similarity measured with angular distance was found to be statistically significant. With the development of PPI prediction algorithms, the burden of interpreting the validity and relevance of novel PPIs is on biologists. We suggest that presenting annotations of the two proteins in a PPI side-by-side and a score that quantifies their similarity lessens this burden to some extent."
10.1101/031674,"Analysis of previously unpublished allele counts obtained from the French-San-Neanderthal-Chimpanzee alignment of the high quality DNA sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains raises significant questions about the currently accepted phylogenetic model of the origins of Europeans. Previous estimates of the proportion of Neanderthal ancestry in present-day Europeans ranged between 1.3% and 2.7% supporting a recent Out-of Africa dispersal model followed by a low level of admixture with Neanderthals. However, analysis of the allele counts indicates the existence of an unidentified third archaic ancestor of Europeans, which diverged from its common ancestor with sub-Saharan Africans around 900 thousand years ago. This analysis shows that the relative proportions of derived alleles in the 0.0826% of the European genome that is not shared with the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzee are 13.6% Neanderthal, 32.3% sub-Saharan African and 54.2% third archaic ancestor. This analysis together with anthropological and archaeological evidence suggests a new model of human dispersal based on a Eurasian lineage in the Levant, which admixed with Neanderthals and descendants of African mtDNA haplogroup L3, followed by radiation from a basal admixed population around 55-50 Kya, with no subsequent major contribution to the European genome."
10.1101/031831,"The genetic structure of human populations is often characterized by aggregating measures of ancestry across the autosomal chromosomes. While it may be reasonable to assume that population structure patterns are similar genome-wide in relatively homogeneous populations, this assumption may not be appropriate for admixed populations, such as Hispanics and African Americans, with recent ancestry from two or more continents. Recent studies have suggested that systematic ancestry differences can arise at genomic locations in admixed populations as a result of selection and non-random mating. Here, we propose a method, which we refer to as the chromosomal ancestry differences (CAnD) test, for detecting heterogeneity in population structure across the genome. CAnD uses local ancestry inferred from SNP genotype data to identify chromosomes harboring genomic regions with ancestry contributions that are significantly different than expected. In simulation studies with real genotype data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate the validity and power of CAnD. We apply CAnD to the HapMap Mexican American (MXL) and African American (ASW) population samples; in this analysis the software RFMix is used to infer local ancestry at genomic regions assuming admixing from Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans. The CAnD test provides strong evidence of heterogeneity in population structure across the genome in the MXL sample (p = 4e - 05), which is largely driven by elevated Native American ancestry and deficit of European ancestry on the X chromosomes. Among the ASW, all chromosomes are largely African derived and no heterogeneity in population structure is detected in this sample."
10.1101/031849,"Poison frogs sequester chemical defenses from arthropod prey, although the details of how arthropod diversity contributes to variation in poison frog toxins remains unclear. We characterized skin alkaloid profiles in the Little Devil frog, Oophaga sylvatica (Dendrobatidae), across three populations in northwestern Ecuador. Using gas chromatography mass spectrometry, we identified histrionicotoxins, 3,5- and 5,8-disubstituted indolizidines, decahydroquinolines, and lehmizidines as the primary alkaloid toxins in these O. sylvatica populations. Frog skin alkaloid composition varied along a latitudinal gradient across populations in a principal component analysis. We also characterized diversity in arthropods isolated from frog stomach contents and confirmed O. sylvatica specialize on ants and mites. To test the hypothesis that poison frog toxin diversity reflects species and chemical diversity in arthropod prey, we (1) used liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to chemically profile consumed ants and mites, and (2) used sequencing of cytochrome oxidase 1 to identify individual prey specimens. We show that chemical profiles of consumed ants and mites cluster by frog population, suggesting different frog populations have access to chemically distinct prey. We identified 45 ants and 9 mites isolated from frog stomachs, finding several undescribed species. Finally, by comparing chemical profiles of frog skin and isolated prey items, we were able to trace the arthropod source of four poison frog alkaloids, including 3,5- and 5,8-disubstituted indolizidines and a lehmizidine alkaloid.

A family of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) which emerged to be important during development and in adult neurons is the one of Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding proteins (CPEBs). Drosophila Orb2 (homolog of vertebrate CPEB2 protein and of the neural isoform of Aplysia CPEB) has been found to be involved in the translation of plasticity-dependent mRNAs and has been associated to Long Term Memory (LTM). Orb2 protein presents two main isoforms, Orb2A and Orb2B, which form an activity induced amyloid-like functional aggregate, which is thought to be the translation-inducing state of the RBP. Here we present a two-states continuous differential model for Orb2A-Orb2B aggregation and we propose it, more generally, as a new synaptic facilitation rule for learning processes involving protein aggregation-dependent plasticity (PADP)."
10.1101/031872,"Blindness has evolved repeatedly in cave-dwelling organisms, and investigating the loss of sight in cave dwellers presents an opportunity to understand the operation of fundamental evolutionary processes, including drift, selection, mutation, and migration. The observation of blind organisms has prompted many hypotheses for their blindness, including both accumulation of neutral, loss-of-function mutations and adaptation to darkness. Here we model the evolution of blindness in caves. This model captures the interaction of three forces: (1) selection favoring alleles causing blindness, (2) immigration of sightedness alleles from a surface population, and (3) loss-of-function mutations creating blindness alleles. We investigated the dynamics of this model and determined selection-strength thresholds that result in blindness evolving in caves despite immigration of sightedness alleles from the surface. Our results indicate that strong selection is required for the evolution of blindness in cave-dwelling organisms, which is consistent with recent work suggesting a high metabolic cost of eye development."
10.1101/031864,"In clonally propagated crops, non-additive genetic effects can be effectively exploited by the identification of superior genetic individuals as varieties. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a clonally propagated staple food crop that feeds hundreds of millions. We quantified the amount and nature of non-additive genetic variation for key traits in a breeding population of cassava from sub-Saharan Africa using additive and non-additive genome-wide marker-based relationship matrices. We then assessed the accuracy of genomic prediction of additive compared to total (additive plus non-additive) genetic value. We confirmed previous findings based on diallel populations, that non-additive genetic variation is significant, especially for yield traits. Further, we show that we total genetic value correlated more strongly to observed phenotypes than did additive value, although this is constrained by low broad-sense heritability and is not beneficial for traits with already high heritability. We address the implication of these results for cassava breeding and put our work in the context of previous results in cassava, and other plant and animal species."
10.1101/031898,"Plastids perform crucial cellular functions, including photosynthesis, across a wide variety of eukaryotes. Since endosymbiosis, plastids have maintained independent genomes that now display a wide diversity of gene content, genome structure, gene regulation mechanisms, and transmission modes. The evolution of plastid genomes depends on an input of de novo mutation, but our knowledge of mutation in the plastid is limited to indirect inference from patterns of DNA divergence between species. Here, we use a mutation accumulation experiment, where selection acting on mutations is rendered ineffective, combined with whole-plastid genome sequencing to directly characterize de novo mutation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that the mutation rates of the plastid and nuclear genomes are similar, but that the base spectra of mutations differ significantly. We integrate our measure of the mutation rate with a population genomic dataset of 20 individuals, and show that the plastid genome is subject to substantially stronger genetic drift than the nuclear genome. We also show that high levels of linkage disequilibrium in the plastid genome are not due to restricted recombination, but are instead a consequence of increased genetic drift. One likely explanation for increased drift in the plastid genome is that there are stronger effects of genetic hitchhiking. The presence of recombination in the plastid is consistent with laboratory studies in C. reinhardtii and demonstrates that although the plastid genome is thought to be uniparentally inherited, it recombines in nature at a rate similar to the nuclear genome."

10.1101/031997,"Although proteomics has made rapid progress in the past decade, researchers are still in the early stage of exploring the world of complex proteoforms, which are protein products with various primary structure alterations resulting from gene mutations, alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, and other biological processes. Proteoform identification is essential to mapping proteoforms to their biological functions as well as discovering novel proteoforms and new protein functions. Top-down mass spectrometry is the method of choice for identifying complex proteoforms because it provides a \""bird view\"" of intact proteoforms. The combinatorial explosion of possible proteoforms, which may result in billions of possible proteoforms for one protein, makes proteoform identification a challenging computational problem. Here we propose a new data structure, called the mass graph, for efficiently representing proteoforms. In addition, we design mass graph alignment algorithms for proteoform identification by top-down mass spectrometry. Experiments on a histone H4 mass spectrometry data set showed that the proposed methods outperformed MS-Align-E in identifying complex proteoforms."
10.1101/031948,"The morphology and function of organs depend on coordinated changes in gene expression during development. These changes are controlled by transcription factors, signaling pathways and their regulatory interactions, which are represented by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Therefore, the structure of an organ GRN restricts the morphological and functional variations that the organ can experience -its potential morphospace. Therefore, two important questions arise when studying any GRN: what is the predicted available morphospace and what are the regulatory linkages that contribute the most to control morphological variation within this space. Here, we explore these questions by analyzing a small \""3-node\"" GRN model that captures the Hh-driven regulatory interactions controlling a simple visual structure: the ocellar region of Drosophila. Analysis of the model predicts that random variation of model parameters results in a specific non-random distribution of morphological variants. Study of a limited sample of Drosophilids and other dipterans finds a correspondence between the predicted phenotypic range and that found in nature. As an alternative to simulations, we apply Bayesian Networks methods in order to identify the set of parameters with the largest contribution to morphological variation. Our results predict the potential morphological space of the ocellar complex, and identify likely candidate processes to be responsible for ocellar morphological evolution using Bayesian networks. We further discuss the assumptions that the approach we have taken entails and their validity."
10.1101/032003,"Mapping molecular QTLs has emerged as an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of cell functions. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, it is natural to incorporate genomic annotations into QTL discovery. In this paper, we describe a novel method, named TORUS, for integrative QTL discovery. Using hierarchical modeling, our approach embeds a rigorous enrichment analysis to quantify the enrichment level of each annotation in target QTLs. This enrichment information is then used to identify QTLs by up-weighting the genetic variants with relevant annotations using a Bayesian false discovery rate control procedure. Our proposed method only requires summary-level statistics and is highly efficient computationally: it runs a few hundreds times faster than the current gold-standard QTL discovery approach that relies on permutations. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method performs accurate enrichment analysis and controls the desired type I error rate while greatly improving the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations. Finally, we analyze the recently released expression-genotype data from 44 human tissues generated by the GTEx project. By integrating the simple annotation of SNP distance to transcription start sites, we discover more genes that harbor expression-associated SNPs in all 44 tissues, with an average increase of 1,485 genes."
10.1101/031906,"Genes play a central role in all biological processes. DNA microarray technology has made it possible to study the expression behavior of thousands of genes in one go. Often, gene expression data is used to generate features for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. At the same time, advances in the field of deep learning have made available a plethora of architectures. In this paper, we use deep architectures pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using denoising autoencoders as a preprocessing step for a popular unsupervised learning task. Denoising autoencoders (DA) can be used to learn a compact representation of input, and have been used to generate features for further supervised learning tasks. We propose that our deep architectures can be treated as empirical versions of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). We use our deep architectures to regenerate gene expression time series data for two different data sets. We test our hypothesis on two popular datasets for the unsupervised learning task of clustering and find promising improvements in performance."
10.1101/031914,"The field of molecular evolution started with the alignment of a few protein sequences in the early 1960s. Among the first results found, the genetic equidistance result has turned out to be the most unexpected. It directly inspired the ad hoc universal molecular clock hypothesis that in turn inspired the neutral theory. Unfortunately, however, what is only a maximum distance phenomenon was mistakenly transformed into a mutation rate phenomenon and became known as such. Previous work studied a small set of selected proteins. We have performed proteome wide studies of 7 different sets of proteomes involving a total of 15 species. All 7 sets showed that within each set of 3 species the least complex species is approximately equidistant in average proteome wide identity to the two more complex ones. Thus, the genetic equidis-tance result is a universal phenomenon of maximum distance. There is a reality of constant albeit stepwise or discontinuous increase in complexity during evolution, the rate of which is what the original molecular clock hypothesis is really about. These results provide additional lines of evidence for the recently proposed maximum genetic diversity (MGD) hypothesis.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code repository is publicly available at https://github.com/Sephiroth1st/EquidistanceScript\n\nContacthuangshi@sklmg.edu.cn\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online."
10.1101/031963,"Genome size evolution is a fundamental problem in molecular evolution. Statistical analysis of genome sizes brings new insight into the evolution of genome size. Although the variation of genome sizes is complicated, it is indicated that the genome size evolution can be explained more clearly at taxon level than at species level. I find that the genome size distribution for species in a taxon fits log-normal distribution. And I find a relationship between the phylogeny of life and the statistical features of genome size distributions among taxa. I observed different statistical features of genome size distributions between animal taxa and plant taxa. A log-normal stochastic process model is developed to simulate the genome size evolution. The simulation results on the log-normal distributions of genome sizes and their statistical features agree with the observations."
10.1101/032037,"Next-generation sequencing of DNA provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover rare genetic variants associated with complex diseases and traits. However, when testing the association between rare variants and traits of interest, the current practice of first calling underlying genotypes and then treating the called values as known is prone to false positive findings, especially when genotyping errors are systematically different between cases and controls. This happens whenever cases and controls are sequenced at different depths or on different platforms. In this article, we provide a likelihood-based approach to testing rare variant associations that directly models sequencing reads without calling genotypes. We consider the (weighted) burden test statistic, which is the (weighted) sum of the score statistic for assessing effects of individual variants on the trait of interest. Because variant locations are unknown, we develop a simple, computationally efficient screening algorithm to estimate the loci that are variants. Because our burden statistic may not have mean zero after screening, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for assessing the significance of the burden statistic. We demonstrate through extensive simulation studies that the proposed tests are robust to a wide range of differential sequencing qualities between cases and controls, and are at least as powerful as the standard genotype calling approach when the latter controls type I error. An application to the UK10K data reveals novel rare variants in gene BTBD18 associated with childhood onset obesity. The relevant software is freely available."
10.1101/031229,"The constantly decreasing cost and increasing out-put of current sequencing technologies enable large scale metagenomic studies of microbial communities from diverse habitats. Therefore, fast and accurate methods for taxonomic classification are needed, which can operate on increasingly larger datasets and reference databases. Recently, several fast metagenomic classifiers have been developed, which are based on comparison of genomic k-mers. However, nucleotide comparison using a fixed k-mer length often lacks the sensitivity to overcome the evolutionary distance between sampled species and genomes in the reference database. Here, we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju for fast assignment of reads to taxa. Kaiju finds maximum exact matches on the protein-level using the Borrows-Wheeler transform, and can optionally allow amino acid substitutions in the search using a greedy heuristic. We show in a genome exclusion study that Kaiju can classify more reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared to fast k-mer based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies more than twice as many reads in ten real metagenomes compared to programs based on genomic k-mers. Kaiju can process up to millions of reads per minute, and its memory footprint is below 6 GB of RAM, allowing the analysis on a standard PC.

10.1101/031930,"With Next Generation Sequencing Data (NGS) coming off age and being routinely used, evolutionary biology is transforming into a data-driven science.\n\nAs a consequence, researchers have to rely on a growing number of increasingly complex software. All widely used tools in our field have grown considerably, in terms of the number of features as well as lines of code. In addition, analysis pipelines now include substantially more components than 5-10 years ago.\n\nA topic that has received little attention in this context is the code quality of widely used codes. Unfortunately, the majority of users tend to blindly trust software and the results it produces. To this end, we assessed the code quality of 15 highly cited tools (e.g., MrBayes, MAFFT, SweepFinder etc.) from the broader area of evolutionary biology that are used in current data analysis pipelines.\n\nWe also discuss widely unknown problems associated with floating point arithmetics for representing real numbers on computer systems. Since, the software quality of the tools we analyzed is rather mediocre, we provide a list of best practices for improving the quality of existing tools, but also list techniques that can be deployed for developing reliable, high quality scientific software from scratch.\n\nFinally, we also discuss journal and science policy as well as funding issues that need to be addressed for improving software quality as well as ensuring support for developing new and maintaining existing software.\n\nOur intention is to raise the awareness of the community regarding software quality issues and to emphasize the substantial lack of funding for scientific software development."
10.1101/032078,"Cell fate determination by lateral inhibition via Notch/Delta signalling has been extensively studied. Most formalised models consider Notch/Delta interactions in fields of cells, with parameters that typically lead to symmetry breaking of signalling states between neighbouring cells, commonly resulting in salt-and-pepper fate patterns. Here we consider the case of signalling between isolated cell pairs, and find that the bifurcation properties of a standard mathematical model of lateral inhibition can lead to stable symmetric signalling states. We apply this model to the adult intestinal stem cell (ISC) of Drosophila, whose fate is stochastic but dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. We observe a correlation between signalling state in cell pairs and their contact area. We interpret this behaviour in terms of the properties of our model in the presence of population variability in signalling thresholds. Our results suggest that the dynamics of Notch/Delta signalling can contribute to explain stochasticity in stem cell fate decisions, and that the standard model for lateral inhibition can account for a wider range of developmental outcomes than previously considered.\n\nSummary statementNotch/Delta-mediated lateral inhibition in cell pairs can result in symmetric signalling depending on the activation threshold, which can modulate cell-fate decisions depending on contact area."
10.1101/032060,"Recently, the finding of 8,000 year old wheat DNA from submerged marine sediments (1) was challenged on the basis of a lack of signal of cytosine deamination relative to three other data sets generated from young samples of herbarium and museum specimens, and a 7,000 year old human skeleton preserved in a cave environment (2). The study used a new approach for low coverage data sets to which tools such as mapDamage cannot be applied to infer chemical damage patterns. Here we show from the analysis of 148 palaeogenomic data sets that the rate of cytosine deamination is a thermally correlated process, and that organellar generally shows higher rates of deamination than nuclear DNA in comparable environments. We categorize four clusters of deamination rates (,{beta},{gamma},{varepsilon}) that are associated with cold stable environments, cool but thermally fluctuating environments, and progressively warmer environments. These correlations show that the expected level of deamination in the sedaDNA would be extremely low. The low coverage approach to detect DNA damage by Weiss et al. (2) fails to identify damage samples from the cold class of deamination rates. Finally, different enzymes used in library preparation processes exhibit varying capability in reporting cytosine deamination damage in the 5 region of fragments. The PCR enzyme used in the sedaDNA study would not have had the capability to report 5 cytosine deamination, as they do not read over uracil residues, and signatures of damage would have better been sought at the 3 end. The 8,000 year old sedaDNA matches both the thermal age prediction of fragmentation, and the expected level of cytosine deamination for the preservation environment. Given these facts and the use of rigorous controls these data meet the criteria of authentic ancient DNA to an extremely stringent level."
10.1101/032086,"AbstractMulti-scale agent-based models are increasingly used to simulate tumor growth dynamics. Simulating such complex systems is often a great challenge despite large computational power of modern computers and, thus, implementation techniques are becoming as important as the models themselves. Here we show, using a simple agent-based model of tumor growth, how the computational time required for simulation can be decreased by using vectorization techniques. In numerical examples we observed up to 30-fold increases in computation performance when standard approaches were, at least in part, replaced with vectorized routines in MATLAB."
10.1101/031922,"In the context of climate change and species invasions, range shifts increasingly gain attention because the rates at which they occur in the Anthropocene induce fast shifts in biological assemblages. During such range shifts, species experience multiple selection pressures. Especially for poleward expansions, a straightforward interpretation of the observed evolutionary dynamics is hampered because of the joint action of evolutionary processes related to spatial selection and to adaptation towards local climatic conditions. To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and empirical approaches, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. We demonstrate considerable latitudinal quantitative genetic divergence in life-history traits in T. urticae, that was shaped by both spatial selection and local adaptation. The former mainly affected dispersal behavior, while development was mainly shaped by adaptation to the local climate. Divergence in life-history traits in species shifting their range poleward can consequently be jointly determined by fast local adaptation to the environmental gradient and contemporary evolutionary dynamics resulting from spatial selection. The integration of modeling with common garden experiments provides a powerful tool to study the contribution of these two evolutionary processes on life-history evolution during range expansion."
10.1101/032045,"BackgroundScaffolding is a crucial step in the genome assembly process. Current methods based on large fragment paired-end reads or long reads allow an increase in continuity but often lack consistency in repetitive regions, resulting in fragmented assemblies. Here, we describe a novel tool to link assemblies to a genome map to aid complex genome reconstruction by detecting assembly errors and allowing scaffold ordering and anchoring.\n\nResultsWe present MaGuS (map-guided scaffolding), a modular tool that uses a draft genome assembly, a genome map, and high-throughput paired-end sequencing data to estimate the quality and to enhance the continuity of an assembly. We generated several assemblies of the Arabidopsis genome using different scaffolding programs and applied MaGuS to select the best assembly using quality metrics. Then, we used MaGuS to perform map-guided scaffolding to increase continuity by creating new scaffold links in low-covered and highly repetitive regions where other commonly used scaffolding methods lack consistency.\n\nConclusionsMaGuS is a powerful reference-free evaluator of assembly quality and a map-guided scaffolder that is freely available at https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/MaGuS. Its use can be extended to other high-throughput sequencing data (e.g., long-read data) and also to other map data (e.g., genetic maps) to improve the quality and the continuity of large and complex genome assemblies."
10.1101/032102,"AbstractFor quantitative cancer models to be meaningful and interpretable the number of unknown parameters must be kept minimal. Experimental data can be utilized to calibrate model dynamics rates or rate constants. Proper integration of experimental data, however, depends on the chosen theoretical framework.

10.1101/032201,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The nucleotidyl cyclase toxin ExoY is a virulence factors injected by the pathogen and associated with severe damage to lung tissue. ExoY-like cyclases are also found in other Gram-negative pathogens and shown to contribute to virulence, although they remained poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that filamentous actin (F-actin) is the hitherto unknown co-factor that activates P. aeruginosa ExoY within host target cells. Highly purified actin, when polymerized into filaments, potently stimulates (>10,000 fold) ExoY activity. ExoY co-localizes in vivo with actin filaments in transfected cells and, in vitro, it interferes with the regulation of actin assembly/disassembly-dynamics mediated by important F-actin-binding proteins. We further show that actin also activates an ExoY-like adenylate cyclase from a Vibrio species. Our results thus highlight a new sub-class within the class II adenylyl cyclase family, defined as actin-activated nucleotidyl cyclase (AA-NC) toxins."

Wikidata is a growing, open community database which can serve this purpose and also provides tight integration with Wikipedia.\n\nIn order to improve the state of biological data, facilitate data management and dissemination, we imported all human and mouse genes, and all human and mouse proteins into Wikidata. In total, 59,530 human genes and 73,130 mouse genes have been imported from NCBI and 27,662 human proteins and 16,728 mouse proteins have been imported from the Swissprot subset of UniProt. As Wikidata is open and can be edited by anybody, our corpus of imported data serves as the starting point for integration of further data by scientists, the Wikidata community and citizen scientists alike. The first use case for this data is to populate Wikipedia Gene Wiki infoboxes directly from Wikidata with the data integrated above. This enables immediate updates of the Gene Wiki infoboxes as soon as the data in Wikidata is modified. Although Gene Wiki pages are currently only on the English language version of Wikipedia, the multilingual nature of Wikidata allows for a usage of the data we imported in all 280 different language Wikipedias. Apart from the Gene Wiki infobox use case, a powerful SPARQL endpoint and up to date exporting functionality (e.g. JSON, XML) enable very convenient further use of the data by scientists.\n\nIn summary, we created a fully open and extensible data resource for human and mouse molecular biology and biochemistry data.

Neptunes loci discovery process identifies sequences that are sufficiently common to a group of target sequences and sufficiently absent from non-targets using probabilistic models. Neptune uses parallel computing to efficiently identify and extract these loci from draft genome assemblies without requiring multiple sequence alignments or other computationally expensive comparative sequence analyses. Tests on simulated and real data sets showed that Neptune rapidly identifies regions that are both sensitive and specific. We demonstrate that this system can identify trait-specific loci from different bacterial lineages.

10.1101/031880,"Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors. We devised a novel mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated. Our results show that current recommendations for abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not reduce the length of time the public health community must stay vigilant. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts."
10.1101/032110,"Accurate detection of the human metaphase chromosome centromere is an critical element of cytogenetic diagnostic techniques, including chromosome enumeration, karyotyping and radiation biodosimetry. Existing image processing methods can perform poorly in the presence of irregular boundaries, shape variations and premature sister chromatid separation, which can adversely affect centromere localization. We present a centromere detection algorithm that uses a novel profile thickness measurement technique on irregular chromosome structures defined by contour partitioning. Our algorithm generates a set of centromere candidates which are then evaluated based on a set of features derived from images of chromosomes. Our method also partitions the chromosome contour to isolate its telomere regions and then detects and corrects for sister chromatid separation. When tested with a chromosome database consisting of 1400 chromosomes collected from 40 metaphase cell images, the candidate based centromere detection algorithm was able to accurately localize 1220 centromere locations yielding a detection accuracy of 87%. We also introduce a Candidate Based Centromere Confidence (CBCC) metric which indicates an approximate confidence value of a given centromere detection and can be readily extended into other candidate related detection problems."
10.1101/032151,"The lipopolysaccharide (O) and flagellar (H) surface antigens of Escherichia coli are targets for serotyping that have traditionally been used to identify pathogenic lineages of E. coli. As serotyping has several limitations, public health reference laboratories are increasingly moving towards whole genome sequencing (WGS) for the rapid characterisation of bacterial isolates. Here we present a method to rapidly and accurately serotype E. coli isolates from raw, short read sequence data, leveraging the known genetic basis for the biosynthesis of O- and H-antigens. Our approach bypasses the need for de novo genome assembly by directly screening WGS reads against a curated database of alleles linked to known E. coli O-groups and H-types (the EcOH database) using the software package SRST2. We validated our approach by comparing in silico results with those obtained via serological phenotyping of 197 enteropathogenic (EPEC) isolates. We also demonstrated the utility of our method to characterise enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) epidemic clone ST131, and for in silico serotyping of foodborne outbreak-related isolates in the public GenomeTrakr database."
10.1101/032136,"Gal3p is an allosteric monomeric protein which activates the GAL genetic switch of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to galactose. Expression of constitutive mutant of Gal3p or over-expression of wild-type Gal3p activates the GAL switch in the absence of galactose. These data suggest that Gal3p exists as an ensemble of active and inactive conformations. Structural data has indicated that Gal3p exists in open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations. However, mutant of Gal3p that predominantly exists in inactive conformation and yet capable of responding to galactose has not been isolated. To understand the mechanism of allosteric transition, we have isolated a triple mutant of Gal3p with V273I, T404A and N450D substitutions which upon over-expression fails to activate the GAL switch on its own, but activates the switch in response to galactose. Over-expression of Gal3p mutants with single or double mutations in any of the three combinations failed to exhibit the behavior of the triple mutant. Molecular dynamics analysis of the wild-type and the triple mutant along with two previously reported constitutive mutants suggests that the wild-type Gal3p may also exist in super-open conformation. Further, our results suggest that the dynamics of residue F237 situated in the hydrophobic pocket located in the hinge region drives the transition between different conformations. Based on our study and what is known in human glucokinase, we suggest that the above mechanism could be a general theme in causing the allosteric transition."
10.1101/032169,"We examined the biogeography of Streptomyces at regional spatial scales to identify factors that govern patterns of microbial diversity. Streptomyces are spore forming filamentous bacteria which are widespread in soil. Streptomyces strains were isolated from perennial grass habitats sampled across a spatial scale of more than 6,000 km. Previous analysis of this geographically explicit culture collection provided evidence for a latitudinal diversity gradient in Streptomyces species. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that this latitudinal diversity gradient is a result of evolutionary dynamics associated with historical demographic processes. Historical demographic phenomena have genetic consequences that can be evaluated through analysis of population genetics. We applied population genetic approaches to analyze population structure in six of the most numerically abundant and geographically widespread Streptomyces phylogroups from our culture collection. Streptomyces population structure varied at regional spatial scales and allelic diversity correlated with geographic distance. In addition, allelic diversity and gene flow are partitioned by latitude. Finally, we found that nucleotide diversity within phylogroups is negatively correlated with latitude. These results indicate that phylogroup diversification is constrained by dispersal limitation at regional spatial scales and they are consistent with the hypothesis that historical demographic processes have influenced the contemporary biogeography of Streptomyces.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementWe provide the first population genetic evidence that patterns of Streptomyces biogeography, which manifest in geographically explicit patterns of gene flow and a latitudinal gradient of nucleotide diversity, result from dispersal limitation and regional diversification due to drift. This contribution elucidates evolutionary processes that underlie patterns of microbial biogeography."
10.1101/032128,"BackgroundPlant meristems are analogous to animal stem cell niches as they maintain a pool of undifferentiated cells that divide and differentiate to give rise to organs. The carpel margin meristem is a vital, multi-potent structure located in the medial domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana gynoecium, the female floral reproductive organ. The carpel margin meristem generates ovules that upon fertilization become seeds. The molecular mechanisms that specify this meristematic region and regulate its organogenic potential are poorly understood. Here, we present an analysis of the transcriptional profile of the medial domain of the Arabidopsis gynoecium highlighting the developmental stages that immediately proceed ovule initiation, the earliest stages of seed development.\n\nResultsUsing a floral synchronization system and a SHATTERPROOF2 domain-specific reporter, paired with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing, we assayed the transcriptome of the gynoecial medial domain with temporal and spatial precision. This analysis reveals a set of genes that are differentially expressed within the SHATTERPROOF2 expression domain that marks portions of the developing medial domain. Many members of this gene set have been shown previously to function during the development of medial domain-derived structures, including the ovules, thus validating our approach. Other uncharacterized members including differentially expressed cis-natural antisense transcripts, are potential novel regulators of medial domain development. Members of the REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM (REM) family of transcriptional regulators were enriched in the SHATTERPROOF2-expressing cell population including a previously unrecognized REM family member. Finally, the analysis transcriptional isoforms in the medial domain identified genes that may exhibit \""isoform switching\"" behavior during gynoecial development.\n\nConclusionsThis data set provides genome-wide transcriptional insight into the development of the gynoecial medial domain that contains the carpel margin meristem, a vital reproductive structure that gives rise to the ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana."
10.1101/032250,"Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to examine closely related organisms. However, while genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide an excellent resource for phylogenetic reconstruction, to date evolutionary analyses have been performed using different ad hoc methods that are not often widely applicable across different projects. To facilitate the construction of robust phylogenies, we have developed a method for genome-wide identification/characterization of SNPs from sequencing reads and genome assemblies. Our phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary (PhaME) analysis software is unique in its ability to take reads and draft/complete genome(s) as input, derive core genome alignments, identify SNPs, construct phylogenies and perform evolutionary analyses. Several examples using genomes and read datasets for bacterial, eukaryotic and viral linages demonstrate the broad and robust functionality of PhaME. Furthermore, the ability to incorporate raw metagenomic reads from clinical samples with suspected infectious agents shows promise for the rapid phylogenetic characterization of pathogens within complex samples."
10.1101/032243,"Disrupted in Schizophrenia1 (DISC1) is known as a high susceptibility gene of schizophrenia. More recent studies have connected schizophrenia with glia defects and dysfunction. However, it is unclear whether there is connection between DISC1 and gliogenesis defect. Thus, a precise understanding of DISC1 (a ubiquitously expressed brain protein) on astrogenesis in the late stage of embryonic mouse brain development needs to be deeply investigated. Here, we show that suppression of DISC1 expression represses astrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, whereas DISC1 overexpression substantially enhances the process. Furthermore, mouse and human DISC1 overexpression rescued astrogenesis defects caused by DISC1 knowndown. Mechanistically, DISC1 activates downstream RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway via directly associating with the C terminal domain of RASSF7, a RAS association protein. Also, the pERK complex undergoes nuclear translocation and influences the expression of genes related to astrogenesis. Briefly, our results demonstrate that DISC1 regulates astrogenesis by modulating RAS/MEK/ERK signaling via RASSF7 and provide a framework for understanding how DISC1 dysfunction leads to neuropsychiatric diseases."
10.1101/032276,"Rust fungal pathogens of wheat (Triticum spp.) affect crop yields worldwide. The molecular mechanisms underlying the virulence of these pathogens remain elusive, due to the limited availability of suitable molecular genetic research tools. Notably, the inability to perform high-throughput analyses of candidate virulence proteins (also known as effectors) impairs progress. We previously established a pipeline for the fast-forward screens of rust fungal effectors in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. This pipeline involves selecting candidate effectors in silico and performing cell biology and protein-protein interaction assays in planta to gain insight into the putative functions of candidate effectors. In this study, we used this pipeline to identify and characterize sixteen candidate effectors from the wheat yellow rust fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f sp tritici. Nine candidate effectors targeted a specific plant subcellular compartment or protein complex, providing valuable information on their putative functions in plant cells. One candidate effector, PST02549, accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies), protein complexes involved in mRNA decapping, degradation, and storage. PST02549 also associates with the P-body-resident ENHANCER OF mRNA DECAPPING PROTEIN 4 (EDC4) from N. benthamiana and wheat. Our work identifies P-bodies as a novel plant cell compartment targeted by pathogen effectors."
10.1101/032367,"PurposeThe findings of EGFR mutations and the development of targeted therapies have significantly improved the overall survival of lung cancer patients. Still, the prognosis remains poor, so we need to know more about the genetic alterations in lung cancer. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in lung cancer, and microRNAs can regulate EGFR. So it is very important to predict the candidate microRNAs that target mutated EGFR and to investigate the role of these candidate microRNAs in lung cancer.\n\nMaterials and methodsIn this study, we investigated the difference of microRNAs expression between lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletion (H1650 and PC9) and its wild-type (H1299 and A549) using the Phalanx Human Whole Genome Microarray. Then the expression of individual microRNAs was validated by qRT-PCR assays. Moreover, we have detected the microRNAs expression in serum of lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion and wild-type.\n\nResultsThe expression of 1,732 microRNAs was evaluated, and we found that microRNAs expression was different between these two groups. Hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-203, hsa-miR-3182, hsa-miR-934 were up-regulated and hsa-miR-3196 was down-regulated in the EGFR exon 19 deletion group compared with wild-type group. The detection of circulating microRNAs showed that miR-3196 was down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR exon 19 deletion compared with wild-type.\n\nConclusionsIt is suggested that microRNAs associate with EGFR exon 19 deletion and miR-3196 can be further explored for potential predictor and targeted biomarker when it is difficult to get the tumors."

10.1101/032300,"Applying highly sensitive modern immune profiling techniques to the blood or inflamed tissue of auto-immune patients with one of the common T-cell mediated diseases fails to detect large clonal expansions or other signs of a dysregulated immune system. Additionally, these new methods have shown that self-reactive T-cells are found in the periphery (and are not completely negatively selected in the thymus as previously believed). Combining these new data with well-established studies in auto-immunity leads to the conjecture that certain auto-immune diseases are likely to be caused by defects in tissue, not by dysregulation of the adaptive immune system. In particular, one hypothesis is that specific tissues up-regulate HLA class 2 genes, presenting epitopes that are bound by CD4+ helper T cells, which facilitates an immune response against the tissue specific cells."
10.1101/032359,"Despite the central role of alternative sigma factors in bacterial stress response and virulence their regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we investigate one of the best-studied examples of alternative sigma factors: the {sigma}B network that controls the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis to uncover widely relevant general design principles that describe the structure-function relationship of alternative sigma factor regulatory networks. We show that the relative stoichiometry of the synthesis rates of {sigma}B, its anti-sigma factor RsbW and the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV plays a critical role in shaping the network behavior by forcing the {sigma}B network to function as an ultrasensitive negative feedback loop. We further demonstrate how this negative feedback regulation insulates alternative sigma factor activity from competition with the housekeeping sigma factor for RNA polymerase and allows multiple stress sigma factors to function simultaneously with little competitive interference.\n\nMajor Subject Areas: Computational and systems biology, Microbiology & Infectious disease\n\nResearch Organism: Bacillus subtilis"
10.1101/032383,"Background: Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions. Methods: Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge. Results: Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html Conclusions: BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method. Using biologically sound penalties and data-driven parameters, it improves three state-of-the-art GRN inference methods. It is applicable as a generic network inference post-processing, due its computational efficiency."
10.1101/032417,"Neuroticism is a personality trait of fundamental importance for psychological wellbeing and public health. It is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and several other psychiatric conditions. Although neuroticism is heritable, attempts to identify the alleles involved in previous studies have been limited by relatively small sample sizes and heterogeneity in the measurement of neuroticism. Here we report a genome-wide association study of neuroticism in 91,370 participants of the UK Biobank cohort and a combined meta-analysis which includes a further 7,197 participants from the Generation Scotland Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and 8,687 participants from a Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) cohort. All participants were assessed using the same neuroticism instrument, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQ-R-S) Short Forms Neuroticism scale. We found a SNP-based heritability estimate for neuroticism of approximately 15% (SE = 0.7%). Meta-analysis identified 9 novel loci associated with neuroticism. The strongest evidence for association was at a locus on chromosome 8 (p = 1.28x10-15) spanning 4 Mb and containing at least 36 genes. Other associated loci included genes of interest on chromosome 1 (GRIK3, glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 3), chromosome 4 (KLHL2, Kelch-like protein 2), chromosome 17 (CRHR1, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 and MAPT, microtubule-associated protein Tau), and on chromosome 18 (CELF4, CUGBP elav-like family member 4). We found no evidence for genetic differences in the common allelic architecture of neuroticism by sex. By comparing our findings with those of the Psychiatric Genetics Consortia, we identified a large genetic correlation between neuroticism and MDD (0.64) and a smaller genetic correlation with schizophrenia (0.22) but not with bipolar disorder. Polygenic scores derived from the primary UK Biobank sample captured about 1% of the variance in trait liability to neuroticism. Overall, our findings confirm a polygenic basis for neuroticism and substantial shared genetic architecture between neuroticism and MDD. The identification of 9 new neuroticism-associated loci will drive forward future work on the neurobiology of neuroticism and related phenotypes."
10.1101/032441,"We have previously established two lines of rat for studying the functional basis of aerobic exercise capacity (AEC) and its impact on metabolic health. The two lines, high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR), have been selectively bred for high and low intrinsic AEC, respectively. They were started from the same genetically heterogeneous population and have now diverged in both AEC and many other physiological measures, including weight, body composition, blood pressure, body mass index, lung capacity, lipid and glucose metabolism, and natural life span. In order to exploit this rat model to understand the genomic regions under differential selection within the two lines, we used SNP genotype and whole genome pooled sequencing data to identify signatures of selection using three different statistics: runs of homozygosity, fixation index, and aberrant allele frequency spectrum, and developed a composite score that combined the three signals. We found that several pathways (ATP transport and fatty acid metabolism) are enriched in regions under differential selection. The candidate genes and pathways under selection will be integrated with the previous mRNA expression data and future F2 QTL results for a multi-omics approach to understanding the biological basis of AEC and metabolic traits."
10.1101/032458,"Sequencing pathogen samples during a communicable disease outbreak is becoming an increasingly common procedure in epidemiological investigations. Identifying who infected whom sheds considerable light on transmission patterns, high-risk settings and subpopulations, and infection control effectiveness. Genomic data shed new light on transmission dynamics, and can be used to identify clusters of individuals likely to be linked by direct transmission. However, identification of individual routes of infection via single genome samples typically remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the potential of deep sequence data to provide greater resolution on transmission routes, via the identification of shared genomic variants. We assess several easily implemented methods to identify transmission routes using both shared variants and genetic distance, demonstrating that shared variants can provide considerable additional information in most scenarios. While shared variant approaches identify relatively few links in the presence of a small transmission bottleneck, these links are highly confident. Furthermore, we proposed hybrid approach additionally incorporating phylogenetic distance to provide greater resolution. We apply our methods to data collected during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, identifying several likely routes of transmission. Our study highlights the power of pathogen deep sequence data as a component of outbreak investigation and epidemiological analyses."
10.1101/032391,"Analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pattern similarity is becoming increasingly popular because it allows one to relate distributed patterns of voxel activity to continuous perceptual and cognitive states of the human brain. Here we show that fMRI pattern similarity estimates are severely affected by temporal pattern drifts in fMRI data - even after voxel-wise detrending. For this particular dataset, the drift effect obscures orientation information as measured by fMRI pattern dissimilarities. We demonstrate that orientation information can be recovered using three different methods: 1. Regressing out the drift component through linear modeling; 2. Computing representational distances between conditions measured in independent imaging runs; 3. Crossvalidation of pattern distance estimates. One possible source of temporal pattern drift could be random walk like fluctuations -- physiological or scanner related -- occurring within single voxel timecourses. This explanation is consistent with voxel-wise detrending not alleviating pattern drift effects. In addition, this would explain why crossvalidated pattern distances are robust to temporal drift because a random walk process is expected to give rise to non-replicable drift directions. Given these findings, we recommend that future fMRI studies take pattern drift into account when analyzing pattern similarity as this can greatly enhance the sensitivity to experimental effects of interest."
10.1101/032409,"We investigate the properties of the recently proposed \""shotgun\"" sampling approach for the common inputs problem in the functional estimation of neuronal connectivity. We study the asymptotic correctness, the speed of convergence, and the data size requirements of such an approach. We find that the shotgun approach can be expected to allow the inference of the complete connectivity matrix in large neuronal populations under some rather general conditions. However, we find that the posterior error of the shotgun connectivity estimator may grow quickly with the size of the unobserved neuronal populations, the connectivity strength, and the square of the observations sparseness. This implies that the shotgun connectivity estimation will require significant amounts of neuronal activity data whenever the number of neurons in the observed populations is small. We present a numerical approach for solving the shotgun estimation problem in general settings and use it to demonstrate the shotgun connectivity inference in simulated synfire and weakly coupled cortical neuronal networks."

10.1101/032508,"Damage to Drosophila melanogaster imaginal discs activates a regeneration checkpoint that 1) extends larval development and 2) coordinates the regeneration of the damaged disc with the growth of undamaged discs. These two systemic responses to damage are both mediated by Dilp8, a member of the insulin/IGF/relaxin family of peptide hormones, which is released by regenerating imaginal discs. Growth coordination between regenerating and undamaged imaginal discs is dependent on Dilp8 activation of NOS in the prothoracic gland (PG), which slows the growth of undamaged discs by limiting ecdysone synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the Drosophila relaxin receptor homologue Lgr3, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor, is required for Dilp8-dependent growth coordination and developmental delay during the regeneration checkpoint. Lgr3 regulates these responses to damage via distinct mechanisms in different tissues. Using tissue-specific RNAi disruption of Lgr3 expression, we show that Lgr3 functions in the PG upstream of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and is necessary for NOS activation and growth coordination during the regeneration checkpoint. When Lgr3 is depleted from neurons, imaginal disc damage no longer produces either developmental delay or growth inhibition. To reconcile these discrete tissue requirements for Lgr3 during regenerative growth coordination, we demonstrate that Lgr3 activity in the both the CNS and PG is necessary for NOS activation in the PG following damage. Together, these results identify new roles for a relaxin receptor in mediating damage signaling to regulate growth and developmental timing."
10.1101/032482,"In all populations, as the time runs, crossovers break apart ancestor haplotypes, forming smaller blocks at each generation. Some blocks, and eventually all of them, become identical by descent because of the genetic drift. We have in this paper developed and benchmarked a theoretical prediction of the mean length of such blocks and used it to study a simple population model assuming panmixia, no selfing and drift as the only evolutionary pressure. Besides, we have on the one hand derived, for any user defined error threshold, the range of the parameters this prediction is reliable for, and on the other hand shown that the mean length remains constant over time in ideally large populations."
10.1101/032490,"Locomotor recovery from anoxia follows the restoration of disordered ion distributions and neuronal excitability. The time taken for locomotor recovery after 30 s anoxia (around 10 min) is longer than the time for the propagation of action potentials to be restored (less than 1 min) in Drosophila wild-type. We report here that the white (w) gene modulates the timing of locomotor recovery. Wild-type flies displayed fast and consistent recovery of locomotion from anoxia, whereas mutants of w showed significantly delayed recovery. Genetic analysis including serial backcrossing revealed a strong association between the w locus and the timing of locomotor recovery, and haplo-insufficient function of w+ in promoting fast locomotor recovery. The locomotor recovery phenotype was independent of classic eye pigmentation, although both are associated with the w gene. Introducing up to four copies of mini-white (mw+) into w1118 was insufficient to promote fast and consistent locomotor recovery. However, flies carrying w+ duplicated to Y chromosome showed wild-type-like fast locomotor recovery. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of w in neurons but not glia delayed locomotor recovery, and specifically, knockdown of w in putative subsets of serotonin neurons was sufficient to delay the locomotor recovery. These data reveal an additional role for w in modulating the timing of locomotor recovery from anoxia."
10.1101/032532,"Determining residue level protein properties, such as the sites for post-translational modifications (PTMs) are vital to understanding proteins at all levels of function. Experimental methods are costly and time-consuming, thus high confidence predictions become essential for functional knowledge at a genomic scale. Traditional computational methods based on strict rules (e.g. regular expressions) fail to annotate sites that lack substantial similarity. Thus, Machine Learning (ML) methods become fundamental in annotating proteins with unknown function. We present ASAP (Amino-acid Sequence Annotation Prediction), a universal ML framework for residue-level predictions. ASAP extracts efficiently and fast large set of window-based features from raw sequences. The platform also supports easy integration of external features such as secondary structure or PSSM profiles. The features are then combined to train underlying ML classifiers. We present a detailed case study for ASAP that was used to train CleavePred, a state-of-the-art protein precursor cleavage sites predictor. Protein cleavage is a fundamental PTM shared by a wide variety of protein groups with minimal sequence similarity. Current computational methods have high false positive rates, making them suboptimal for this task. CleavePred has a simple Python API, and is freely accessible via a web-based application. The high performance of ASAP toward the task of precursor cleavage is suited for analyzing new proteomes at a genomic scale. The tool is attractive to protein design, mass spectrometry search engines and the discovery of new peptide hormones. In summary, we illustrate ASAP as an entry point for predicting PTMs. The approach and flexibility of the platform can easily be extended for additional residue specific tasks.

10.1101/032284,"The physical principles underlying the biomechanics of morphogenetic processes are largely unknown. Epiboly is an essential embryonic event in which three distinct tissues coordinate to direct the expansion of the blastoderm. How and where forces are generated during epiboly and how these are globally coupled remains elusive. Here we first develop a method, Hydrodynamic Regression (HR), to infer 3D dynamic pressure fields, mechanical power densities and cortical surface tension profiles within living organisms. HR is based on velocity measurements retrieved from 2D+T microscopy time-lapses and their hydrodynamic modeling. We then applied this method to identify biomechanically active structures during epiboly in the zebrafish and the changes in the distribution of cortex local tension as epiboly progresses. Based on these results, we propose a novel simple physical description for epiboly, where tissue movements are directed by a polarized gradient of cortical tension. We found that this tensional gradient relies on local contractile forces at the cortex, differences in the elastic properties of cortex components and force passive transmission within the incompressible yolk cell. All in all, our work identifies a novel way to physically regulate concerted cellular movements that will be fundamental for the mechanical control of many morphogenetic processes."
10.1101/032565,"In the age of genome-scale DNA sequencing, choice of molecular marker arguably remains an important decision in planning a phylogenetic study. Using published genomes from 23 primate species, we make a standardized comparison of four of the most frequently used protocols in phylogenomics, viz., targeted sequence-enrichment using ultraconserved element and exon-capture probes, and reduced genomic representation using restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq and ddRAD-seq). Here we present a procedure to perform in silico extractions from genomes and create directly comparable datasets for each class of marker. We then compare these datasets in terms of both phylogenetic resolution and ability to consistently and precisely estimate clade ages using fossil-calibrated molecular-clock models. Furthermore, we were also able to directly compare these results to previously published datasets from Sanger-sequenced nuclear exons and mitochondrial genomes under the same analytical conditions. Our results show--although with the exception of the mitochondrial genome and ddRADseq datasets--that for uncontroversial nodes all data classes performed equally well, i.e. they recovered the same well supported topology. However, for one difficult-to-resolve node comprising a rapid diversification (subfamilial relationships among the Cebidae), we report well supported but conflicting topologies among the marker classes, likely the result of mismodelling of gene tree heterogeneity. Likewise, clade age estimates showed consistent discrepancies between datasets; for recent nodes, clade ages estimated by nuclear exon datasets were younger than those of the UCE, RAD and mitochondrial data, but vice versa for the deepest nodes in the primate phylogeny. This effect can be explained by temporal differences in phylogenetic informativeness and choice of clock model used. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing that while huge numbers of loci are probably not required for uncontroversial phylogenetic questions--for which practical considerations such as cost and ease of data generation/sharing/aggregating therefore become increasingly important--accurately modelling heterogeneous data remains as relevant as ever for the more recalcitrant problems."
10.1101/032474,"Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) result in millions of summary statistics (\""z-scores\"") for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with phenotypes. These rich datasets afford deep insights into the nature and extent of genetic contributions to complex phenotypes such as psychiatric disorders, which are understood to have substantial genetic components that arise from very large numbers of SNPs. The complexity of the datasets, however, poses a significant challenge to maximizing their utility. This is reflected in a need for better understanding the landscape of z-scores, as such knowledge would enhance causal SNP and gene discovery, help elucidate mechanistic pathways, and inform future study design. Here we present a parsimonious methodology for modeling effect sizes and replication probabilities that does not require raw genotype data, relying only on summary statistics from GWAS substudies, and a scheme allowing for direct empirical validation. We show that modeling z-scores as a mixture of Gaussians is conceptually appropriate, in particular taking into account ubiquitous non-null effects that are likely in the datasets due to weak linkage disequilibrium with causal SNPs. The four-parameter model allows for estimating the degree of polygenicity of the phenotype - the proportion of SNPs (after uniform pruning, so that large LD blocks are not over-represented) likely to be in strong LD with causal/mechanistically associated SNPs - and predicting the proportion of chip heritability explainable by genome-wide significant SNPs in future studies with larger sample sizes. We apply the model to recent GWAS of schizophrenia (N=82,315) and additionally, for purposes of illustration, putamen volume (N=12,596), with approximately 9.3 million SNP z-scores in both cases. We show that, over a broad range of z-scores and sample sizes, the model accurately predicts expectation estimates of true effect sizes and replication probabilities in multistage GWAS designs. We estimate the degree to which effect sizes are over-estimated when based on linear-regression association coefficients. We estimate the polygenicity of schizophrenia to be 0.037 and the putamen to be 0.001, while the respective sample sizes required to approach fully explaining the chip heritability are 106 and 105. The model can be extended to incorporate prior knowledge such as pleiotropy and SNP annotation. The current findings suggest that the model is applicable to a broad array of complex phenotypes and will enhance understanding of their genetic architectures."
10.1101/029058,"The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is a commonly observed potential in scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies related to the valence of feedback about a subjects performance. This potential classically manifests as a negative deflection in medial frontocentral EEG contacts following negative feedback. Recent work has shown prominence of theta power in the spectral composition of the FRN, placing it within the larger class of \""frontal midline theta\"" cognitive control signals. Although the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is thought to be the cortical generator of the FRN, conclusive data regarding its origin and propagation are lacking. Here we examine intracranial electrophysiology from the human medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in order to better understand the anatomical localization and communication patterns of the FRN. We show that the FRN is evident in both low- and high-frequency local field potentials (LFPs) recorded on electrocorticography. The FRN is larger in medial compared to lateral PFC, and coupling between theta band phase and high frequency LFP power is also greater in medial PFC. Using Granger causality and conditional mutual information analyses, we provide evidence that feedback-related information propagates from medial to lateral PFC, and that this information transfer oscillates with theta-range periodicity. These results provide evidence for the dACC as the cortical source of the FRN, provide insight into the local computation of frontal midline theta, and have implications for reinforcement learning models of cognitive control.\n\nSignificance Statement: Using intracranial electrophysiology in humans, this work addresses questions about a frequently studied feedback-related electroencephalographic signal, illuminating anatomical and functional properties of the representation of feedback-related reinforcement during decision-making across the medial to lateral extent of the human prefrontal cortex."
10.1101/032557,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a characteristic gene expression signature in postmortem cortex is shared across most ASD cases. Knowing whether this signature reflects changes in cells of particular types would help to determine the molecular, cellular, and anatomical etiology of ASD. To investigate we took advantage of cell type marker genes defined by recent single cell transcriptome sequencing from mouse or human cortex. We find that microglial markers showed significantly and substantially higher median expression in postmortem ASD than in control cortex for both mouse and human markers (21% higher for orthologous markers defined in mouse; 93% higher for human markers). In contrast, neuronal markers showed reduced median expression: 12% and 16% lower for mouse interneurons and pyramidal neurons, 40% lower for human neurons, and 36% lower for a class of human excitatory projection neurons. Cell type density alterations in ASD brains are indicated because distributions of these cell type markers are shifted concordantly. Importantly, orthologous mouse neuronal marker genes encoding proteins localized to diverse neuronal compartments all showed reduced median expression in ASD. Our results provide a framework for revealing the basis of transcriptomic differences in ASD. We propose comparing cell type density alterations in post-mortem tissue with and without these distinctive gene expression changes to reconcile results from stereological and transcriptomic studies."

10.1101/032540,"Animals rely on highly sensitive thermoreceptors to seek out optimal temperatures, but the molecular mechanisms of thermosensing are not well understood. The Dorsal Organ Cool Cells (DOCCs) of the Drosophila larva are a set of exceptionally thermosensitive neurons critical for larval cool avoidance. Here we show that DOCC cool-sensing is mediated by Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), a family of sensory receptors widely studied in invertebrate chemical sensing. We find that two IRs, IR21a and IR25a, are required to mediate DOCC responses to cooling and are required for cool avoidance behavior. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of IR21a can confer cool-responsiveness in an Ir25a-dependent manner, suggesting an instructive role for IR21a in thermosensing. Together, these data show that IR family receptors can function together to mediate thermosensation of exquisite sensitivity."
10.1101/032581,"Double-strand DNA breaks occur upon exposure of cells to agents such as ionizing radiation and ultraviolet light or indirectly through replication fork collapse at DNA damage sites. If left unrepaired double-strand breaks can cause genome instability and cell death. In response to DNA damage, proteins involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination re-localize into discrete nuclear foci. We identified 29 proteins that co-localize with the recombination repair protein Rad52 in response to DNA damage. Of particular interest, Ygr042w/Mte1, a protein of unknown function, showed robust colocalization with Rad52. Mte1 foci fail to form when the DNA helicase Mph1 is absent. Mte1 and Mph1 form a complex, and are recruited to double-strand breaks in vivo in a mutually dependent manner. Mte1 is important for resolution of Rad52 foci during double-strand break repair, and for suppressing break-induced replication. Together our data indicate that Mte1 functions with Mph1 in double-strand break repair."
10.1101/032607,"G proteins are an important family of signalling molecules controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity in what is commonly called an  activation/inactivation cycle. The molecular mechanism by which guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) catalyse the activation of monomeric G proteins is well-established, however the complete reversibility of this mechanism is often overlooked. Here, we use a theoretical approach to prove that GEFs are unable to positively control G protein systems at steady-state in the absence of GTPase activity. Instead, positive regulation of G proteins must be seen as a product of the competition between guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity - emphasising a central role for GTPase activity beyond merely signal termination. We conclude that a more accurate description of the regulation of G proteins via these processes is as a  balance/imbalance mechanism. This result has implications for the understanding of many intracellular signalling processes, and for experimental strategies that rely on modulating G protein systems."
10.1101/032615,"Many studies show that short non-coding sequences are widely conserved among regulatory elements. More and more conserved sequences are being discovered since the development next generation sequencing technology. A common approach to identify conserved sequences with regulatory roles rely on the topological change such as hairpin formation on the DNA or RNA level. However, G-quadruplexes, a non-cannonical nucleic acid topology with little established biological role, is rarely considered for conserved regulatory element discovery. Here we present the use of G-quadruplex prediction algorithm to identify putative G-quadruplex-forming and conserved elements in E.coli genome. Phylogenetic analysis of 52 G-quadruplex forming sequences revealed two conserved G-quadruplex motifs with potential regulatory role."
10.1101/032649,"Introduction Introduction Materials and Methods Dissections and Measurements Results Discussion References Females in many species mate more than once and store sperm from more than one male. This leads to post-copulatory competition where sperm from different males compete to fertilize the limited number of eggs produced by the female-typically called Sperm competition (Parker, 1970a) (Wedell et al., 2002). Sperm competition and the resulting post-copulatory selection can significantly alter male reproductive behavior (Simmons et al., 1993) (Cook & Wedell, 1996) (Gage and Barnard, 1996) (Wedell & Cook 1999a,b) (Bretman et al., 2009) (Bretman et al., 2010) ( ..."
10.1101/032623,"Human scene recognition is a rapid multistep process evolving over time from single scene image to spatial layout processing. We used multivariate pattern analyses on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to unravel the time course of this cortical process. Following an early signal for lower-level visual analysis of single scenes at ~100ms, we found a marker of real-world scene size, i.e. spatial layout processing, at ~250ms indexing neural representations robust to changes in unrelated scene properties and viewing conditions. For a quantitative explanation that captures the complexity of scene recognition, we compared MEG data to a deep neural network model trained on scene classification. Representations of scene size emerged intrinsically in the model, and resolved emerging neural scene size representation. Together our data provide a first description of an electrophysiological signal for layout processing in humans, and a novel quantitative model of how spatial layout representations may emerge in the human brain."
10.1101/032680,"The cell types that trigger the primary pathology in many brain diseases remain largely unknown. One route to understanding the primary pathological cell type for a particular disease is to identify the cells expressing susceptibility genes. Although this is straightforward for monogenic conditions where the causative mutation may alter expression of a cell type specific marker, methods are required for the common polygenic disorders. We developed the Expression Weighted Cell Type Enrichment (EWCE) method that uses single cell transcriptomes to generate the probability distribution associated with a gene list having an average level of expression within a cell type. Following validation, we applied EWCE to human genetic data from cases of epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Autism, Intellectual Disability, Alzheimers disease, Multiple Sclerosis and anxiety disorders. Genetic susceptibility primarily affected microglia in Alzheimers and Multiple Sclerosis; was shared between interneurons and pyramidal neurons in Autism and Schizophrenia; while intellectual disabilities and epilepsy were attributable to a range of cell-types, with the strongest enrichment in interneurons. We hypothesized that the primary cell type pathology could trigger secondary changes in other cell types and these could be detected by applying EWCE to transcriptome data from diseased tissue. In Autism, Schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease we find evidence of pathological changes in all of the major brain cell types. These findings give novel insight into the cellular origins and progression in common brain disorders. The methods can be applied to any tissue and disorder and have applications in validating mouse models."
10.1101/032805,"Two broad paradigms exist for inferring dN/dS, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates, from coding sequences: i) a one-rate approach, where dN/dS is represented with a single parameter, or ii) a two-rate approach, where dN and dS are estimated separately. The performances of these two approaches have been well-studied in the specific context of proper model specification, i.e. when the inference model matches the simulation model. By contrast, the relative performances of one-rate vs. two-rate parameterizations when applied to data generated according to a different mechanism remains unclear. Here, we compare the relative merits of one-rate and two-rate approaches in the specific context of model misspecification by simulating alignments with mutation-selection models rather than with dN/dS-based models. We find that one-rate frameworks generally infer more accurate dN/dS point estimates, even when dS varies among sites. In other words, modeling dS variation may substantially reduce accuracy of dN/dS point estimates. These results appear to depend on the selective constraint operating at a given site. In particular, for sites under strong purifying selection (dN/dS<~0.3), one-rate and two-rate models show comparable performances. However, one-rate models significantly outperform two-rate models for sites under moderate-to-weak purifying selection. We attribute this distinction to the fact that, for these more quickly evolving sites, a given substitution is more likely to be nonsynonymous than synonymous. The data will therefore be relatively enriched for nonsynonymous changes, and modeling dS contributes excessive noise to dN/dS estimates. We additionally find that high levels of divergence among sequences, rather than the number of sequences in the alignment, are more critical for obtaining precise point estimates."
10.1101/032748,"Many theories have been proposed attempting to explain the origin of the genetic code. While strong reasons remain to believe that the genetic code evolved as a frozen accident, at least for the first few amino acids, other theories remain viable. In this work, we test the optimality of the standard genetic code against approximately 17 million genetic codes, and locate 18 which outperform the standard genetic code at the following three criteria: (a) robustness to point mutation; (b) robustness to frameshift mutation; and (c) ability to encode additional information in the coding region. We use a genetic algorithm to generate and score codes from different parts of the associated landscape, and are, as a result presumably more representative of the entire landscape. Our results show that while the genetic code is sub-optimal for robustness to frameshift mutation and the ability to encode additional information in the coding region, it is very strongly selected for robustness to point mutation. This coupled with the observation that the different performance indicator scores for a particular genetic code are seemingly negatively correlated, make the standard genetic code nearly optimal for the three criteria tested in this work."
10.1101/032813,"Somatic tissue evolves over a vertebrates lifetime due to the accumulation of mutations in stem cell populations. Mutations may alter cellular fitness and contribute to tumorigenesis or aging. The distribution of mutational effects within somatic cells is not known. Given the unique regulatory regime of somatic cell division we hypothesize that mutational effects in somatic tissue fall into a different framework than whole organisms; one in which there are more mutations of large effect. Through simulation analysis we investigate the fit of tumor incidence curves generated using exponential and power law Distributions of Fitness Effects (DFE) to known tumorigenesis incidence. Modeling considerations include the architecture of stem cell populations, i.e., a large number of very small populations, and mutations that do and do not fix neutrally in the stem cell niche. We find that the typically quantified DFE in whole organisms is sufficient to explain tumorigenesis incidence. Further, due to the effects of small stem cell population sizes, i.e., strong genetic drift, deleterious mutations are predicted to accumulate, resulting in reduced tissue maintenance. Thus, despite there being a large number of stem cells throughout the intestine, its compartmental architecture leads to significant aging, a prime example of Mullers Ratchet."
10.1101/031492,"Estimation of heritability is fundamental in genetic studies. In recent years, heritability estimation using linear mixed models (LMMs) has gained popularity, because these estimates can be obtained from unrelated individuals collected in genome wide association studies. Typically, heritability estimation under LMMs uses either the maximum likelihood (ML) or the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach. Existing methods for the construction of confidence intervals and estimators of standard errors for both ML and REML rely on asymptotic properties. However, these assumptions are often violated due to the bounded parameter space, statistical dependencies, and limited sample size, leading to biased estimates, and inflated or deflated confidence intervals. Here, we show that often the probability that the genetic component is estimated as zero is high even when the true heritability is bounded away from zero, emphasizing the need for accurate confidence intervals. We further show that the estimation of confidence intervals by state-of-the-art methods is highly inaccurate, especially when the true heritability is either relatively low or relatively high. Such biases are present, for example, in estimates of heritability of gene expression in the GTEx study, and of lipid profiles in the LURIC study. We propose a computationally efficient method, Accurate LMM-Based confidence Intervals (ALBI), for the estimation of the distribution of the heritability estimator, and for the construction of accurate confidence intervals. Our method can be used as an add-on to existing methods for heritability and variance components estimation, such as GCTA, FaST-LMM, GEMMA, or EMMA. ALBI is available at http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~heran/cozygene/software/albi.html."
10.1101/032789,"We conducted a genome-wide association study of subjective well-being (SWB) in 298,420 individuals. We also performed auxiliary analyses of depressive symptoms (\""DS\""; N = 161,460) and neuroticism (N = 170,910), both of which have a substantial genetic correlation with SWB [Formula]. We identify three SNPs associated with SWB at genome-wide significance. Two of them are significantly associated with DS in an independent sample. In our auxiliary analyses, we identify 13 additional genome-wide-significant associations: two with DS and eleven with neuroticism, including two inversion polymorphisms. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal/pancreas tissues are enriched. The discovery of genetic loci associated with the three phenotypes we study has proven elusive; our findings illustrate the payoffs from studying them jointly.\n\nOne Sentence Summary: Using both genome-wide association studies and proxy-phenotype studies, we identify genetic variants associated with subjective well-being, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism."
10.1101/032656,"Every human cognitive function, such as visual object recognition, is realized in a complex spatio-temporal activity pattern in the brain. Current brain imaging techniques in isolation cannot resolve the brains spatio-temporal dynamics because they provide either high spatial or temporal resolution but not both. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new integration approach that uses representational similarities to combine measurements from different imaging modalities - magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) - to yield a spatially and temporally integrated characterization of neuronal activation. Applying this approach to two independent MEG-fMRI data sets, we observed that neural activity first emerged in the occipital pole at 50-80ms, before spreading rapidly and progressively in the anterior direction along the ventral and dorsal visual streams. These results provide a novel and comprehensive, spatio-temporally resolved view of the rapid neural dynamics during the first few hundred milliseconds of object vision. They further demonstrate the feasibility of spatially unbiased representational similarity based fusion of MEG and fMRI, promising new insights into how the brain computes complex cognitive functions."
10.1101/032664,"Sexual antagonism (SA) arises when male and female phenotypes are under opposing selection, yet genetically correlated. Until resolved, antagonism limits evolution towards optimal sex-specific phenotypes. Despite its importance for sex-specific adaptation and existing theory, the dynamics of SA resolution are not well understood empirically. Here, we present data from Drosophila melanogaster, compatible with a resolution of SA. We compared two independent replicates of the  LHM population in which SA had previously been described. Both had been maintained under identical, controlled conditions, and separated for <250 generations. Although heritabilities of male and female fitness were similar, the inter-sexual genetic correlation differed significantly, being negative in one replicate (indicating SA) but close to zero in the other. Using population sequencing, we show that phenotypic differences were associated with population divergence in allele frequencies at non-random loci across the genome. Large frequency changes were more prevalent in the population without SA and were enriched at loci mapping to genes previously shown to have a sexually antagonistic relationships between expression and fitness. Our data suggest that rapid evolution towards SA resolution has occurred in one of the populations and open avenues towards studying the genetics of SA and its resolution."
10.1101/032755,"1. Large-scale species occurrence data from geo-referenced observations and collected specimens are crucial for analyses in ecology, evolution and biogeography. Despite the rapidly growing availability of such data, their use in evolutionary analyses is often hampered by tedious manual classification of point occurrences into operational areas, leading to a lack of reproducibility and concerns regarding data quality.\n\n2. Here we present speciesgeocodeR, a user-friendly R-package for data cleaning, data exploration and data visualization of species point occurrences using discrete operational areas, and linking them to analyses invoking phylogenetic trees.\n\n3. The three core functions of the package are 1) automated and reproducible data cleaning, 2) rapid and reproducible classification of point occurrences into discrete operational areas in an adequate format for subsequent biogeographic analyses, and 3) a comprehensive summary and visualization of species distributions to explore large datasets and ensure data quality. In addition, speciesgeocodeR facilitates the access and analysis of publicly available species occurrence data, widely used operational areas and elevation ranges.

10.1101/032862,"Understanding the relationship between variations in DNA methylation and gene expression has been challenging. Evidence suggests the function of DNA methylation may vary with genomic context, and few consistent rules linking methylation to expression have been noted. For array-based studies, the content of current DNA methylation array platforms provide broad coverage of the genome but target only a fraction of the potentially methylated CG dinucleotides. A better understanding of the interplay between DNA methylation and gene expression is beneficial for users of these platforms, and may aid with candidate prioritization in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). To address this we examined the relationship between DNA methylation levels and gene expression in primary T-lymphocytes at discreet genomic regions around the transcriptional unit (Promoters, gene body, untranslated regions) and at CpG island-associated regions (islands, shores and shelves), stratifying by high and low expressed genes. As anticipated we found evidence that DNA methylation at CpG sites near promoter regions are tightly correlated with gene expression in both the stably expressed and developmentally regulated genes, however this is dependent on CpG density. DNA methylation within the gene body was not consistently associated with changes in gene expression. CpG islands and island shores exhibited strong correlations with gene expression, but this was not true for island shelves. We found these relationships were generally preserved at both dynamic and steady state genes, with some notable exceptions. In combination these insights may be useful for prioritising candidates identified in epigenome-wide association studies for subsequent functional studies."
10.1101/032839,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infections were more common in the zoonotic cycle until the end of the 20th century with few human cases in Africa and Southeastern Asia. Recently, the Asian lineage of ZIKV is spreading along human-to-human chains of transmission in the Pacific Islands and in South America. To better understand its recent urban expansion, we compared genetic differences among the lineages. Herein we show that the recent Asian lineage spread is associated with significant NS1 codon usage adaptation to human housekeeping genes, which could facilitate viral replication and increase viral titers. These findings were supported by a significant correlation with growth in Malthusian fitness. Furthermore, we predicted several epitopes in the NS1 protein that are shared between ZIKV and Dengue. Our results imply in a significant dependence of the recent human ZIKV spread on NS1 translational selection."
10.1101/032904,"Beta and gamma rhythms have been hypothesized to be involved in global and local coordination of neuronal activity, respectively. Here, we investigated how cells in rodent area S1BF are entrained by rhythmic fluctuations at various frequencies within the local area and in connected areas, and how this depends on behavioral state and cell type. We performed simultaneous extracellular field and unit recordings in four connected areas of the freely moving rat (S1BF, V1M, perirhinal cortex, CA1). S1BF spiking activity was strongly entrained by both beta and gamma S1BF oscillations, which were associated with deactivations and activations, respectively. We identified multiple classes of fast spiking and excitatory cells in S1BF, which showed prominent differences in rhythmic entrainment and in the extent to which phase locking was modulated by behavioral state. Using an additional dataset acquired by whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice, these cell classes could be compared with identified phenotypes showing gamma rhythmicity in their membrane potential. We next examined how S1BF cells were entrained by rhythmic fluctuations in connected brain areas. Gamma-synchronization was detected in all four areas, however we did not detect significant gamma coherence among these areas. Instead, we only found long-range coherence in the theta-beta range among these areas. In contrast to local S1BF synchronization, we found long-range S1BF-spike to CA1-LFP synchronization to be homogeneous across inhibitory and excitatory cell types. These findings suggest distinct, cell-type contributions of low and high-frequency synchronization to intra- and inter-areal neuronal interactions."
10.1101/032847,"Intrinsically disordered proteins fail to adopt a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. It is now understood that many disordered proteins are not dysfunctional, but instead engage in numerous cellular processes, including signaling and regulation. Disorder characterization from amino acid sequence relies on computational disorder prediction algorithms. While numerous large-scale investigations of disorder have been performed using these algorithms, and have offered valuable insight regarding the prevalence of protein disorder in many organisms, critical proteome-based descriptive statistical guidelines that would enable the objective assessment of intrinsic disorder in a protein of interest remain to be established. Here we present a quantitative characterization of numerous disorder features using a rigorous non-parametric statistical approach, providing expected values and percentile cutoffs for each feature in ten eukaryotic proteomes. Our estimates utilize multiple ab initio disorder prediction algorithms grounded on physicochemical principles. Furthermore, we present novel threshold values, specific to both the prediction algorithms and the proteomes, defining the longest primary sequence length in which the significance of a continuous disordered region can be evaluated on the basis of length alone. The guidelines presented here are intended to improve the interpretation of disorder content and continuous disorder predictions from the proteomic point of view."
10.1101/032185,"Background: Many different methods exist to adjust for variability in cell-type mixture proportions when analyzing DNA methylation studies. Here we present the result of an extensive simulation study, built on cell-separated DNA methylation profiles from Illumina Infinium 450K methylation data, to compare the performance of 8 methods including the most commonly-used approaches. Results: We designed a rich multi-layered simulation containing a set of probes with true associations with either binary or continuous phenotypes, confounding by cell type, variability in means and standard deviations for population parameter, additional variability at the level of an individual cell-type-specific sample, and variability in the mixture proportions across samples. Performance varied quite substantially across methods and simulations. In particular, the false discovery rates (FDR) were sometimes unrealistically high, indicating limited ability to discriminate the true signals from those appearing significant through confounding. Methods that filtered probes had consequently poor power. QQ-plots of p-values across all tested probes showed that adjustments did not always improve the distribution. The same methods were used to examine associations between smoking and methylation data from a case-control study of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: We recommend surrogate variable analysis for cell-type mixture adjustment since performance was stable under all our simulated scenarios."
10.1101/032763,"Farming and sedentism first appear in southwest Asia during the early Holocene and later spread to neighboring regions, including Europe, along multiple dispersal routes. Conspicuous uncertainties remain about the relative roles of migration, cultural diffusion and admixture with local foragers in the early Neolithisation of Europe. Here we present paleogenomic data for five Neolithic individuals from northwestern Turkey and northern Greece - spanning the time and region of the earliest spread of farming into Europe. We observe striking genetic similarity both among Aegean early farmers and with those from across Europe. Our study demonstrates a direct genetic link between Mediterranean and Central European early farmers and those of Greece and Anatolia, extending the European Neolithic migratory chain all the way back to southwestern Asia."
10.1101/032870,"Obtaining high-quality samples from wild animals is a major obstacle for genomic studies of many taxa, particular at the population level, as collection methods for such samples are typically invasive. DNA from feces is easy to obtain noninvasively, but is dominated by a preponderance of bacterial and other non-host DNA. Because next-generation sequencing technology sequences DNA largely indiscriminately, the high proportion of exogenous DNA drastically reduces the efficiency of high-throughput sequencing for host animal genomics. In order to address this issue, we developed an inexpensive methylation-based capture method for enriching host DNA from noninvasively obtained fecal DNA samples. Our method exploits natural differences in CpG-methylation density between vertebrate and bacterial genomes to preferentially bind and isolate host DNA from majority-bacterial fecal DNA samples. We demonstrate that the enrichment is robust, efficient, and compatible with downstream library preparation methods useful for population studies (e.g., RADseq). Compared to other enrichment strategies, our method is quick and inexpensive, adding only a negligible cost to sample preparation for research that is often severely constrained by budgetary limitations. In combination with downstream methods such as RADseq, our approach allows for cost-effective and customizable genomic-scale genotyping that was previously feasible in practice only with invasive samples. Because feces are widely available and convenient to collect, our method empowers researchers to explore genomic-scale population-level questions in organisms for which invasive sampling is challenging or undesirable."
10.1101/032995,"During normal organ development, the progenitor cell state is transient: it depends on specific combinations of transcription factors and extracellular signals, that cooperate to sustain the proliferative potential and undifferentiated status of organ progenitor cells. Not surprisingly, abnormal maintenance of progenitor transcription factors may lead to tissue overgrowth, and the concurrence of specific signals from the local environment is often critical to trigger this overgrowth. Therefore, the identification of the specific combinations of transcription factors and signals that promote or oppose proliferation in progenitor cells is essential to understand normal development and disease. We have investigated this issue by asking what signals may promote the proliferation of eye progenitors in Drosophila. Two transcription factors, the MEIS1 homologue homothorax (hth) and the Zn-finger teashirt (tsh) are transiently expressed in eye progenitors causing the expansion of the progenitor pool. However, if their co-expression is maintained experimentally, cell proliferation continues and differentiation is halted. Here we show that Hth+Tsh-induced tissue overgrowth requires the BMP2 ligand Dpp and the activation of its pathway. In Hth+Tsh cells, the Dpp pathway is abnormally hyperactivated. Rather than using autocrine Dpp expression, Hth+Tsh cells increase their avidity for Dpp, produced locally, by upregulating extracellular matrix components. During normal development, Dpp represses hth and tsh ensuring that the progenitor state is transient. However, cells in which Hth+Tsh expression is maintained use Dpp to enhance their proliferation.\n\nSummary StatementIn Drosophila, homothorax, the Meis1 homologue, and teashirt jointly sustain the proliferation of eye progenitor cells by increasing their avidity for BMP produced by the local microenvironment."

To address this question in a dynamic system, we mapped the proteomics and transcriptomics changes in mammalian cells responding to stress induced by dithiothreitol over 30 hours. Specifically, we estimated the kinetic parameters for synthesis and degradation of RNA and proteins, and deconvoluted response patterns common and unique to each regulatory level using a new statistical tool. Overall, both regulatory levels were equally important, but differed in their impact on molecule concentrations. Both mRNA and protein changes peaked between two and eight hours, but mRNA expression fold changes were much smaller than those of the proteins. Further, mRNA concentrations were regulated in a transient, spike-like pattern and returned to values close to pre-treatment levels by the end of the experiment. In contrast, protein concentrations switched only once and established a new steady state, consistent with the dominant role of protein regulation during misfolding stress. Finally, we generated hypotheses on specific regulatory modes for example groups of genes."

10.1101/032912,"This study examines how processes such as reward/aversion and attention, which are often studied as independent processes, in fact interact at a systems level. We operationalize attention with a continuous performance task and variables from signal detection theory, and reward/aversion with a keypress task using variables from relative preference theory. We find that while the relationship between reward/aversion and attention is functionally invariant, a power law formulation akin to the Cobb-Douglas production function in economics provides the best model fit and theoretical explanation for the interaction. These results indicate that a decreasing signal-to-noise with signal detection results in higher loss aversion. Furthermore, the estimated exponents for the multiplicative power law suggest capacity constraints to processing for attention and reward/aversion. These results demonstrate a systemic interaction of attention and reward/aversion across subjects, with a quantitative schema raising the hypothesis that mechanistic inference may be possible at the level of behavior alone."
10.1101/032979,"How urbanization shapes population genomic diversity and evolution of urban wildlife is largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of urbanization on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in the New York City metropolitan area using coalescent-based simulations to infer demographic history from the site frequency spectrum. We assigned individuals to evolutionary clusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes, and migration using genome-wide SNPs genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modeling indicates that post-glacial sea level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently-isolated P. leucopus populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in New York City."
10.1101/032714,"Bacterial biofilms are a significant medical challenge as they are recalcitrant to current therapeutic regimes. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. Given that the glycoside hydrolases - PelAh and PslGh - encoded in the pel and psl biosynthetic operons, respectively, are utilized for in vivo exopolysaccharide processing, we reasoned that these would provide specificity to target P. aeruginosa biofilms. Evaluating these enzymes as potential therapeutics, we demonstrate that these glycoside hydrolases selectively target and degrade the exopolysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix and that nanomolar concentrations of these enzymes can both prevent biofilm formation as well as rapidly disrupt preexisting biofilms in vitro. This treatment was effective against clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates and reduced biofilm biomass by 58-94%. These non-cytotoxic enzymes potentiated antibiotics as the addition of either enzyme to a sub-lethal concentration of colistin reduced viable bacterial counts by 2.5 orders of magnitude. Additionally, PelAh was able to increase neutrophil killing by ~50%. This work illustrates the feasibility and benefits of using bacterial exopolysaccharide biosynthetic glycoside hydrolases and synthetic biology to develop novel anti-biofilm therapeutics."
10.1101/032987,"We have become increasingly aware that during infection, pathogenic bacteria often grow in multicellular biofilms which are often highly resistant to antibacterial strategies. In order to understand how biofilms form and contribute to infection, in vitro biofilm systems such as microtitre plate assays and flow cells, have been heavily used by many research groups around the world. Whilst these methods have greatly increased our understanding of the biology of biofilms, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many of our in vitro methods do not accurately represent in vivo conditions. Here we present a systematic review of the most widely used in vitro biofilm systems, and we discuss why they are not always representative of the in vivo biofilms found in chronic infections. We present examples of methods that will help us to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo biofilm work, so that our bench-side data can ultimately be used to improve bedside treatment."
10.1101/033027,"Opsins are photosensitive proteins catalyzing light-dependent processes across the tree of life. For both microbial (type 1) and metazoan (type 2) opsins, photosensing depends upon covalent interaction between a retinal chromophore and a conserved lysine residue. Despite recent discoveries of potential opsin homologs lacking this residue, phylogenetic dispersal and functional significance of these abnormal sequences have not yet been investigated. We report discovery of a large group of putatively non-retinal binding opsins, present in a number of fungal and microbial genomes and comprising nearly 30% of opsins in the Halobacteriacea, a model clade for opsin photobiology. Based on phylogenetic analyses, structural modeling, genomic context and biochemistry, we propose that these abnormal opsin homologs represent a novel family of sensory opsins which may be involved in taxis response to one or more non-light stimuli. This finding challenges current understanding of microbial opsins as a light-specific sensory family, and provides a potential analogy with the highly diverse signaling capabilities of the eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), of which metazoan type 2 opsins are a light-specific sub-clade."
10.1101/032946,"Computational methods for Target Fishing (TF), also known as Target Prediction or Polypharmacology Prediction, can be used to discover new targets in small-molecule drugs. This may result in repositioning the drug in a new indication or improving our current understanding of its efficacy and side effects. While there is a substantial body of research on TF methods, there is still a need to improve their validation, which is often limited to a small part of the available targets and not easily interpretable by the user. Here we discuss how target-centric TF methods are inherently limited by the number of targets that can possibly predict (this number is by construction much larger in ligand-centric techniques). We also propose a new benchmark to validate TF methods, which is particularly suited to analyse how predictive performance varies with the query molecule. On average over approved drugs, we estimate that only five predicted targets will have to be tested to find two true targets with submicromolar potency (a strong variability in performance is however observed). In addition, we find that an approved drug has currently an average of eight known targets, which reinforces the notion that polypharmacology is a common and strong event. Furthermore, with the assistance of a control group of randomly-selected molecules, we show that the targets of approved drugs are generally harder to predict."
10.1101/032953,"Recent studies involving the 3-dimensional conformation of chromatin have revealed the important role it has to play in different processes within the cell. These studies have also led to the discovery of densely interacting segments of the chromosome, called topologically associating domains. The accurate identification of these domains from Hi-C interaction data is an interesting and important computational problem for which numerous methods have been proposed. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms designed to identify these domains assume that they are non-overlapping whereas there is substantial evidence to believe a nested structure exists. We present an efficient methodology to predict hierarchical chromatin domains using chromatin conformation capture data. Our method predicts domains at different resolutions and uses these to construct a hierarchy that is based on intrinsic properties of the chromatin data. The hierarchy consists of a set of non-overlapping domains, that maximize intra-domain interaction frequencies, at each level. We show that our predicted structure is highly enriched for CTCF and various other chromatin markers. We also show that large-scale domains, at multiple resolutions within our hierarchy, are conserved across cell types and species.

10.1101/033019,"SummaryCurrent genome assemblies consist of thousands of contigs. These incomplete and fragmented assemblies lead to errors in gene identification, such that single genes spread across multiple contigs are annotated as separate gene models. We present AGOUTI (Annotated Genome Optimization Using Transcriptome Information), a tool that uses RNA-seq data to simultaneously combine contigs into scaffolds and fragmented gene models into single models. We show that AGOUTI improves both the contiguity of genome assemblies and the accuracy of gene annotation, providing updated versions of each as output.\n\nAvailabilityThe software is implemented in python and is available from github.com/svm-zhang/AGOUTI.\n\nContactsimozhan@indiana.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
10.1101/032938,"Phylogeny-based and functional trait-based analyses are two principle ways to study community assembly and underlying ecological processes. In principle, knowing all information about species traits would make phylogenetic information redundant, at least that component of phylogenetic signal in the distribution of species among communities that is caused by phylogenetically related species sharing similar traits. In reality, phylogenies may contain more information than a set of singular, discretely measured traits because we cannot measure all species traits and may misjudge which are most important. The extent to which functional trait information makes phylogenetic information redundant, however, has not been explicitly studied with empirical data in community ecology. Here, we use phylogenetic linear mixed models to analyze community assembly of 55 understory plant species in 30 forest sites in central Wisconsin. These communities show strong phylogenetic attraction, yet variation among sites in 20 environmental variables could not account for this pattern. Most of the 15 functional traits we measured had strong phylogenetic signal, but only three varied strongly among sites in ways that affected species abundances. These three traits explained only 19% of variation in phylogenetic patterns of species co-occurrence. Thus, phylogenies appear to provide considerably more information about community assembly than the functional traits measured in this study, demonstrating the value of phylogeny in studying of community assembly processes even with abundant functional traits."
10.1101/032920,"Deletions, commonly referred to as deficiencies by Drosophila geneticists, are valuable tools for mapping genes and for genetic pathway discovery via dose-dependent suppressor and enhancer screens. More recently, it has become clear that deviations from normal gene dosage are associated with multiple disorders in a range of species including humans. While we are beginning to understand some of the transcriptional effects brought about by gene dosage changes and the chromosome rearrangement breakpoints associated with them, much of this work relies on isolated examples. We have systematically examined deficiencies on the left arm of chromosome 2 and characterize gene-by-gene dosage responses that vary from collapsed expression through modest partial dosage compensation to full or even over compensation. We found negligible long-range effects of creating novel chromosome domains at deletion breakpoints, suggesting that cases of changes in gene regulation due to altered nuclear architecture are rare. These rare cases include trans de-repression when deficiencies delete chromatin characterized as repressive in other studies. Generally, effects of breakpoints on expression are promoter proximal (~100 bp) or within the gene body. Genome-wide effects of deficiencies are observed at genes with regulatory relationships to genes within the deleted segments, highlighting the subtle expression network defects in these sensitized genetic backgrounds.\n\nAuthor summaryDeletions alter gene dose in heterozygotes and bring distant regions of the genome into juxtaposition. We find that the transcriptional dose response is generally varied, gene-specific, and coherently propagates into gene expression regulatory networks. Analysis of deletion heterozygote expression profiles indicates that distinct genetic pathways are weakened in adult flies bearing different deletions even though they show minimal or no overt phenotypes. While there are exceptions, breakpoints have a minimal effect on the expression of flanking genes, despite the fact that different regions of the genome are brought into contact and that important elements such as insulators are deleted. These data suggest that there is little effect of nuclear architecture and long-range enhancer and/or silencer promoter contact on gene expression in the compact Drosophila genome."
10.1101/033001,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a general mechanism of transcript diversification in mammals, which has been recently linked to proliferative states and cancer. Different 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) isoforms interact with different RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which modify the stability, translation, and subcellular localization of the corresponding transcripts. Although the heterogeneity of pre-mRNA 3 end processing has been established with high-throughput approaches, the mechanisms that underlie systematic changes in 3 UTR lengths remain to be characterized. Through a uniform analysis of a large number of 3 end sequencing data sets we have uncovered 18 signals, 6 of which novel, whose positioning with respect to pre-mRNA cleavage sites indicates a role in pre-mRNA 3 end processing in both mouse and human. With 3 end sequencing we have demonstrated that the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), which binds the poly(U) motif whose frequency also peaks in the vicinity of polyadenylation (poly(A)) sites, has a genome-wide effect on poly(A) site usage. HNRNPC-regulated 3 UTRs are enriched in ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1) binding sites and include those of the CD47 molecule (CD47) gene, which participate in the recently discovered mechanism of 3 UTR-dependent protein localization (UDPL). Our study thus establishes an up-to-date, high-confidence catalog of 3 end processing sites and poly(A) signals and it uncovers an important role of HNRNPC in regulating 3 end processing. It further suggests that U-rich elements mediate interactions with multiple RBPs that regulate different stages in a transcripts life cycle."
10.1101/033050,"Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host-parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not."
10.1101/033142,"The dramatic drop in DNA sequencing costs has created many opportunities for novel biological research. These opportunities largely rest upon the ability to effectively compare newly obtained and previously known sequences. This is commonly done with BLAST, yet using BLAST directly on new datasets requires substantial technical skills or helpful colleagues. Furthermore, graphical interfaces for BLAST are challenging to install and largely mimic underlying computational processes rather than work patterns of researchers.\n\nWe combined a user-centric design philosophy with sustainable software development approaches to create Sequenceserver (http://sequenceserver.com), a modern graphical user interface for BLAST. Sequenceserver substantially increases the efficiency of researchers working with sequence data. This is due to innovations at three levels. First, our software can be installed and used on custom datasets extremely rapidly for personal and shared applications. Second, based on analysis of user input and simple algorithms, Sequenceserver reduces the amount of decisions the user must make, provides interactive visual feedback, and prevents common potential errors that would otherwise cause erroneous results. Finally, Sequenceserver provides multiple highly visual and text-based output options that mirror the requirements and work patterns of researchers. Together, these features greatly facilitate BLAST analysis and interpretation and thus substantially enhance researcher productivity."
10.1101/033159,"Biological organisms have evolved a wide range of immune mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. Beyond molecular details, these mechanisms differ in how protection is acquired, processed and passed on to subsequent generations - differences that may be essential to long-term survival. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework to compare the long-term adaptation of populations as a function of the pathogen dynamics that they experience and of the immune strategy that they adopt. We find that the two key determinants of an optimal immune strategy are the frequency and the characteristic timescale of the pathogens. Depending on these two parameters, our framework identifies distinct modes of immunity, including adaptive, innate, bet-hedging and CRISPR-like immunities, which recapitulate the diversity of natural immune systems."
10.1101/033076,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has undergone extensive intron loss during its evolutionary history. It has been suggested that the few remaining introns (in only 5% of protein-coding genes) are retained because of their impact on function under stress conditions. Here, we explore the possibility that novel non-coding RNA structures (ncRNAs) are embedded within intronic sequences and are contributing to phenotype and intron retention in yeast. We employed de novo RNA structure prediction tools to screen intronic sequences in S. cerevisiae and 36 other fungi. We identified and validated 19 new intronic RNAs via RNAseq and RT-PCR. Contrary to common belief that excised introns are rapidly degraded, we found that, in six cases, the excised introns were maintained intact in the cells. In other two cases we showed that the ncRNAs were further processed from their introns. RNAseq analysis confirmed higher expression of introns in the ribosomial protein genes containing predicted RNA structures. We deleted the novel intronic RNA structure within the GLC7 intron and showed that this predicted ncRNA, rather than the intron itself, is responsible for the cells ability to respond to salt stress. We also showed a direct association between the presence of the intronic ncRNA and GLC7 expression. Overall, these data support the notion that some introns may have been maintained in the genome because they harbour functional ncRNAs."
10.1101/033092,"BackgroundOncology drugs are only effective in a small proportion of cancer patients. Our current ability to identify these responsive patients before treatment is still poor in most cases. Thus, there is a pressing need to discover response markers for marketed and research oncology drugs in order to improve patient survival, reduce healthcare costs and enhance success rates in clinical trials. Screening these drugs against a large panel of cancer cell lines has been employed to discover new genomic markers of in vitro drug response, which can now be further evaluated on more accurate tumour models. However, while the identification of discriminative markers among thousands of candidate drug-gene associations in the data is error-prone, an appraisal of the effectiveness of such detection task is currently lacking.\n\nResultsHere we present a new non-parametric method to measuring the discriminative power of a drug-gene association. This is enabled by the identification of an auxiliary threshold posing this task as a binary classification problem. Unlike parametric statistical tests, the adopted non-parametric test has the advantage of not making strong assumptions about the data distorting the identification of genomic markers. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to further validate these markers in vitro using more recent data not used to identify the markers. The application of this new methodology has led to the identification of 128 new genomic markers distributed across 61% of the analysed drugs, including 5 drugs without previously known markers, which were missed by the MANOVA test initially applied to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer consortium.\n\nAbbreviation"
10.1101/033167,"Studying the molecular consequences of rare genetic variants has the potential of identifying novel and hereto uncharacterized pathways causally contributing to phenotypic variation. Here we characterize the functional consequences of a rare coding variant of TAO3, previously reported to significantly contribute to sporulation efficiency variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During mitosis TAO3 interacts with CBK1, a conserved NDR kinase and a component of RAM network. The RAM network genes are involved in regulation cell separation and polarization. We demonstrate that the role of the rare allele TAO3(4477C) in meiosis is distinct from its role in mitosis by being independent of ACE2, which is a RAM network target gene. By quantitatively measuring cell morphological dynamics and conditionally expressing TAO3(4477C) allele during sporulation, we show that TAO3 has an early role in meiosis. This early role of TAO3 coincides with entry of cells into meiotic division. Time-resolved transcriptome analyses during early sporulation phase identified regulators of carbon and lipid metabolic pathways as candidate mediators. We experimentally show that during sporulation the TAO3 allele genetically interacts with ERT1 and PIP2, the regulators of tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenic enzymes, respectively. We thus uncover meiotic functions of TAO3, a mitotic gene and propose ERT1 and PIP2 as novel regulators of sporulation efficiency. Our results demonstrate that study of causal effects of genetic variation on the underlying molecular network has the potential to provide more extensive comprehension of the pathways driving a complex trait. This can help identify prospective personalized targets for intervention in complex diseases."
10.1101/033068,"BackgroundThe adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to pooled library gene knockout screens in mammalian cells represents a major technological leap over RNA interference, the prior state of the art. New methods for analyzing the data and evaluating results are needed.\n\nResultsWe offer BAGEL (Bayesian Analysis of Gene EssentiaLity), a supervised learning method for analyzing gene knockout screens. Coupled with gold-standard reference sets of essential and nonessential genes, BAGEL offers significantly greater sensitivity than current methods, while computational optimizations reduce runtime by an order of magnitude.\n\nConclusionsUsing BAGEL, we identify ~2,000 fitness genes in pooled library knockout screens in human cell lines at 5% FDR, a major advance over competing platforms. BAGEL shows high sensitivity and specificity even across screens with highly variable reagent quality."
10.1101/033175,"Populations continually incur new mutations with fitness effects ranging from lethal to adaptive. While the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is not directly observable, many mutations likely have either no effect on organismal fitness or are deleterious. Historically, it has been hypothesized that a population may carry many mildly deleterious variants as segregating variation, which reduces the mean absolute fitness of the population. Recent advances in sequencing technology and sequence conservation-based metrics for inferring the functional effect of a variant permit examination of the persistence of deleterious variants in populations. The issue of segregating deleterious variation is particularly important for crop improvement, because the demographic history of domestication and breeding allows deleterious variants to persist and reach moderate frequency, potentially reducing crop productivity. In this study, we use exome resequencing of fifteen barley accessions and genome resequencing of eight soybean accessions to investigate the prevalence of deleterious SNPs in the protein-coding regions of the genomes of two crops. We conclude that individual cultivars carry hundreds of deleterious SNPs on average, and that nonsense variants make up a minority of deleterious SNPs. Our approach annotates known phenotype-altering variants as deleterious more frequently than the genome-wide average, suggesting that putatively deleterious variants are likely to affect phenotypic variation. We also report the implementation of a SNP annotation tool (BAD_Mutations) that makes use of a likelihood ratio test based on alignment of all currently publicly available Angiosperm genomes."
10.1101/033191,"In the context of a master level programming practical at the computer science department of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, we developed and make available two independent and highly optimized open-source implementations for the pair-wise statistical alignment model, also known as TKF91, that was developed by Thorne, Kishino, and Felsenstein in 1991. This paper has two parts. In the educational part, we cover teaching issues regarding the setup of the course and the practical and summarize student and teacher experiences. In the scientific part, the two student teams (Team I: Nikolai, Sebastian, Daniel; Team II: Sarah, Pierre) present their solutions for implementing efficient and numerically stable implementations of the TKF91 algorithm. The two teams worked independently on implementing the same algorithm. Hence, since the implementations yield identical results --with slight numerical deviations-- we are confident that the implementations are correct. We describe the optimizations applied and make them available as open-source codes in the hope that our findings and software will be useful to the community as well as for similar programming practicals at other universities."
10.1101/033043,"The rate at which genomes adapt to environmental changes and the prevalence of adaptive processes in molecular evolution are two controversial issues in current evolutionary genetics. Previous attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major metazoan phyla - with the notable exception of humans and primates. The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be positively correlated to species effective population size. This relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution due to more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors influencing the rate of adaptive evolution and positive selection detection in humans vs. other organisms are discussed.\n\nAuthor summaryThe rate at which species adapt to environmental changes is a controversial topic. The theory predicts that adaptation is easier in large than in small populations, and the genomic studies of model organisms have revealed a much higher adaptive rate in large population-sized flies than in small population-sized humans and apes. Here we build and analyse a large data set of protein-coding sequences made of thousands of genes in 44 pairs of species from various groups of animals including insects, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Extending and improving existing data analysis methods, we show that adaptation is a major process in protein evolution across all phyla of animals: the proportion of amino-acid substitutions that occurred adaptively is above 50% in a majority of species, and reaches up to 90%. Our analysis does not confirm that population size, here approached through species genetic diversity and ecological traits, does influence the rate of adaptive molecular evolution, but points to human and apes as a special case, compared to other animals, in terms of adaptive genomic processes."
10.1101/033225,"Advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS) platforms and DNA library preparation have led to the development of methods for high throughput sequencing of bacterial genomes at a relatively low cost (Loman et al. 2012; Medini et al. 2008). WGS offers unprecedented resolution for determining degrees of relatedness between strains of bacterial pathogens and has proven a powerful tool for microbial population studies and epidemiological investigations (Harris et al. 2010; Lienau et al. 2011; Holt et al. 2009; Ashton, Peters, et al. 2015). The potential utility of WGS to public health microbiology has been highlighted previously (Koser et al. 2012; Kwong et al. 2013; Reuter et al. 2013; Joensen et al. 2014; Nair et al. 2014; Bakker et al. 2014; DAuria et al. 2014). Here we report, for the first time, the routine use of WGS as the primary test for identification, surveillance and outbreak investigation by a national reference laboratory. We present data on how this has revolutionised public health microbiology for one of the most common bacterial pathogens in the United Kingdom, the Salmonellae.\n\nDATA SUMMARY1. PHE Salmonella sequencing data is deposited in the Sequence Read Archive in BioProject PRJNA248792.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe first human genome cost around $3 billion, and took around 10 years to complete. Advances in DNA sequencing technology (also referred to as whole genome sequencing (WGS)) allow the same feat to be accomplished today for less than $10000 and less than 2 weeks. This remarkable improvement in technology has also led to a step change in microbiology, increasing our understanding of the evolution of major human pathogens such as Yersinia pestis, Salmonella Typhi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While these kinds of academic studies provide unparalleled context for public health action, until now, this approach has not been routinely employed at the frontline. At Public Health England, WGS has been implemented for routine public health identification, characterisation and typing of an important human pathogen, Salmonella, replacing methods that have changed little over the last 100 years. Analysis of WGS data has identified outbreaks that were previously undetectable and been used to infer rare antimicrobial resistance patterns. This paper will serve as a notification to the community of the methods PHE are using, and will be of great use to other public health labs considering switching to WGS."
10.1101/032292,"We made use of two recent, large-scale Drosophila GAL4 libraries and associated confocal imaging datasets to automatically segment large brain regions into smaller putative functional units such as neuropils and fiber tracts. The method we developed is based on the hypothesis that molecular identity can be used to assign individual voxels to biologically meaningful regions. Our results (available at https://strawlab.org/braincode) are consistent with this hypothesis because regions with well-known anatomy, namely the antennal lobes and central complex, were automatically segmented into familiar compartments. We then applied the algorithm to the central brain regions receiving input from the optic lobes. Based on the automated segmentation and manual validation, we can identify and provide promising driver lines for 10 previously identified and 14 novel types of visual projection neurons and their associated optic glomeruli. The same strategy can be used in other brain regions and likely other species, including vertebrates."
10.1101/033241,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system is widely used for various biological applications, including genome editing. We developed engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) using CRISPR to isolate target genomic regions from cells for their biochemical characterization. In this study, we developed \""in vitro enChIP\"" using recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to isolate target genomic regions. in vitro enChIP has the great advantage over conventional enChIP of not requiring expression of CRISPR complexes in cells. We first demonstrate that in vitro enChIP using recombinant CRISPR RNPs can be used to isolate target DNA from mixtures of purified DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we show that this technology can be employed to efficiently isolate target genomic regions, while retaining their intracellular molecular interactions, with negligible contamination from irrelevant genomic regions. Thus, in vitro enChIP technology is of potential use for sequence-specific isolation of DNA, as well as for identification of molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest in vivo in combination with downstream analysis."
10.1101/033118,"A central challenge in the analysis of genetic variation is to provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples. Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies consume a great deal of space, are slow to parse and do not take advantage of shared structure in correlated trees. We solve these problems by introducing sparse trees and coalescence records as the key units of genealogical analysis. Using these tools, exact simulation of the coalescent with recombination for chromosome-sized regions over hundreds of thousands of samples is possible, and substantially faster than present-day approximate methods. We can also analyse the results orders of magnitude more quickly than with existing methods."
10.1101/033290,"Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.), an evergreen tree of the Meliaceae family, is known for its medicinal, cosmetic, pesticidal and insecticidal properties. We had previously sequenced and published the draft genome of the plant, using mainly short read sequencing data. In this report, we present an improved genome assembly generated using additional short reads from Illumina and long reads from Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencer. We assembled short reads and error-corrected long reads using Platanus, an assembler designed to perform well for heterozygous genomes. The updated genome assembly (v2.0) yielded 3- and 3.5-fold increase in N50 and N75, respectively; 2.6-fold decrease in the total number of scaffolds; 1.25-fold increase in the number of valid transcriptome alignments; 13.4-fold less mis-assembly and 1.85-fold increase in the percentage repeat, over the earlier assembly (v1.0). The current assembly also maps better to the genes known to be involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Together, the data represents an improved assembly of the A. indica genome.\n\nThe raw data described in this manuscript are submitted to the NCBI Short Read Archive under the accession numbers SRX1074131, SRX1074132, SRX1074133, and SRX1074134 (SRP013453)."
10.1101/033274,"Although the importance of density-dependent dispersal has been recognized in theory, few empirical studies have examined how immigration changes over a wide range of densities. In a replicated experiment using a novel approach allowing within-site comparison, we examined changes in immigration rate following the gradual removal of territorial damselfish from a limited area within a much larger patch of continuous habitat. In all sites, immigration occurred at intermediate densities but did not occur before the start of removals and only rarely as density approached zero. In the combined data and in 5 of 7 sites, the number of immigrants was a hump-shaped function of density. This is the first experimental evidence for hump-shaped, density-dependent immigration. This pattern may be more widespread than previously recognized because studies over more limited density ranges have identified positive density dependence at low densities and negative density dependence at high densities. Positive density dependence at low density can arise from limits to the number of potential immigrants and from behavioral preferences for settling near conspecifics. Negative density dependence at high density can arise from competition for resources, especially high quality territories. The potential for non-linear effects of local density on immigration needs to be recognized for robust predictions of conservation reserve function, harvest impacts, pest control, and the dynamics of fragmented populations."
10.1101/033282,"River impoundments are commonly cited as key disturbances to freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Dams alter natural hydrological regimes, homogenize river system dynamics at a global scale, can act as barriers for migratory species and may facilitate species invasions. In this synthesis, we examined the short- and long-term effects of impoundment on fish population dynamics and community structure. At the population level, we tested the \""trophic surge hypothesis\"", which predicts a hump-shaped response of fish abundance through time after impoundment. We tested the hypothesis on 40 recruitment time series and 125 adult abundance time series from 19 species and nine reservoirs distributed in temperate and boreal regions. At the community level, we compared diversity metrics (richness, evenness, diversity) on two datasets: 1) between reservoirs and reference ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and streams) and 2) over time (before and after impoundment and over time). At the population level, the trophic surge hypothesis was supported in more than 55% of the time series but we observed significant variation across species, reservoirs and regions. Fish recruitment increased substantially during reservoir filling and shortly after impoundment, and was usually followed by an increase in adult fish. The surge was transient and vanished after 3-4 years for recruits and after 10 years for adults. However, we are lacking long time series to conclude about population patterns in the trophic equilibrium phase. At the community level, we did not find any strong directional patterns in species diversity metrics when comparing reservoirs to reference lakes but found higher diversity and evenness in reservoirs and impounded streams/rivers relative to unimpounded streams/rivers. We did not find directional patterns when looking at a change over time. Variability in the reported diversity results across studies may be related to the ability to tease apart the unique effects of impoundment and water regulation from other stressors such as propagule pressure and eutrophication, as well as the comparability of the reference system. In conclusion, fish populations benefited quickly but transiently from impoundment, and longer time series are needed to conclude about population dynamics and equilibrium in aging reservoirs in order to develop management recommendations."
10.1101/033233,"In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a primary heritable epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates many cellular processes. While the whole-genome methylation pattern has been generally conserved in different eukaryotic groups, invertebrates and vertebrates exhibit two distinct patterns. Whereas almost all CpG sites are methylated in most vertebrates, with the exception of short unmethylated regions call CpG islands, the most frequent pattern in invertebrate animals is  mosaic methylation, comprising domains of heavily methylated DNA interspersed with domains that are methylation free. The mechanism by which the genome methylation pattern transited from a mosaic to a global pattern and the role of the one or two-round whole-genome duplication in this transition remain largely elusive, partly owing to the lack of methylome data from early vertebrates. In this study, we used the whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing technology to investigate the genome-wide methylation in three tissues (heart, muscle, and sperm) from the sea lamprey, an extant Agarthan vertebrate. Analyses of methylation level and the extent of CpG dinucleotide depletion of geneencoding, intergenic and promoter regions revealed a gradual increase in the methylation level from invertebrates to vertebrates, with the sea lamprey exhibiting an intermediate position. In addition, the methylation level of the majority of CpGs was intermediate in each sea lamprey tissue, indicating a high level of heterogeneity of methylation status between individual cells. In this regard, we defined the genomic methylation pattern of sea lamprey as \""global genomic DNA intermediate methylation\"". The methylation features in different genomic regions, such as the transcription start site (TSS) region of the gene body, exon-intron boundaries, transposons, as well as genes grouping with different expression levels, supported the gradual methylation transition hypothesis. We further discussed that the copy number difference in DNA methylation transferases and the loss of the PWWP domain and/or DNTase domain in DNMT3 sub-family enzymes may have contributed to the methylation pattern transition in early vertebrates. These findings demonstrate an intermediate genomic methylation pattern between invertebrates and jawed vertebrates, providing evidence that supports the hypothesis that methylation patterns underwent a gradual transition from invertebrates (mosaic) to vertebrates (global)."
10.1101/033084,"Most disease associated genetic risk factors are non-coding, making it challenging to design experiments to understand their functional consequences1,2. Identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been a powerful approach to infer downstream effects of disease variants but the large majority remains unexplained.3,4. The analysis of DNA methylation, a key component of the epigenome5, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions6,7. However, a large-scale, combined analysis of methylome and transcriptome data to infer downstream effects of disease variants is lacking. Here, we show that disease variants have wide-spread effects on DNA methylation in trans that likely reflect the downstream effects on binding sites of cis-regulated transcription factors. Using data on 3,841 Dutch samples, we detected 272,037 independent cis-meQTLs (FDR < 0.05) and identified 1,907 trait-associated SNPs that affect methylation levels of 10,141 different CpG sites in trans (FDR < 0.05), an eight-fold increase in the number of downstream effects that was known from trans-eQTL studies3,8,9. Trans-meQTL CpG sites are enriched for active regulatory regions, being correlated with gene expression and overlap with Hi-C determined interchromosomal contacts10,11. We detected many trans-meQTL SNPs that affect expression levels of nearby transcription factors (including NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3), while the corresponding trans-meQTL CpG sites frequently coincide with its respective binding site. Trans-meQTL mapping therefore provides a strategy for identifying and better understanding downstream functional effects of many disease-associated variants."
10.1101/033266,"Addressing how neural circuits underlie behavior is routinely done by measuring electrical activity from single neurons during experimental sessions. While such recordings yield snapshots of neural dynamics during specified tasks, they are ill-suited for tracking single-unit activity over longer timescales relevant for most developmental and learning processes, or for capturing neural dynamics across different behavioral states. Here we describe an automated platform for continuous long-term recordings of neural activity and behavior in freely moving animals. An unsupervised algorithm identifies and tracks the activity of single units over weeks of recording, dramatically simplifying the analysis of large datasets. Months-long recordings from motor cortex and striatum made and analyzed with our system revealed remarkable stability in basic neuronal properties, such as firing rates and inter-spike interval distributions. Interneuronal correlations and the representation of different movements and behaviors were similarly stable.

10.1101/033308,"Water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of biomass (B) produced per unit of water transpired (E) by plants, is an important determinant of plant productivity. A mathematical approach was developed with the purpose explaining the WUE of two forage legumes (clover and birdsfoot trefoil). The approach applied involved an interpolation method by cubic spline which results in the smoothest curve that fits the set of data points obtained experimentally. The results obtained show the importance of recognizing the WUE as a function of two variables, one represents the supply ({theta}) and the other represents the demand (D). It is important to note that these surfaces generated by the model allowed the estimation of the WUE value for any value of {theta} and any value of D, showing it is able to dissect the effect of both environmental variables on WUE. From the surface generated by the model, a scalar field plot (SFP) was created. Analysis of these SFPs allowed decomposing the environmental effect on B and E parameters defining WUE. The SFPs allow identify, in one picture, what are the environmental conditions and what variable are explaining a high WUE in both species. Spline application for generating SFP could have a significant impact on the quantitative understanding of the WUE and our study represents a first step towards an analytical and integrated view of this parameters.\n\nMathematics Subject Classification 92B05 65D05 65D07 65D10"

The constructed Bayesian network has identified four gene clusters of distinct cellular functions, 13 driver genes, as well as some new biological pathways which may shed new light into the molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer."
10.1101/033217,"Genetic risk factors often localize in non-coding regions of the genome with unknown effects on disease etiology. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying the association of genetic risk factors with disease. More mechanistic insights can be derived from knowledge of the context, such as cell type or the activity of signaling pathways, influencing the nature and strength of eQTLs. Here, we generated peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 2,116 unrelated Dutch individuals and systematically identified these context-dependent eQTLs using a hypothesis-free strategy that does not require prior knowledge on the identity of the modifiers. Out of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05), 2,743 genes (12%) show context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of those were influenced by cell type composition, revealing eQTLs that are particularly strong in cell types such as CD4+ T-cells, erythrocytes, and even lowly abundant eosinophils. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs were influenced by the activity of the type I interferon signaling pathway and we identified several cis-eQTLs that are modulated by specific transcription factors that bind to the eQTL SNPs. This demonstrates that large-scale eQTL studies in unchallenged individuals can complement perturbation experiments to gain better insight in regulatory networks and their stimuli."
10.1101/033373,"Inferring and understanding changes in effective population size over time is a major challenge for population genetics. Here we investigate some theoretical properties of random mating populations with varying size over time. In particular, we present an exact method to compute the population size as a function of time using the distributions of coalescent-times of samples of any size. This result reduces the problem of population size inference to a problem of estimating coalescent-time distributions. Using tree inference algorithms and genetic data, we can investigate the effects of a range of conditions associated with real data, for instance finite number of loci, sample size, mutation rate and presence of cryptic recombination. We show that our method requires at least a modest number of loci (10,000 or more) and that increasing the sample size from 2 to 10 greatly improves the inference whereas further increase in sample size only results in a modest improvement, even under as scenario of exponential growth. We also show that small amounts of recombination can lead to biased population size reconstruction when unaccounted for. The approach can handle large sample sizes and the computations are fast. We apply our method on human genomes from 4 populations and reconstruct population size profiles that are coherent with previous knowledge, including the Out-of-Africa bottleneck. Additionally, a potential difference in population size between African and non-African populations as early as 400 thousand years ago is uncovered."
10.1101/033365,"Understanding the driving forces and molecular processes underlying dioecy and sex chromosome evolution, leading from hermaphroditism to the occurrence of male and female individuals, is of considerable interest in fundamental and applied research. The genus Phoenix, belonging to the family Arecaceae, consists of only dioecious species. Phylogenetic data suggests that the genus Phoenix diverged from a hermaphroditic ancestor shared with its closest relatives. Here we investigated the evolution of suppressed recombination within the genus Phoenix as a whole by extending the analysis of P. dactylifera sex-related loci to eight other species within the genus. We also performed a phylogenetic analysis of a date palm sex-linked PdMYB1 gene in these species. We found that X and Y sex-linked alleles clustered in a species-independent fashion. Our data show that sex chromosomes evolved before the diversification of the extant dioecious species. Furthermore, the distribution of Y haplotypes revealed two male ancestral paternal lineages which may have emerged prior to speciation."
10.1101/033464,"Tardigrades are meiofaunal ecdysozoans that are key to understanding the origins of Arthropoda. Many species of Tardigrada can survive extreme conditions through cryptobiosis. In a recent paper (Boothby TC et al (2015) Evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112:15976-15981) the authors concluded that the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini had an unprecedented proportion (17%) of genes originating through functional horizontal gene transfer (fHGT), and speculated that fHGT was likely formative in the evolution of cryptobiosis. We independently sequenced the genome of H. dujardini. As expected from whole-organism DNA sampling, our raw data contained reads from non-target genomes. Filtering using metagenomics approaches generated a draft H. dujardini genome assembly of 135 Mb with superior assembly metrics to the previously published assembly. Additional microbial contamination likely remains. We found no support for extensive fHGT. Among 23,021 gene predictions we identified 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from bacteria, and 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of assemblies showed that the overwhelming majority of HGT candidates in the Boothby et al. genome derived from contaminants. We conclude that fHGT into H. dujardini accounts for at most 1-2% of genes and that the proposal that one sixth of tardigrade genes originate from functional HGT events is an artefact of undetected contamination."
10.1101/033134,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) promised to translate their findings into clinically beneficial improvements of patient management by tailoring disease management to the individual through the prediction of disease risk1,2. However, the ability to translate genetic findings from GWAS into predictive tools that are of clinical utility and which may inform clinical practice has, so far, been encouraging but limited1,2. Here we propose to use a more powerful statistical approach that enables the prediction of multiple medically relevant phenotypes without the costs associated with developing a genetic test for each of them. As a proof of principle, we used a common panel of 319,038 SNPs to train the prediction models in 114,264 unrelated White-British for height and four obesity related traits (body mass index, basal metabolic rate, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio). We obtained prediction accuracies that ranged between 46% and 75% of the maximum achievable given their explained heritable component. This represents an improvement of up to 75% over the phenotypic variance explained by the predictors developed through large collaborations3, which used more than twice as many training samples. Across-population predictions in White nonBritish individuals were similar to those of White-British whilst those in Asian and Black individuals were informative but less accurate. The genotyping of circa 500,000 UK Biobank4 participants will yield predictions ranging between 66% and 83% of the maximum. We anticipate that our models and a common panel of genetic markers, which can be used across multiple traits and diseases, will be the starting point to tailor disease management to the individual. Ultimately, we will be able to capitalise on whole-genome sequence and environmental risk factors to realise the full potential of genomic medicine."
10.1101/033340,"Under extreme water deficit, endolithic (inside rock) microbial ecosystems are considered environmental refuges for life in cold and hot deserts, yet their diversity and functional adaptations remain vastly unexplored. The metagenomic analyses of the communities from two rock substrates, calcite and ignimbrite, revealed that they were dominated by Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. The relative distribution of major phyla was significantly different between the two substrates and biodiversity estimates, from 16S rRNA gene sequences and from the metagenome data, all pointed to a higher taxonomic diversity in the calcite community. While both endolithic communities showed adaptations to extreme aridity and to the rock habitat, their functional capabilities revealed significant differences. ABC transporters and pathways for osmoregulation were more diverse in the calcite chasmoendolithic community. In contrast, the ignimbrite cryptoendolithic community was enriched in pathways for secondary metabolites, such as non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) and polyketides (PKS). Assemblies of the metagenome data produced population genomes for the major phyla found in both communities and revealed a greater diversity of Cyanobacteria population genomes for the calcite substrate. Draft genomes of the dominant Cyanobacteria in each community were constructed with more than 93% estimated completeness. The two annotated proteomes shared 64% amino acid identity and a significantly higher number of genes involved in iron update, and NRPS gene clusters, were found in the draft genomes from the ignimbrite. Both the community-wide and genome-specific differences may be related to higher water availability and the colonization of large fissures and cracks in the calcite in contrast to a harsh competition for colonization space and nutrient resources in the narrow pores of the ignimbrite. Together, these results indicated that the habitable architecture of both lithic substrates-chasmoendolithic versus cryptoendolithic - might be an essential element in determining the colonization and the diversity of the microbial communities in endolithic substrates at the dry limit for life."
10.1101/033407,"In the dawning era of large-scale biomedical data, multidimensional phenotype vectors will play an increasing role in examining the genetic underpinnings of brain features, behavior and disease. For example, shape measurements derived from brain MRI scans are multidimensional geometric descriptions of brain structure and provide an alternate class of phenotypes that remains largely unexplored in genetic studies. Here we extend the concept of heritability to multidimensional traits, and present the first comprehensive analysis of the heritability of neuroanatomical shape measurements across an ensemble of brain structures based on genome-wide SNP and MRI data from 1,320 unrelated, young and healthy individuals. We replicate our findings in an extended twin sample from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results demonstrate that neuroanatomical shape can be significantly heritable, above and beyond volume, and can serve as a complementary phenotype to study the genetic determinants and clinical relevance of brain structure."
10.1101/032029,"It is well known that single-gene circuits with negative feedback loop can lead to oscillatory gene expression when they operate with time delay. In order to generate these oscillations many processes can contribute to properly timing such delay. Here we show that the time delay coming from the transitions between internal states of the cis-regulatory system (CRS) can drive sustained oscillations in an auto-repressive single-gene circuit operating in a small volume like a cell. We found that the cooperative binding of repressor molecules is not mandatory for a oscillatory behavior if there are enough binding sites in the CRS. These oscillations depend on an adequate balance between the CRS kinetic, and the synthesis/degradation rates of repressor molecules. This finding suggest that the multi-site CRS architecture plays a key role for oscillatory behavior of gene expression.\n\nPACS numbers: 82.40.Bj,87.10.Mn,87.16.-b,87.16.Yc,87.18.Tt,87.18.Vf"

10.1101/032516,"The catalytic site of most enzymes can essentially deal with only one substrate. In contrast, the ribosome is capable of polymerizing at a similar rate at least 20 different kinds of amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNA carriers while using just one catalytic site, the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). An induced-fit mechanism has been uncovered in the PTC, but a possible connection between this mechanism and the uniform handling of the substrates has not been investigated. We present an analysis of published ribosome structures supporting the hypothesis that the inducedfit eliminates unreactive rotamers predominantly populated for some A-site aminoacyl esters before induction. We show that this hypothesis is fully consistent with the wealth of kinetic data obtained with these substrates. Our analysis reveals that induction constrains the amino acids into a reactive conformation in a side-chain independent manner. It allows us to highlight the rationale of the PTC structural organization, which confers to the ribosome the very unusual ability to handle large as well as small substrates."
10.1101/033423,"Thousands of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes are encoded in the human genome, and hundreds of them are evolutionary conserved, but their functions and modes of action remain largely obscure. Particularly enigmatic lncRNAs are those that are exported to the cytoplasm, including NORAD - an abundant and highly conserved cytoplasmic lncRNA. Most of the sequence of NORAD is comprised of repetitive units that together contain at least 17 functional binding sites for the two Pumilio homologs in mammals. Through binding to PUM1 and PUM2, NORAD modulates the mRNA levels of their targets, which are enriched for genes involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. Our results suggest that some cytoplasmic lncRNAs function by modulating the activities of RNA binding proteins, an activity which positions them at key junctions of cellular signaling pathways."

10.1101/033498,"Ecosystem service research has gained attraction, and the topic is also high on the policy agenda. Projects such as TEEB have generalized results of individual case studies to provide guidelines for policy makers and stakeholders. Seppelt et al. (2011) raised critical questions about four facets that characterize the holistic ideal of ecosystem services research: (i) biophysical realism of ecosystem data and models; (ii) consideration of trade-offs between ecosystem services; (iii) recognition of off-site effects; and (iv) comprehensive but shrewd involvement of stakeholders within assessment studies. An extended and updated analysis of ecosystem service case studies showed that the majority of these facets were still not addressed by the majority of case studies. Whilst most indicators did not improve within the span analyzed (1996-2013), we found a tendency for an increasing geographical spread of the case studies. Moreover, we incorporated an additional facet, namely the relevance and usability of case study results for the operationalization of the ecosystem service concept. Only a minority of studies addressed this facet sufficiently with no significant trend for improvement over time."
10.1101/033514,"Reticulate evolution is thought to accelerate the process of evolution beyond simple genetic drift and selection, helping to rapidly generate novel hybrids with combinations of adaptive traits. However, the long-standing dogma that reticulate evolutionary processes are likewise advantageous for switching ecological niches, as in microbial pathogen host switch events, has not been explicitly tested. We use data from the influenza genome sequencing project and a phylogenetic heuristic approach to show that reassortment, a reticulate evolutionary mechanism, predominates over mutational drift in transmission between different host species. Moreover, as host evolutionary distance increases, reassortment is increasingly favored. We conclude that the greater the quantitative difference between ecological niches, the greater the importance of reticulate evolutionary processes in overcoming niche barriers.\n\nSignificance StatementAre the processes that result in the exchange of genes between microbes quantitatively advantageous for those microbes when switching between ecological niches? To address this question, we consider the influenza A virus as a model microbe, with its ability to infect multiple host species (ecological niches) and undergo reassortment (exchange genes) with one another. Through our analysis of sequence data from the Influenza Research Database and the Barcode of Life Database, we find that the greater the quantitative difference between influenza hosts, the greater the proportion of reassortment events were found. More broadly, for microbes, we infer that reticulate evolutionary processes should be quantitatively favoured when switching between ecological niches."
10.1101/033506,"Sex specific pheromones are known to play an important role in butterfly courtship, and may influence both individual reproductive success and reproductive isolation between species. Extensive ecological, behavioural and genetic studies of Heliconius butterflies have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of speciation. Male pheromones, although long suspected to play an important role, have received relatively little attention in this genus. Here, we combine morphological, chemical, and behavioural analyses of male pheromones in the Neotropical butterfly Heliconius melpomene. First, we identify putative androconia that are specialized brush-like scales that lie within the shiny grey region of the male hindwing. We then describe putative male sex pheromone compounds, which are largely confined to the androconial region of the hindwing of mature males, but are absent in immature males and females. Finally, behavioural choice experiments reveal that females of H. melpomene, H. erato and H. timareta strongly discriminate against conspecific males which have their androconial region experimentally blocked. As well as demonstrating the importance of chemical signalling for female mate choice in Heliconius butterflies, the results describe structures involved in release of the pheromone and a list of potential male sex pheromone compounds."
10.1101/033480,"Cellular senescence has been viewed as an irreversible cell cycle arrest that acts to prevent cancer. Recent studies discovered widespread shortening of 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in cancer cells. However, the role of APA in the process of cellular senescence remains elusive. We thus applied our published PA-seq method to investigate APA regulation in different passages of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from rats of different ages. We found that genes in senescent cells tended to use distal poly(A) sites (pAs). An independent RNA-seq analysis gave rise to the same conclusion. Interestingly, the level of expression of genes preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs tended to decrease. More importantly, genes that preferred to use distal pAs in senescent MFEs and VSMCs were enriched in common senescence-related pathways such as ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and cell cycle. Further, the longer 3' UTRs of the genes that tended to use distal pAs introduced more conserved binding sites of senescence-related microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Noteworthy, the expression level of core factors involved in cleavage and the polyadenylation tended to decrease, while those factors showed opposite trend in cancer cells. In summary, we showed, for the first time, that APA is a hidden layer of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation involved in cellular senescence."
10.1101/033522,"The recent widespread emergence of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is a major public health concern, as carbapenems are a therapy of last resort in this family of common bacterial pathogens. Resistance genes can mobilize via various mechanisms including conjugation and transposition, however the importance of this mobility in short-term evolution, such as within nosocomial outbreaks, is currently unknown. Using a combination of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing of 281 blaKPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolated from a single hospital over five years, we demonstrate rapid dissemination of this carbapenem resistance gene to multiple species, strains, and plasmids. Mobility of blaKPC occurs at multiple nested genetic levels, with transmission of blaKPC strains between individuals, frequent transfer of blaKPC plasmids between strains/species, and frequent transposition of the blaKPC transposon Tn4401 between plasmids. We also identify a common insertion site for Tn4401 within various Tn2-like elements, suggesting that homologous recombination between Tn2-like elements has enhanced the spread of Tn4401 between different plasmid vectors. Furthermore, while short-read sequencing has known limitations for plasmid assembly, various studies have attempted to overcome this with the use of reference-based methods. We also demonstrate that as a consequence of the genetic mobility observed herein, plasmid structures can be extremely dynamic, and therefore these reference-based methods, as well as traditional partial typing methods, can produce very misleading conclusions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that non-clonal resistance gene dissemination can be extremely rapid, presenting significant challenges for public health surveillance and achieving effective control of antibiotic resistance.\n\nImportanceIncreasing antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human health, as highlighted by the recent emergence of multi-drug resistant \""superbugs\"". Here, we tracked how one important multi-drug resistance gene spread in a single hospital over five years. This revealed high levels of resistance gene mobility to multiple bacterial species, which was facilitated by various different genetic mechanisms. The mobility occurred at multiple nested genetic levels, analogous to a Russian doll set where smaller dolls may be carried along inside larger dolls. Our results challenge traditional views that drug-resistance outbreaks are due to transmission of a single pathogenic strain. Instead, outbreaks can be \""gene-based\"", and we must therefore focus on tracking specific resistance genes and their context rather than only specific bacteria."
10.1101/033472,"Temporally precise movement patterns underlie many motor skills and innate actions, yet the flexibility with which the timing of such stereotyped behaviors can be modified is poorly understood. To probe this, we induced adaptive changes to the temporal structure of birdsong. We find that the duration of specific song segments can be modified without affecting the timing in other parts of the song. We derive formal prescriptions for how neural networks can implement such flexible motor timing. We find that randomly connected recurrent networks, a common approximation for how neocortex is wired, do not generally conform to these, though certain implementations can approximate them. We show that feedforward networks, by virtue of their one-to-one mapping between network activity and time, are better suited. Our study provides general prescriptions for pattern generator networks that implement flexible motor timing, an important aspect of many motor skills, including birdsong and human speech."
10.1101/033548,"Developing neuronal networks display spontaneous rhythmic bursts of action potentials that are necessary for circuit organization and tuning. While spontaneous activity has been shown to instruct map formation in sensory circuits, it is unknown whether it plays a role in the organization of motor networks that produce rhythmic output. Using computational modeling we investigate how recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations assemble to produce robust patterns of unidirectional and precisely-timed propagating activity during organism locomotion. One example is provided by the motor network in Drosophila larvae, which generates propagating peristaltic waves of muscle contractions during crawling. We examine two activity-dependent models which tune weak network connectivity based on spontaneous activity patterns: a Hebbian model, where coincident activity in neighboring populations strengthens connections between them; and a homeostatic model, where connections are homeostatically regulated to maintain a constant level of excitatory activity based on spontaneous input. The homeostatic model tunes network connectivity to generate robust activity patterns with the appropriate timing relationships between neighboring populations. These timing relationships can be modulated by the properties of spontaneous activity suggesting its instructive role for generating functional variability in network output. In contrast, the Hebbian model fails to produce the tight timing relationships between neighboring populations required for unidirectional activity propagation, even when additional assumptions are imposed to constrain synaptic growth. These results argue that homeostatic mechanisms are more likely than Hebbian mechanisms to tune weak connectivity based on local activity patterns in a recurrent network for rhythm generation and propagation."
10.1101/033563,"Adaptation in diploids is predicted to proceed via mutations that are at least partially dominant in fitness. Recently we argued that many adaptive mutations might also be commonly overdominant in fitness. Natural (directional) selection acting on overdominant mutations should drive them into the population but then, instead of bringing them to fixation, should maintain them as balanced polymorphisms via heterozygote advantage. If true, this would make adaptive evolution in sexual diploids differ drastically from that of haploids. Unfortunately, the validity of this prediction has not yet been tested experimentally. Here we performed 4 replicate evolutionary experiments with diploid yeast populations (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) growing in glucose-limited continuous cultures. We sequenced 24 evolved clones and identified initial adaptive mutations in all four chemostats. The first adaptive mutations in all four chemostats were three CNVs, all of which proved to be overdominant in fitness. The fact that fitness overdominant mutations were always the first step in independent adaptive walks strongly supports the prediction that heterozygote advantage can arise as a common outcome of directional selection in diploids and demonstrates that overdominance of de novo adaptive mutations in diploids is not rare."
10.1101/033571,"Lamarckian inheritance has been largely discredited until the recent discovery of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. However, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is still under debate for unable to rule out DNA sequence changes as the underlying cause for heritability. Here, through profiling of the sperm methylomes and genomes of two recently diverged rat subspecies, we analyzed the relationship between epigenetic variation and DNA variation, and their relative contribution to evolution of species. We found that only epigenetic markers located in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between subspecies, but not within subspecies, can be stably and effectively passed through generations. DMRs in response to both random and stable environmental difference show increased nucleotide diversity, and we demonstrated that it is variance of methylation level but not deamination caused by methylation driving increasing of nucleotide diversity in DMRs, indicating strong relationship between environment-associated changes of chromatin accessibility and increased nucleotide diversity. Further, we detected that accelerated fixation of DNA variants occur only in inter-subspecies DMRs in response to stable environmental difference but not intra-subspecies DMRs in response to random environmental difference or non-DMRs, indicating that this process is possibly driven by environment-associated fixation of divergent methylation status. Our results thus establish a bridge between Lamarckian inheritance and Darwinian selection."
10.1101/033555,"1.BackgroundCurrent cell-free DNA (cfDNA) assessment of fetal chromosomes does not analyze and report on all chromosomes. Hence, a significant proportion of fetal chromosomal abnormalities are not detectable by current non-invasive methods. Here we report the clinical validation of a novel NIPT designed to detect genome-wide gains and losses of chromosomal material [&ge;]7 Mb and losses associated with specific deletions <7 Mb.\n\nObjectiveThe objective of this study is to provide a clinical validation of the sensitivity and specificity of a novel NIPT for detection of genome-wide abnormalities.\n\nStudy DesignThis retrospective, blinded study included maternal plasma collected from 1222 study subjects with pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities that were assessed for trisomy 21 (T21), trisomy 18 (T18), trisomy 13 (T13), sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), fetal sex, genome-wide copy number variants (CNVs) 7 Mb and larger, and select deletions smaller than 7 Mb. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G-band karyotyping, microarray data, or high coverage sequencing.\n\nResultsClinical sensitivity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, T13, and SCAs, and 97.7% for genome-wide CNVs. Clinical specificity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, and T13, and 99.9% for SCAs and CNVs. Fetal sex classification had an accuracy of 99.6%.\n\nConclusionThis study has demonstrated that genome-wide non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal chromosomal abnormalities can provide high resolution, sensitive, and specific detection of a wide range of sub-chromosomal and whole chromosomal abnormalities that were previously only detectable by invasive karyotype analysis. In some instances, this NIPT also provided additional clarification about the origin of genetic material that had not been identified by invasive karyotype analysis."
10.1101/033597,"In finite populations, mutation limitation and genetic drift can hinder evolutionary diversification. We consider the evolution of a quantitative trait in an asexual population whose size can vary and depends explicitly on the trait. Previous work showed that evolutionary branching is certain (\""deterministic branching\"") above a threshold population size, but uncertain (\""stochastic branching\"") below it. Using the stationary distribution of the populations trait variance, we identify three qualitatively different sub-domains of \""stochastic branching\"" and illustrate our results using a model of social evolution. We find that in very small populations, branching will almost never be observed; in intermediate populations, branching is intermittent, arising and disappearing over time; in larger populations, finally, branching is expected to occur and persist for substantial periods of time. Our study provides a clearer picture of the ecological conditions that facilitate the appearance and persistence of novel evolutionary lineages in the face of genetic drift."
10.1101/033605,"The sulfurea (sulf) allele is a silent epigenetic variant of a tomato gene (Solanum lycopersicum) affecting pigment production. It is homozygous lethal but, in a heterozygote sulf/+, the wild type allele undergoes silencing so that the plants exhibit chlorotic sectors. This transfer of the silenced state between alleles resembles the process of paramutation that is best characterised in maize. To understand the mechanism of paramutation we mapped SULF to the ortholog SLTAB2 of an Arabidopsis gene that, consistent with the pigment deficiency, is involved in the translation of photosystem I. Paramutation of SLTAB2 is linked to an increase in DNA methylation and production of small interfering RNAs at its promoter. Virus-induced gene silencing of SLTAB2 phenocopies sulf consistent with the possibility that siRNAs mediate the paramutation of SULFUREA. Unlike the maize systems the paramutagenicity of sulf is not, however, associated with repeated sequences at the region of siRNA production or DNA methylation."

10.1101/033613,"A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance."
10.1101/033621,"Cryptic genetic variation (CGV), hidden under most conditions, is the repressed genetic potential that can facilitate adaptation and evolution. The conditional manifestation of CGV has been claimed to explain the background dependence of causal loci as well as missing heritability. However, despite being proposed over 60 years ago, the genetic architecture and regulation of CGV and its contribution towards regulation of complex traits remains unclear. Using linkage mapping of mean and variance effects, we have identified loci that regulate phenotypic manifestation of standing genetic variation in a previously published dataset of biparental Saccharomyces cerevisiae population grown in 34 diverse environments. Based on our results we propose the existence of a gradient of buffering states for a population determined by the environment. Most environments show a tight buffering with additive, independent causal loci with little epistasis. However, as this buffering is disrupted, the underlying highly interconnected environment-specific genetic interactome is revealed such that each causal locus is a part of this network. Interspersed within these networks are generalist capacitors that regulate CGV across multiple environments, with one allele behaving as a capacitor and the other as a potentiator. Our study demonstrates the connecting link between architecture of hidden and visible genetic variation and uncovers the genetic networks which potentially underlie all complex traits. Our study establishes CGV as a significant contributor to phenotypic variation, and provides evidence for a predictable pattern underlying gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that can explain background dependence and missing heritability in complex traits and diseases.\n\nSUMMARYThe phenotypic effects of cryptic genetic variation (CGV) are mostly hidden and manifested only under certain rare conditions and have the potential to facilitate adaptation. However, little is understood about its genetic regulation. We performed variance QTL mapping to understand the regulation of phenotypic manifestation of standing genetic variation in a biparental yeast population. We propose a model describing the connecting link between visible variation and CGV. We identify generalist capacitors and environment-specific networks that potentially underlie all phenotypes. This fresh approach of mapping causal loci can solve the long-standing mystery of missing heritability in complex traits and diseases."
10.1101/033647,"The incorporation of ecological processes into models of trait evolution is important for understanding past drivers of evolutionary change. Species interactions have long been thought to be key drivers of trait evolution. However, models for comparative data that account for interactions between species are lacking. One of the challenges is that such models are intractable and difficult to express analytically. Here we present phylogenetic models of trait evolution that includes interspecific competition amongst species. Competition is modelled as a tendency of sympatric species to evolve towards distinct niches, producing trait overdispersion and high phylogenetic signal. The model predicts elevated trait variance across species and a slowdown in evolutionary rate both across the clade and within each branch. The model also predicts a reduction in correlation between otherwise correlated traits. We used an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach to estimate model parameters. We tested the power of the model to detect deviations from Brownian trait evolution using simulations, finding reasonable power to detect competition in sufficiently large (20+ species) trees. We applied the model to examine the evolution of bill morphology of Darwins finches, and found evidence that competition affects the evolution of bill length."
10.1101/033670,"SummaryHigh-throughput sequencing technologies such as ChIP-seq have deepened our understanding in many biological processes. De novo motif search is one of the key downstream computational analysis following the ChIP-seq experiments and several algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, most web-based systems do not perform independent filtering or enrichment analyses to ensure the quality of the discovered motifs. Here, we developed a web server Factorbook Motif Pipeline based on an algorithm used in analyzing ENCODE consortium ChIP-seq datasets. It performs comprehensive analysis on the set of peaks detected from a ChIP-seq experiments: (i) de novo motif discovery; (ii) independent composition and bias analyses and (iii) matching to the annotated motifs. The statistical tests employed in our pipeline provide a reliable measure of confidence as to how significant are the motifs reported in the discovery step.\n\nAvailabilityFactorbook Motif Pipeline source code is accessible through the following URL. https://github.com/joshuabhk/factorbook-motif-pipeline"
10.1101/033639,"Eco-evolutionary dynamics are now recognized to be highly relevant for population and community dynamics. However, the impact of evolutionary dynamics on spatial patterns, such as the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics, is less well appreciated. Here, we analyse the evolutionary consequences of spatial network connectivity and topology for dispersal strategies and quantify the eco-evolutionary feedback in terms of altered classical metapopulation dynamics. We find that network properties, such as topology and connectivity, lead to predictable spatio-temporal correlations in fitness expectations. These spatio-temporally stable fitness patterns heavily impact evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies and lead to eco-evolutionary feedbacks on landscape level metrics, such as the number of occupied patches, the number of extinctions and recolonizations as well as metapopulation extinction risk and genetic structure. Our model predicts that classical metapopulation dynamics are more likely to occur in dendritic networks, and especially in riverine systems, compared to other types of landscape configurations. As it remains debated whether classical metapopulation dynamics are likely to occur in nature at all, our work provides an important conceptual advance for understanding the occurrence of classical metapopulation dynamics which has implications for conservation and management of spatially structured populations."
10.1101/033662,"How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions."
10.1101/033696,"Summary: Bisulfite sequencing is the gold standard method for analyzing methylomes. However, the effect of quality control in bisulfite sequencing has not been studied extensively. We developed a package ME-Plot to detect the errors in bisulfite sequencing mapping data and produce higher quality methylation calls by trimming low quality portions of the reads. Our simulation results on both randomly generated reads where methylation status is known and real world data indicate that ME-plot can detect errors in methylation mapping procedures and suggest post-processing steps to reduce the errors. ME-Plot requires SAM/BAM files for its analysis. Availability: The python package is available at the following URL. https://github.com/joshuabhk/methylsuite"
10.1101/033720,"We develop an overarching framework that combines long-term tag-recapture data and powerful statistical and modeling techniques to investigate how population, environmental, and climate factors determine variation in vital rates and population dynamics in an animal species, using as a model system the population of brown trout living in Upper Volaja (Western Slovenia). This population has been monitored since 2004; Upper Volaja is also a sink, receiving individuals from a source population living above a waterfall. We estimate the numerical contribution of the source population on the sink population and test the effects of temperature, population density, and extreme events on variation in vital rates among more than 2,500 individually tagged brown trout. We found that fish dispersing downstream from the source population help maintain high population densities in the sink population despite poor recruitment. The best model of survival for individuals older than juveniles includes additive effects of year-of-birth and time. Fast growth of older cohorts and higher population densities in 2004-2005 suggest very low population densities in late1990s, which we hypothesize were caused by a flash flood that strongly reduced population size and created the habitat conditions for faster growth and transient higher population densities after the extreme event."
10.1101/033712,"Different types of phenotypic traits consistently exhibit different levels of genetic variation in natural populations. There are two potential explanations: either mutation produces genetic variation at different rates, or natural selection removes or promotes genetic variation at different rates. Whether mutation or selection is of greater general importance is a longstanding unresolved question in evolutionary genetics. Where the input of genetic variation by mutation differs between traits, it is usually uncertain whether the difference is the result of different mutational effects (\""mutational robustness\"") or different numbers of underlying loci (\""mutational target\""), although conventional wisdom favors the latter. We report mutational variances (VM) for 19 traits related to the first mitotic cell division in C. elegans, and compare them to the standing genetic variances (VG) for the same suite of traits in a worldwide collection C. elegans. Two robust conclusions emerge. First, the mutational process is highly repeatable: the correlation between VM in two independent sets of mutation accumulation lines is ~0.9. Second, VM for a trait is a very good predictor of VG for that trait: the correlation between VM and VG is ~0.9. This result is predicted for a population at mutation-selection balance; it is not predicted if balancing selection plays a primary role in maintaining genetic variation. Goodness- of-fit of the data to two simple models of mutation suggest that differences in mutational effects may be a more important cause of differences in VM between traits than differences in the size of the mutational target."
10.1101/033746,"X-ray diffraction has the potential to provide rich information about the structural dynamics of macromolecules. To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations must be measured. Until now measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce, due to the extra effort of collecting diffuse data. Here, we present three-dimensional measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin. The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection. To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS), Liquid-Like Motions (LLM), and coarse-grained Normal Modes (NM) models of protein motions. The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and were refined against the diffuse data, while the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data. Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data. In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data. These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that NM-based refinement can generate dynamics-inspired structural models that simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.\n\nSignificanceThe structural details of protein motions are critical to understanding many biological processes, but they are often hidden to conventional biophysical techniques. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reveal details of the correlated movements between atoms; however, the data collection historically has required extra effort and dedicated experimental protocols. We have measured three-dimensional diffuse intensities in X-ray diffraction from CypA and trypsin crystals using standard crystallographic data collection techniques. Analysis of the resulting data is consistent with the protein motions resembling diffusion in a liquid or vibrations of a soft solid. Our results show that using diffuse scattering to model protein motions can become a component of routine crystallographic analysis through the extension of commonplace methods."
10.1101/033787,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful in discovering replicable SNP-trait associations for many quantitative traits and common diseases in humans. Typically the effect sizes of SNP alleles are very small and this has led to large genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMA) to maximize statistical power. A trend towards ever-larger GWAMA is likely to continue, yet dealing with summary statistics from hundreds of cohorts increases logistical and quality control problems, including unknown sample overlap, and these can lead to both false positive and false negative findings. In this study we propose a new set of metrics and visualization tools for GWAMA, using summary statistics from cohort-level GWASs. We proposed a pair of methods in examining the concordance between demographic information and summary statistics. In method I, we use the population genetics Fst statistic to verify the genetic origin of each cohort and their geographic location, and demonstrate using GWAMA data from the GIANT Consortium that geographic locations of cohorts can be recovered and outlier cohorts can be detected. In method II, we conduct principal component analysis based on reported allele frequencies, and is able to recover the ancestral information for each cohort. In addition, we propose a new statistic that uses the reported allelic effect sizes and their standard errors to identify significant sample overlap or heterogeneity between pairs of cohorts. Finally, to quantify unknown sample overlap across all pairs of cohorts we propose a method that uses randomly generated genetic predictors that does not require the sharing of individual-level genotype data and does not breach individual privacy."
10.1101/033738,"Recombinant Sindbis viruses are important tools in neuroscience because they combine rapid and high transgene expression with a capacity to carry large transgenes. Currently, two packaging systems based on the DH(26S)5SIN and the DH-BB(tRNA;TE12) Defective Helper (DH) RNAs are available for making recombinant Sindbis virus that is neurotropic (able to infect neurons and potentially other cells). Both systems produce a fraction of viral particles that can propagate beyond the primary infected neuron. When injected into mouse brains, viruses produced using these DH RNAs label neurons at the injection site, but also elsewhere in the brain. Such ectopic labeling caused recombinant Sindbis viruses to be classified as anterograde viruses with limited retrograde spread, and can complicate the interpretation of neuroanatomical and other experiments.\n\nHere we describe a new DH RNA, DH-BB(5SIN;TE12ORF), that can be used to produce virus that is both neurotropic and propagation-incompetent. We show in mice that DH-BB(5SIN;TE12ORF)- packaged virus eliminates infection of cells outside the injection site. We also provide evidence that ectopically labeled cells observed in previous experiments with recombinant Sindbis virus resulted from secondary infection by propagation-competent virus, rather than from inefficient retrograde spread.\n\nVirus produced with our new packaging system retains all the advantages of previous recombinant Sindbis viruses, but minimizes the risks of confounding results with unwanted ectopic labeling. It should therefore be considered in future studies in which a neurotropic, recombinant Sindbis virus is needed."
10.1101/033753,"The response of gene expression to intra-and extra-cellular cues is largely mediated through changes in the activity of transcription factors (TFs), whose sequence specificities are largely known. However, the rules by which promoters decode the amount of active TF into gene expression are not well understood. Here, we measure the activity of 6500 designed promoters at six different levels of TF activity in budding yeast. We observe that maximum promoter activity is determined by TF activity and not by the number of sites. Surprisingly, the addition of an activator-binding site often reduces expression. A thermodynamic model that incorporates competition between neighboring binding sites for a local pool of TF molecules explains this behavior and accurately predicts both absolute expression and the amount by which addition of a site increases or reduces expression. Taken together, our findings support a model in which neighboring binding sites interact competitively when TF is limiting but otherwise act additively\n\nSignificance StatementIn response to intracellular and extracellular signals organisms alter the concentration and activity of transcription factors (TFs), proteins that regulate gene expression. However, the molecular mechanisms that determine the response of a target promoter to changes in the number of active TF molecules are not well understood. By combining mathematical modeling with measurements of TF dose-response curves for thousands of designed promoters, we show that competition for active TF molecules is a major factor in determining gene expression. At low TF concentrations additional activator-binding sites within a promoter can actually reduce expression. Thermodynamic modeling suggests that steric hindrance between neighboring binding sites cannot explain this behavior, but that competition for limiting TF molecules can."
10.1101/033845,"Organismal functions are size-dependent whenever body surfaces supply body volumes. Larger organisms can develop strongly folded internal surfaces for enhanced diffusion, but in many cases areas cannot be folded so that their enlargement is constrained by anatomy, presenting a problem for larger animals. Here, we study the allometry of adhesive pad area in 225 climbing animal species, covering more than seven orders of magnitude in weight. Across all taxa, adhesive pad area showed extreme positive allometry and scaled with weight, implying a 200-fold increase of relative pad area from mites to geckos. However, allometric scaling coefficients for pad area systematically decreased with taxonomic level, and were close to isometry when evolutionary history was accounted for, indicating that the substantial anatomical changes required to achieve increases in relative pad area are limited by phylogenetic constraints. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found that the departure from isometry is almost exclusively caused by large differences in size-corrected pad area between arthropods and vertebrates. To mitigate the expected decrease of weight-specific adhesion within closely related taxa where pad area scaled close to isometry, data for several taxa suggest that the pads adhesive strength increased for larger animals. The combination of adjustments in relative pad area for distantly related taxa and changes in adhesive strength for closely related groups helps explain how climbing with adhesive pads has evolved in animals varying over seven orders of magnitude in body weight. Our results illustrate the size limits of adhesion-based climbing, with profound implications for large-scale bio-inspired adhesives."
10.1101/033852,"Measures of population differentiation, such as FST, are traditionally derived from the partition of diversity within and between populations. However, the emergence of population clusters from multilocus analysis is a function of genetic structure (departures from panmixia) rather than of diversity. If the populations are close to panmixia, slight differences between the mean pairwise distance within and between populations (low FST) can manifest as strong separation between the populations, thus population clusters are often evident even when the vast majority of diversity is partitioned within populations rather than between them. For any given FST value, clusters can be tighter (more panmictic) or looser (more stratified), and in this respect higher FST does not always imply stronger differentiation. In this study we propose a measure for the partition of structure, denoted EST, which is more consistent with results from clustering schemes. Crucially, our measure is based on a statistic of the data that is a good measure of internal structure, mimicking the information extracted by unsupervised clustering or dimensionality reduction schemes. To assess the utility of our metric, we ranked various human (HGDP) population pairs based on FST and EST and found substantial differences in ranking order. In some cases examined, most notably among isolated Amazonian tribes, EST ranking seems more consistent with demographic, phylogeographic and linguistic measures of classification compared to FST. Thus, EST may at times outperform FST in identifying evolutionary significant differentiation."
10.1101/033829,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are a heterogeneous group of cancers affecting multiple subsites, including oral cavity. Oral or anterior tongue tumors (OTSCC) are an aggressive group of squamous cell carcinomas, characterized by their early spread to lymph nodes and higher rate of regional failure compared to other oral cavity cancers. There is a rise in the incidence of oral tongue cancer among younger population (<50yrs); many of who lack the typical associated risk factors of alcohol and/or tobacco exposure. In order to carry out an ensemble learning and prediction method with multiple parameters classifying survival, we generated data, on somatic mutations in genes from exome sequencing, immediate upstream and downstream flanking nucleotides of the somatic mutations, DNA methylation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), copy number variations (CNV), gene expression, significant pathways altered and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection, from 50 OTSCC patients. Results of our analysis identified somatic mutations in NOTCH2 and/or TP53, and/or LOH in 11p to associate with better disease free survival in HPV positive patients (P = 0.0254) and not in HPV negative patients (P = 0.414). We validated the latter in patients without HPV infection from TCGA cohort (P = 0.369, N = 17 for TCGA_ OralTongue; P = 0.472, N = 67 for all TCGA_HNSCC patients). Integrated analysis, including pathways, linked survival with apoptosis and aberrant methylation in SLC38A8 (P = 0.0129).\n\nAuthor SummaryOral tongue squamous cell carcinomas (OTSCC) are a homogenous group of head and neck tumors characterized with aggressive behavior among younger patients. In this report, we have analysed genetic variants, expression and DNA methylation changes across 50 oral tongue primary tumors along with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection status in those tumors to identify factors associated with disease free survival. Our data identified somatic mutations in the genes NOTCH2, TP53 and LOH in 11p, to be significantly associated with better disease free survival in HPV positive patients (P = 0.0254), but not in HPV negative patients (P = 0.414).

10.1101/033811,"Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) additions to soils can have large impacts on soil organic C (SOC) cycling. Because the soil microbial community drives SOC fluxes, understanding how PyOM additions affect soil microbes is essential to understanding how PyOM affects SOC. We studied SOC dynamics and surveyed soil microbial communities after OM additions in a field experiment. We produced and applied either 350{degrees}C corn stover PyOM or an equivalent amount of dried corn stover to a Typic Fragiudept soil. Stover increased SOC-derived and total CO2 fluxes (up to 6x), and caused rapid and persistent changes in bacterial community composition over 82 days. In contrast, PyOM only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes (up to 2x) and caused fewer changes in bacterial community composition. 70% of the OTUs that increased in response to PyOM additions also responded to stover additions. These OTUs likely thrive on easily-mineralizable C that is found both in stover and, to a lesser extent, in PyOM. In contrast, we also identified unique PyOM-responders, which may respond to substrates such as polyaromatic C. In particular, members of Gemmatimonadetes tended to increase in relative abundance in response to PyOM but not to fresh organic matter. We identify taxa to target for future investigations of the mechanistic underpinnings of ecological phenomena associated with PyOM additions to soil."
10.1101/033878,"Structural connectivity among cortical areas provides the substrate for information exchange in the brain and is characterized by the presence or absence of connections between specific areas. What principles govern this cortical wiring diagram? Here, we investigate the relation of physical distance and cytoarchitecture with the connectional architecture of the mouse cortex. Moreover, we examine the relation between patterns of ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis reveals a mirrored and attenuated organization of contralateral connections when compared to ipsilateral connections. Both spatial proximity and cytoarchitectonic similarity of cortical areas are related to the presence or absence of connections. Notably, our analysis demonstrated that these factors conjointly relate better to cortico-cortical connectivity than each factor in isolation, and that the two factors contribute differently to ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity. Distance is more tightly related to the presence or absence of ipsilateral connections, but its contribution greatly diminishes for contralateral connections, while the contribution of cytoarchitectonic similarity remains stable. Our results, conjointly with similar findings in the cat and macaque cortex, suggest that a common set of principles underlies the macroscale wiring of mammalian brains."
10.1101/033902,"Population expansions trigger many biomedical and ecological transitions, from tumor growth to invasions of non-native species. Although population spreading often selects for more invasive phenotypes, we show that this outcome is far from inevitable. In cooperative populations, mutations reducing dispersal have a competitive advantage. Such mutations then steadily accumulate at the expansion front bringing invasion to a halt. Our findings are a rare example of evolution driving the population into an unfavorable state and could lead to new strategies to combat unwelcome invaders. In addition, we obtain an exact analytical expression for the fitness advantage of mutants with different dispersal rates.\n\nPACS numbers: 87.23.Kg, 05.60.Cd, 64.60.-i, 87.23.Cc"
10.1101/033886,"Most spontaneous mutations affecting fitness are likely to be deleterious, but the strength of selection acting on them might be impacted by environmental stress. Such stress-dependent selection could expose hidden genetic variation, which in turn might increase the adaptive potential of stressed populations. On the other hand, this variation might represent a genetic load and thus lead to population extinction under stress. Previous studies to determine the link between stress and mutational effects on fitness, however, have produced inconsistent results. Here, we determined the net change in fitness in 29 genotypes of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that accumulated mutations in the near absence of selection for approximately 1,000 generations across two stress gradients, increasing NaCl and decreasing phosphate. We found mutational effects to be magnified under extremely stressful conditions, but such effects were specific both to the type of stress as well as to the genetic background. The detection of stress-dependent fitness effects of mutations depended on accurately scaling relative fitness measures by generation times, thus offering an explanation for the inconsistencies among previous studies."
10.1101/033894,"Along with the development of several large-scale methods such as mass spectrometry or micro arrays, genome wide models became not only a possibility but an obvious tool for theoretical biologists to integrate and analyse complex biological data. Nevertheless, incorporating the dynamics of photosynthesis remains one of the major challenges while reconstructing metabolic networks of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. In this review, we aim to provide arguments that small-scale models are still a suitable choice when it comes to discover organisational principles governing the design of biological systems. We give a brief overview of recent modelling efforts in understanding the interplay between rapid, photoprotective mechanisms and the redox balance within the thylakoid membrane, discussing the applicability of a reductionist approach in modelling self-regulation in plants, and outline possible directions for further research."
10.1101/033928,"A recent study conducted the first genome-wide scan for selection in Inuit from Greenland using SNP chip data. Here, we report that selection in the region with the second most extreme signal of positive selection in Greenlandic Inuit favored a deeply divergent haplotype that is closely related to the sequence in the Denisovan genome, and was likely introgressed from an archaic population. The region contains two genes, WARS2 and TBX15, and has previously been associated with adipose tissue differentiation and body-fat distribution in humans. We show that the adaptively introgressed allele has been under selection in a much larger geographic region than just Greenland. Furthermore, it is associated with changes in expression of WARS2 and TBX15 in multiple tissues including the adrenal gland and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and with regional DNA methylation changes in TBX15."
10.1101/033936,"Unlike the autosomes, recombination between the X chromosome and Y chromosome often thought to be constrained to two small pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) at the tips of each sex chromosome. The PAR1 spans the first 2.7 Mb of the proximal arm of the human sex chromosomes, while the much smaller PAR2 encompasses the distal 320 kb of the long arm of each sex chromosome. In addition to the PAR1 and PAR2, there is a human-specific X-transposed region that was duplicated from the X to the Y. The X-transposed region is often not excluded from X-specific analyses, unlike the PARs, because it is not thought to routinely recombine. Genetic diversity is expected to be higher in recombining regions than in non-recombining regions because recombination reduces the effect of linked selection. In this study, we investigate patterns of genetic diversity in noncoding regions across the entire X chromosome of a global sample of 26 unrelated genetic females. We observe that genetic diversity in the PAR1 is significantly greater than the non-recombining regions (nonPARs). However, rather than an abrupt drop in diversity at the pseudoautosomal boundary, there is a gradual reduction in diversity from the recombining through the non-recombining region, suggesting that recombination between the human sex chromosomes spans across the currently defined pseudoautosomal boundary. In contrast, diversity in the PAR2 is not significantly elevated compared to the nonPAR, suggesting that recombination is not obligatory in the PAR2. Finally, diversity in the X-transposed region is higher than the surrounding nonPAR regions, providing evidence that recombination may occur with some frequency between the X and Y in the XTR."
10.1101/033944,"Human migration and human isolation serve as the driving forces of modern human civilization. Recent migrations of long isolated populations have resulted in genetically admixed populations. The history of population admixture is generally complex; however, understanding the admixture process is critical to both evolutionary and medical studies. Here, we utilized admixture induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) to infer occurrence of continuous admixture events, which is common for most existing admixed populations. Unlike previous studies, we expanded the typical continuous admixture model to a more general admixture scenario with isolation after a certain duration of continuous gene flow. Based on the extended models, we developed a method based on weighted LD to infer the admixture history considering continuous and complex demographic process of gene flow between populations. We evaluated the performance of the method by computer simulation and applied our method to real data analysis of a few well-known admixed populations."
10.1101/033910,"We provide evidence that decisions are made by consulting memories for individual past experiences, and that this process can be biased in favor of past choices using incidental reminders. First, in a standard rewarded choice task, we show that a model that estimates value at decision-time using individual samples of past outcomes fits choices and decision-related neural activity better than a canonical incremental learning model. In a second experiment, we bias this sampling process by incidentally reminding participants of individual past decisions. The next decision after a reminder shows a strong influence of the action taken and value received on the reminded trial. These results provide new empirical support for a decision architecture that relies on samples of individual past choice episodes rather than incrementally averaged rewards in evaluating options, and has suggestive implications for the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms."

Specifically, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the worst prognosis, as it is more invasive and lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors that can be targeted with therapies. Due to the need for effective therapies for this type of breast cancer, it is critical to develop methods to (1) understand how TNBC progresses and (2) facilitate development of effective therapies. Here, we describe a multiscale model focusing on tumor formation. Our approach uses multiple scales to investigate the progression and possible treatments of tumors."
10.1101/033969,"Elucidating the genetic, and neuronal bases for learned behavior is a central problem in neuroscience. A leading system for neurogenetic discovery is the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster; fly memory research has identified genes and circuits that mediate aversive and appetitive learning. However, methods to study adaptive food-seeking behavior in this animal have lagged decades behind rodent feeding analysis, largely due to the challenges presented by their small scale. There is currently no method to dynamically control flies access to food. In rodents, protocols that use dynamic food delivery are a central element of experimental paradigms that date back to the influential work of Skinner. This method is still commonly used in the analysis of learning, memory, addiction, feeding, and many other subjects in experimental psychology. The difficulty of microscale food delivery means this is not a technique used in fly behavior. In the present manuscript we describe a microfluidic chip integrated with machine vision and automation to dynamically control defined liquid food presentations and sensory stimuli. Strikingly, repeated presentations of food at a fixed location produced improvements in path efficiency during food approach. This shows that improved path choice is a learned behavior. Active control of food availability using this microfluidic system is a valuable addition to the methods currently available for the analysis of learned feeding behavior in flies."
10.1101/033985,"All experimental assay data contains error, but the magnitude, type, and primary origin of this error is often not obvious. Here, we describe a simple set of assay modeling techniques based on the bootstrap principle that allow sources of error and bias to be simulated and propagated into assay results. We demonstrate how deceptively simple operations--such as the creation of a dilution series with a robotic liquid handler--can significantly amplify imprecision and even contribute substantially to bias. To illustrate these techniques, we review an example of how the choice of dispensing technology can impact assay measurements, and show how large contributions to discrepancies between assays can be easily understood and potentially corrected for. These simple modeling techniques--illustrated with an accompanying IPython notebook--can allow modelers to understand the expected error and bias in experimental datasets, and even help experimentalists design assays to more effectively reach accuracy and imprecision goals."

However, the specific factors that determine habitat variability remain unclear at higher levels of biological organization (e.g., biochemical networks). One widely accepted hypothesis developed from both theoretical and empirical analyses is that habitat variability promotes network modularity; however, this relationship has not yet been directly tested in higher organisms. Therefore, I investigated the relationship between habitat variability and metabolic network modularity using compound and enzymatic networks in flies and mammals. Contrary to expectation, there was no clear positive correlation between habitat variability and network modularity. As an exception, the network modularity increased with habitat variability in the enzymatic networks of flies. However, the observed association was likely an artifact, and the frequency of gene duplication appears to be the main factor contributing to network modularity. These findings raise the question of whether or not there is a general mechanism for habitat range expansion at a higher level (i.e., above the gene scale). This study suggests that the currently widely accepted hypothesis for habitat variability should be reconsidered."
10.1101/034041,"The effect of fluctuating environmental conditions (i.e. environmental stochasticity) on the evolution of virulence has been broadly overlooked, presumably due to a lack of connection between the fields of evolutionary epidemiology and insect ecology. Practitioners of the latter have known for a long time that stochastic environmental variations can impact the population dynamics of many insects, some of which are vectors of infectious diseases. Here we investigate whether environmental stochasticity affecting a vectors life history can have an indirect impact on the evolutionarily expected virulence of the parasite, using Chagas disease as an example. We model the evolution of virulence using the adaptive dynamics framework, showing that parasite virulence should decrease when the vector's dynamics randomly change in time. The decrease is even more pronounced when environmental variations are frequent and ample. This decrease in virulence can be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy: when a parasite is at a risk of not being transmitted (e.g. because vectors are scarce), its best option is to stay in the host longer - that is, to be less virulent. Lowering virulence is thus very similar to increasing iteroparity, a well-known risk-spreading strategy, and should be expected to evolve whenever parasite transmission varies randomly in time."
10.1101/034017,"The molecular events leading to the development of the bat wing remain largely unknown, and are thought to be caused, in part, by changes in gene expression during limb development. These expression changes could be instigated by variations in gene regulatory enhancers. Here, we used a comparative genomics approach to identify regions that evolved rapidly in the bat ancestor but are highly conserved in other vertebrates. We discovered 166 bat accelerated regions (BARs) that overlap H3K27ac and p300 ChIP-seq peaks in developing mouse limbs. Using a mouse enhancer assay, we show that five Myotis lucifugus BARs drive gene expression in the developing mouse limb, with the majority showing differential enhancer activity compared to the mouse orthologous BAR sequences. These include BAR116, which is located telomeric to the HoxD cluster and had robust forelimb expression for the M. lucifugus sequence and no activity for the mouse sequence at embryonic day 12.5. Developing limb expression analysis of Hoxd10-Hoxd13 in Miniopterus natalensis bats showed a high-forelimb weak-hindlimb expression for Hoxd10-Hoxd11, similar to the expression trend observed for M. lucifugus BAR116 in mice, suggesting that it could be involved in the regulation of the bat HoxD complex. Combined, our results highlight novel regulatory regions that could be instrumental for the morphological differences leading to the development of the bat wing.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe limb is a classic example of vertebrate homology and is represented by a large range of morphological structures such as fins, legs and wings. The evolution of these structures could be driven by alterations in gene regulatory elements that have critical roles during development. To identify elements that may contribute to bat wing development, we characterized sequences that are conserved between vertebrates, but changed significantly in the bat lineage. We then overlapped these sequences with predicted developing limb enhancers as determined by ChIP-seq, finding 166 bat accelerated sequences (BARs). Five BARs that were tested for enhancer activity in mice all drove expression in the limb. Testing the mouse orthologous sequence showed that three had differences in their limb enhancer activity as compared to the bat sequence. Of these, BAR116 was of particular interest as it is located near the HoxD locus, an essential gene complex required for proper spatiotemporal patterning of the developing limb. The bat BAR116 sequence drove robust forelimb expression but the mouse BAR116 sequence did not show enhancer activity. These experiments correspond to analyses of HoxD gene expressions in developing bat limbs, which had strong forelimb versus weak hindlimb expression for Hoxd10-11. Combined, our studies highlight specific genomic regions that could be important in shaping the morphological differences that led to the development of the bat wing."

10.1101/034066,"Hashimotos thyroiditis is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in humans and, similar to other autoimmune diseases, is multifactorial in nature. Moreover, the expression of TLRs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as diabetes and insulinitis. The TLRs are a family of at least 10 receptors associated with innate immunity that are present in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which recognize highly conserved patterns of the surface of microorganisms, such as LPS, peptidoglycan, and dsRNA and CpG sequences.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate mRNA of the TLR3, TLR9 and cytokines (IFN-beta, TNF and IL-1) in thyroid follicular cells obtained of mice with autoimmune experimental thyroiditis (EAT). For that C57BL/6 mice were immunized with Tg plus complete Freunds adyuvant and treated or not with Poli I:C. Anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies level was determined by indirect ELISA. Also isolated thyroid follicles were treated in vitro with Poli IC. The results show that TLR3 receptors and some cytokines (IFN-beta, TNF and IL-10) are more highly expressed in thyroid follicular cells treated with Poli I:C. and in the animals with TAE, which present humoral autoimmune response. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR3 expression in thyroid follicular cells induces signaling mechanisms to enhanced IL-1, TNF and IFN-{beta} levels during pathogen infections and that could trigger of autoimmune thyroiditis."
10.1101/034074,"A symptom of the need for greater reproducibility in scientific practice is the \""decline effect,\"" the fact that the size of many experimental effects decline with subsequent study or fail to replicate entirely. A simple way to combat this problem is for scientists to more routinely use confidence intervals (CIs) in their work. CIs provide frequentist bounds on the true size of an effect and can reveal when a statistically significant effect is possibly too small to be reliable or when a large effect might have been missed due to insufficient statistical power. CIs are often lacking in psychophysiological reports, likely due to the large number of dependent variables, which complicates deriving and visualizing CIs. In this article, I explain the value of CIs and show how to compute them for analyses involving multiple variables in various ways that adjust the intervals for the greater uncertainty induced by multiple statistical comparisons. The methods are illustrated using a basic visual oddball event-related potential (ERP) dataset and freely available Matlab software."
10.1101/032342,"The ability to perform remote, in situ sequencing and diagnostics has been a long-sought goal for point-of-care medicine and portable DNA/RNA measurements. This technological advancement extends to missions beyond Earth as well, both for crew health and astrobiology applications. However, most commercially available sequencing technologies are ill-suited for space flight for a variety of reasons, including excessive volume and mass, and insufficient ruggedization for spaceflight. Portable and lightweight nanopore-based sequencers, which analyze nucleic acids electrochemically, are inherently much better suited to spaceflight, and could potentially be incorporated into future missions with only minimal modification. As a first step toward evaluating the performance of nanopore sequencers in a microgravity environment, we tested the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION in a parabolic flight simulator to examine the effect of reduced gravity on DNA sequencing. The instrument successfully generated three reads, averaging 2,371 bases. However, the median current was shifted across all reads and the error profiles changed compared with operation of the sequencer on the ground, indicating that distinct computational methods may be needed for such data. We evaluated existing methods and propose two new methods; the first new method is based on a wave-fingerprint method similar to that of the Shazam model for matching periodicity information in music, and the second is based on entropy signal mapping. These tools provide a unique opportunity for nucleic acid sequencing in reduced gravity environments. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from the parabolic flight as they would apply to performing DNA sequencing with the MinION aboard the International Space Station."
10.1101/034090,"With the advent of next generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, omics experiments have become the mainstay for studying diverse biological effects on a genome wide scale. ChIP-seq is the omics technique that enables genome wide localization of transcription factor binding or epigenetic modification events. Since the inception of ChIP-seq in 2007, many methods have been developed to infer ChIP target binding loci from the resultant reads after mapping them to a reference genome. However, interpreting these data has proven challenging, and as such these algorithms have several shortcomings, including susceptibility to false positives due to artifactual peaks, poor localization of binding sites, and the requirement for a total DNA input control which increases the cost of performing these experiments. We present Ritornello, a new approach with roots in digital signal processing (DSP) that addresses all of these problems. We show that Ritornello generally performs equally or better than the peak callers tested and recommended by the ENCODE consortium, but in contrast, Ritornello does not require a matched total DNA input control to avoid false positives, effectively decreasing the sequencing cost to perform ChIP-seq."
10.1101/034140,"CRISPR-Cas9 and related technologies efficiently alter genomic DNA at targeted positions and have far-reaching implications for functional screening and therapeutic gene editing. Understanding and unlocking this potential requires accurate evaluation of editing efficiency. We show that methodological decisions for analyzing sequencing data can significantly affect mutagenesis efficiency estimates and we provide a comprehensive R-based toolkit, CrispRVariants and accompanying web tool CrispRVariantsLite, that resolves and localizes individual mutant alleles with respect to the endonuclease cut site. CrispRVariants-enabled analyses of newly generated and existing genome editing datasets underscore how careful consideration of the full variant spectrum gives insight toward effective guide and amplicon design as well as the mutagenic process."
10.1101/034108,"Summary: Visualizing genomic data in chromosomal context can help detecting errors in data generation or analysis and can suggest new hypotheses to be tested. Here we report a new tool for displaying large and diverse genomic data in idiograms of one or multiple chromosomes. The package is implemented in R so that visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic data. It supports simultaneous visualization of multiples tracks of data, each of potentially different nature. Large genomic regions such as QTLs or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic variants, or any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical variables and the user can choose among points, points connected by lines, line segments, barplots or histograms for representing data. chromPlot reads data from tables in BED format which are imported in R using its builtin functions. The information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package. Chromosomes for other organisms are downloaded automatically from the Ensembl website or can be provided by the user. We present common use cases here, and a full tutorial is included as the packages's vignette.\n\nAvailability: chromPlot is distributed under a GLP2 licence at Genomed Lab: http://genomed.med.uchile.cl.\n\nContact: raverdugo@u.uchile.cl"
10.1101/034025,"Understanding the causes of cis-regulatory variation is a long-standing aim in evolutionary biology. Although cis-regulatory variation has long been considered important for adaptation, we still have a limited understanding of the selective importance and genomic determinants of standing cis-regulatory variation. To address these questions, we studied the prevalence, genomic determinants and selective forces shaping cis-regulatory variation in the outcrossing plant Capsella grandiflora. We first identified a set of 1,010 genes with common cis-regulatory variation using analyses of allele-specific expression (ASE). Population genomic analyses of whole-genome sequences from 32 individuals showed that genes with common cis-regulatory variation are 1) under weaker purifying selection and 2) undergo less frequent positive selection than other genes. We further identified genomic determinants of cis-regulatory variation. Gene-body methylation (gbM) was a major factor constraining cis-regulatory variation, whereas presence of nearby TEs and tissue specificity of expression increased the odds of ASE. Our results suggest that most common cis-regulatory variation in C. grandiflora is under weak purifying selection, and that gene-specific functional constraints are more important for the maintenance of cis-regulatory variation than genome-scale variation in the intensity of selection. Our results agree with previous findings that suggest TE silencing affects nearby gene expression, and provide novel evidence for a link between gbM and cis-regulatory constraint, possibly reflecting greater dosage-sensitivity of body-methylated genes. Given the extensive conservation of gene-body methylation in flowering plants, this suggests that gene-body methylation could be an important predictor of cis-regulatory variation in a wide range of plant species."
10.1101/034124,"Because of its clonal evolution a tumor rarely contains multiple genomic alterations in the same pathway, as disrupting the pathway by one gene often is sufficient to confer the complete fitness advantage. As a result mutated genes display patterns of mutual exclusivity across tumors. The identification of such patterns have been exploited to detect cancer drivers. The complex problem of searching for mutual exclusivity across individuals has previously been solved by filtering the input data upfront, analyzing only genes mutated in numerous samples. These stringent filtering criteria come at the expense of missing rarely mutated driver genes. To overcome this problem, we present SSA.ME, a network-based method to detect mutually exclusive genes across tumors that does not depend on stringent filtering. Analyzing the TCGA breast cancer dataset illustrates the added value of SSA.ME: despite not using mutational frequency based-prefiltering, well-known recurrently mutated drivers could still be highly prioritized. In addition, we prioritized several genes that displayed mutual exclusivity and pathway connectivity with well-known drivers, but that were rarely mutated. We expect the proposed framework to be applicable to other complex biological problems because of its capability to process large datasets in polynomial time and its intuitive implementation."
10.1101/033803,"We describe a method to record near-whole brain activity in behaving adult flies. Pan-neuronal calcium and voltage sensors were imaged at high speed with light field microscopy. Functional maps were then extracted by principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Their characteristic shapes match the anatomy of sub-neuropil regions and in some cases a specific neuron type. Responses to light and odor produced activity patterns consistent with previous techniques. Furthermore, the method detected activity linked to behavior as well as a previously uncharacterized pattern of spontaneous activity in the central complex."
10.1101/034116,"Sexual reproduction is a trait shared by all complex life, but explaining its origin and evolution remains a major theoretical challenge. Virtually all theoretical work on the evolution of sex has focused on the benefits of reciprocal recombination among nuclear genes, paying little attention to the dynamics of mitochondrial genes. Here I develop a mathematical model to study the evolution of alleles inducing cell fusion in an ancestral population of clonal proto-eukaryotes. Mitochondrial mixing masks the detrimental effects of faulty organelles and drives the evolution of sexual cell fusion despite the declining long-term population fitness. Cell-fusion alleles fix under negative epistatic interactions between mitochondrial mutations and strong purifying selection, low mutation load and weak mitochondrial-nuclear associations. I argue that similar conditions could have been maintained throughout the eukaryogenesis, favoring the evolution of sexual cell fusion and meiotic recombination without compromising the stability of the emerging complex cell."
10.1101/034157,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sibling species S. paradoxus are known to inhabit temperate arboreal habitats across the globe. Despite their sympatric distribution in the wild, S. cerevisiae is predominantly associated with human fermentations. The apparent ecological differentiation of these species is particularly striking in Europe where S. paradoxus is abundant in forests and S. cerevisiae is abundant in vineyards. However, ecological differences may be confounded with geographic differences in species abundance. To compare the distribution and abundance of these two species we isolated Saccharomyces strains from over 1,200 samples taken from vineyard and forest habitats in Slovenia. We isolated numerous strains of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus as well as small number of S. kudriavzevii strains from both vineyard and forest environments. We find S. cerevisiae less abundant than S. paradoxus on oak trees within and outside the vineyard, but more abundant on grapevines and associated substrates. Analysis of the uncultured microbiome shows that both S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus are rare species in soil and bark samples, but can be much more common in grape must. In contrast to S. paradoxus, European strains of S. cerevisiae have acquired multiple traits thought to be important for life in the vineyard and dominance of wine fermentations. We conclude that S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus currently share both vineyard and non-vineyard habitats in Slovenia and we discuss factors relevant to their global distribution and relative abundance."
10.1101/034132,"Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse."
10.1101/034231,"Eukaryotic cells use microtubule-based intracellular transport for the delivery of many subcellular cargos, including organelles. The canonical view of organelle transport is that organelles directly recruit molecular motors via cargo-specific adaptors. In contrast to this view, we show here that peroxisomes move by hitchhiking on early endosomes, an organelle that directly recruits the transport machinery. Using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans we find that hitchhiking is mediated by a novel endosome-associated linker protein, PxdA. PxdA is required for normal distribution and long-range movement of peroxisomes, but not early endosomes or nuclei. Using simultaneous time-lapse imaging we find that early endosome-associated PxdA localizes to the leading edge of moving peroxisomes. We identify a coiled-coil region within PxdA that is necessary and sufficient for early endosome localization and peroxisome distribution and motility. These results present a new mechanism of microtubule-based organelle transport where peroxisomes hitchhike on early endosomes and identify PxdA as the novel linker protein required for this coupling."
10.1101/034173,"Although >20 common frequency age-related macular degeneration (AMD) alleles have been discovered with genome-wide association studies, substantial disease heritability remains unexplained. In this study we sought to identify additional variants, both common and rare, that have an association with advanced AMD. We genotyped 4,332 cases and 25,268 controls of European ancestry from three different populations using the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip. We performed meta-analyses to identify associations with common variants and performed single variant and gene-based burden tests to identify associations with rare variants. Two protective, low frequency, non-synonymous variants A307V in PELI3 (odds ratio [OR]=0.14, P=4.3x10-10) and N1050Y in CFH (OR=0.76, Pconditional=1.6x10-11) were significantly associated with a decrease in risk of AMD. Additionally, we identified an enrichment of protective alleles in PELI3 using a burden test (OR=0.14). The new variants have a large effect size, similar to rare mutations we reported previously in a targeted sequencing study, which remain significant in this analysis: CFH R1210C (OR=18.82, P=3.5x10-07), C3 K155Q (OR=3.27, P=1.5x10-10), and C9 P167S (OR=2.04, P=2.8x10-07). We also identified a strong protective signal for a common variant (rs8056814) near CTRB1 associated with a decrease in AMD risk (logistic regression: OR = 0.71, P = 1.8x10-07; Firth corrected OR = 0.64, P = 9.6x10-11). This study supports the involvement of both common and low frequency protective variants in AMD. It also may expand the role of the high-density lipoprotein pathway and branches of the innate immune pathway, outside that of the complement system, in the etiology of AMD."
10.1101/034207,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of birth weight have focused on fetal genetics, while relatively little is known about how maternal genetic variation influences fetal growth. We aimed to identify maternal genetic variants associated with birth weight that could highlight potentially relevant maternal determinants of fetal growth.\n\nWe meta-analysed GWAS data on up to 8.7 million SNPs in up to 86,577 women of European descent from the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) Consortium and the UK Biobank. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) and analyses of mother-child pairs to quantify the separate maternal and fetal genetic effects.\n\nMaternal SNPs at 10 loci (MTNR1B, HMGA2, SH2B3, KCNAB1, L3MBTL3, GCK, EBF1, TCF7L2, ACTL9 and CYP3A7) showed evidence of association with offspring birth weight at P<5x10-8. The SEM analyses showed at least 7 of the 10 associations were consistent with effects of the maternal genotype acting via the intrauterine environment, rather than via effects of shared alleles with the fetus. Variants, or correlated proxies, at many of the loci had been previously associated with adult traits, including fasting glucose (MTNR1B, GCK and TCF7L2) and sex hormone levels (CYP3A7), and one (EBF1) with gestational duration.\n\nThe identified associations indicate effects of maternal glucose, cytochrome P450 activity and gestational duration, and potential effects of maternal blood pressure and immune function on fetal growth. Further characterization of these associations, for example in mechanistic and causal analyses, will enhance understanding of the potentially modifiable maternal determinants of fetal growth, with the goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with low and high birth weights."
10.1101/034165,"Copy number variants (CNVs) are known to affect a large portion of the human genome and have been implicated in many diseases. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3,455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease."
10.1101/034256,"Genetic assimilation results from selection on phenotypic plasticity, but quantitative genetics models of linear reaction norms considering intercept and slope as traits do not fully incorporate the process of genetic assimilation. We argue that intercept-slope reaction norm models are insufficient representations of genetic effects on linear reaction norms, and that considering reaction norm intercept as a trait is unfortunate because the definition of this trait relates to a specific environmental value (zero) and confounds genetic effects on reaction norm elevation with genetic effects on environmental perception. Instead we suggest a model with three traits representing genetic effects that respectively (i) are independent of the environment, (ii) alter the sensitivity of the phenotype to the environment, and (iii) determine how the organism perceives the environment. The model predicts that, given sufficient additive genetic variation in environmental perception, the environmental value at which reaction norms tend to cross will respond rapidly to selection after an abrupt environmental change, and eventually become equal to the new mean environment. This readjustment of the zone of canalization becomes completed without changes in genetic correlations, genetic drift or imposing any fitness costs on maintaining plasticity. The asymptotic evolutionary outcome of this three-trait linear reaction norm generally entails a lower degree of phenotypic plasticity than the two-trait model, and maximum expected fitness does not occur at the mean trait values in the population."

10.1101/034223,"Crustaceans are a morphologically, physiologically and ecologically highly diverse animal group and correspondingly diverse are their reproductive characteristics. They have evolved structural specialities with respect to penis construction, sperm form, sperm storage, fertilization and brood care. Unique in the animal kingdom are safety lines that safeguard hatching and first molting. Further curiosities are dwarf males in parasitic and sessile taxa and bacteria-induced gigantism and infectious feminization in crustacean hosts. Record-breaking features in animals are relative penis length, clutch size, sperm size, chromosome number, viability of resting eggs, and fossil ages of penis, sperm and brooded embryos. These reproductive peculiarities are reviewed and their implication for basic and applied biology is discussed, including the early evolution and diversification of brood care in arthropods, sperm competition and assurance of paternity, posthumous paternity and sustainable male-based fishery, and ecotype changes by man-made pollution."
10.1101/034280,"Maintenance of sexual reproduction and genetic recombination imposes physiological costs when compared to parthenogenic reproduction, most prominently: for maintaining the corresponding (molecular) machinery, for finding a mating partner, and through the decreased fraction of females in a population, which decreases the reproductive capacity. Based on principles from information theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic model, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all species maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche and allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea to the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more than compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining populations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to maintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the advantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining populations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison with asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already significantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic complexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity. The model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses about the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red Queen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases population frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones. In addition, we suggest simple explanations for niche-dependent prevalence of transient asexuality and the exceptional asexual lineage of Bdelloid rotifers."
10.1101/034272,"The lifetime of G. biloba is very long, and its growth is relatively slow. However, little is known about growth-related genes in this species. We combined mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to fine map significant agronomic trait genes by developing polymorphism molecular markers at the transcriptome level. RNA-Seq data provides BSA with genotype information in RNA Pool to screen out linked genes (low in false positives) after data analysis, and the efficiency of development and verification of the linked polymorphism marker is greatly improved. This combined approach (named BSR) has been applied to plant transcriptome sequencing in sunflower, corn, wheat, and Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, transcriptome sequencing of high growth (GD) and low growth (BD) samples of G. biloba half-sib families was performed. After assembling the clean reads, 601 differential expression genes were detected and 513 of them were assigned functional annotations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis identified SNPs associated with 119 genes in the GD and BD groups; 58 of these genes were annotated. This study provides molecular level data that could be used for seed selection of high growth G.biloba half-sib families for future breeding programs."
10.1101/034306,"The intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is endemic to parts of southeast Asia and northern Australia, causes the disease melioidosis. Although acute infections can be treated with antibiotics, melioidosis is difficult to cure, and some patients develop chronic infections or a recrudescence of the disease months or years after treatment of the initial infection. B. pseudomallei strains have a high level of natural resistance to a variety of antibiotics, and with limited options for new antibiotics on the horizon, new alternatives are needed. The aim of the present study was to characterize the metabolic capabilities of B. pseudomallei, identify metabolites crucial for pathogen survival, understand the metabolic interactions that occur between pathogen and host cells, and determine if metabolic enzymes produced by the pathogen might be potential antibacterial targets. This aim was accomplished through genome scale metabolic modeling under different external conditions: 1) including all nutrients that could be consumed by the model, and 2) providing only the nutrients available in culture media. Using this approach, candidate chokepoint enzymes were identified, then knocked out in silico under the different nutrient conditions. The effect of each knockout on the metabolic network was examined. When five of the candidate chokepoints were knocked out in silico, the flux through the B. pseudomallei network was decreased, depending on the nutrient conditions. These results demonstrate the utility of genome-scale metabolic modeling methods for drug target identification in B. pseudomallei."
10.1101/034314,"Plants of the Cannabis genus are the only producers of phytocannabinoids, terpenoid compounds that strongly interact with evolutionarily ancient endocannabinoid receptors shared by most bilaterian taxa. For millennia, the plant has been cultivated for these compounds, but also for food, rope, paper, and clothing. Today, specialized varieties yielding high-quality textile fibers, nutritional seed oil or high cannabinoid content are cultivated across the globe. However, the genetic identities and histories of these diverse populations remain largely obscured. We analyzed the nuclear genomic diversity among 340 Cannabis varieties, including fiber and seed oil hemp, high cannabinoid drug-types and feral populations. These analyses demonstrate the existence of at least three major groups of diversity, with European hemp varieties more closely related to narrow leaflet drug-types (NLDT) than to broad leaflet drug-types (BLDT). The BLDT group appears to encompass less diversity than the NLDT, which reflects the larger geographic range of NLDTs, and suggests a more recent origin of domestication of the BLDTs. As well as being genetically distinct, hemp, NLDT and BLDT genetic groups each produce unique cannabinoid and terpenoid content profiles. This combined analysis of population genomic and trait variation informs our understanding of the potential uses of different genetic variants for medicine and agriculture, providing valuable insights and tools for a rapidly emerging, valuable legal industry."
10.1101/034298,"Genome sequencing studies of de novo mutations in humans have revealed surprising incongruities with our understanding of human germline mutation. In particular, the mutation rate observed in modern humans is substantially lower than that estimated from calibration against the fossil record, and the paternal age effect in mutations transmitted to offspring is much weaker than expected from our longstanding model of spermatogenesis. I consider possible explanations for these differences, including evolutionary changes in life history parameters such as generation time and the age of puberty, a possible contribution from undetected post-zygotic mutations early in embryo development, and variation in cellular mutation rates at different stages of the germline. I suggest a revised model of stem cell state transitions during spermatogenesis, in which  dark gonial stem cells play a more active role than hitherto envisaged, with a long cycle time undetected in experimental observations. More generally, I argue that the mutation rate and its evolution depend intimately on the structure of the germline in humans and other primates."
10.1101/034330,"Hypothesis weighting is a powerful approach for improving the power of data analyses that employ multiple testing. However, in general it is not evident how to choose the weights. We describe IHW, a method for data-driven hypothesis weighting that makes use of informative covariates that are independent of the test statistic under the null, but informative of each tests power or prior probability of the null hypothesis. Covariates can be continuous or categorical and need not fulfill any particular assumptions. The method increases statistical power in applications while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and produces additional insight by revealing the covariate-weight relationship. Independent hypothesis weighting is a practical approach to discovery of associations in large datasets."
10.1101/034322,"BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) ranks among the most common cancers in Sudan and worldwide with hefty toll on female health and human resources. Recent studies have uncovered a common BC signature characterized by low frequency of oncogenic mutations and high frequency of epigenetic silencing of major BC tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, we conducted a genome-wide methylome study to characterize aberrant DNA methylation in breast cancer.\n\nResultsDifferential methylation analysis between primary tumor samples and normal samples from healthy adjacent tissues yielded 20188 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), which is further divided into 13633 hypermethylated sites corresponding to 5339 genes and 6555 hypomethylated sites corresponding to 2811 genes. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis revealed epigenetic dysregulation of major developmental pathways including hippo signaling pathway. We also uncovered many clues to a possible role for EBV infection in BC\n\nConclusionOur results clearly show the utility of epigenetic assays in interrogating breast cancer tumorigenesis, and pinpointing specific developmental and viral pathways dysregulation that might serve as potential biomarkers or targets for therapeutic interventions."
10.1101/034348,"Coalescent-based species tree inference has become widely used in the analysis of genome-scale multilocus and SNP datasets when the goal is inference of a species-level phylogeny. However, numerous evolutionary processes are known to violate the assumptions of a coalescence-only model and complicate inference of the species tree. One such process is hybrid speciation, in which a species shares its ancestry with two distinct species. Although many methods have been proposed to detect hybrid speciation, only a few have considered both hybridization and coalescence in a unified framework, and these are generally limited to the setting in which putative hybrid species must be identified in advance. Here we propose a method that can examine genome-scale data for a large number of taxa and detect those taxa that may have arisen via hybridization, as well as their potential \""parental\"" taxa. The method is based on a model that considers both coalescence and hybridization together, and uses phylogenetic invariants to construct a test that scales well in terms of computational time for both the number of taxa and the amount of sequence data. We test the method using simulated data for up 20 taxa and 100,000bp, and find that the method accurately identifies both recent and ancient hybrid species in less than 30 seconds. We apply the method to two empirical datasets, one composed of Sistrurus rattlesnakes for which hybrid speciation is not supported by previous work, and one consisting of several species of Heliconius butterflies for which some evidence of hybrid speciation has been previously found."
10.1101/034389,"The 75 species of Australian honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) are morphologically and ecologically diverse, with species feeding on nectar, insects, fruit, and other resources. We investigated ecomorphology and community structure of honeyeaters across Australia. First, we asked to what degree morphology and ecology (foraging behavior) are concordant. Second, we estimated rates of trait evolution. Third, we compared phylogenetic and trait community structure across the broad environmental gradients of continental Australia. We found that morphology explained 37% of the variance in ecology (and 62% vice versa), and that recovered multivariate ecomorphological relationships incorporated well-known bivariate relationships. Clades of large-bodied species exhibited elevated rates of morphological trait evolution, while members of Melithreptus showed slightly faster rates of ecological trait evolution. Finally, ecological trait diversity did not decline in parallel with phylogenetic diversity along a gradient of decreasing precipitation. We employ a new method (trait fields) and extend another (phylogenetic fields) to show that while species from phylogenetically clustered assemblages co-occur with morphologically similar species, these species are as varied in foraging behavior as those from more diverse assemblages. Thus, although closely related, these arid-adapted species have diverged in ecological space to a similar degree as their mesic counterparts, perhaps mediated by competition."
10.1101/034371,"Multisensory integration is a prerequisite for effective locomotor control in most animals. Especially the impressive aerial performance of insects relies on rapid and precise integration of multiple sensory modalities that provide feedback on different time scales. In flies, continuous visual signalling from the compound eyes is fused with phasic proprioceptive feedback to ensure precise neural activation of wing steering muscles within narrow temporal phase bands of the stroke cycle. This phase-locked activation relies on mechanoreceptors distributed over wings and gyroscopic halteres. Here we investigate visual steering performance of tethered flying fruit flies with reduced haltere and wing feedback signalling. Using a flight simulator, we evaluated visual object fixation behaviour, optomotor altitude control, and saccadic escape reflexes. The behavioural assays show an antagonistic effect of wing and haltere signalling on visuomotor gain during flight. Compared to controls, suppression of haltere feedback attenuates while suppression of wing feedback enhances the animals wing steering range. Our results suggest that the generation of motor commands owing to visual perception is dynamically controlled by proprioception. We outline a potential physiological mechanism based on the biomechanical properties of wing steering muscles and sensory integration processes at the level of motoneurons. Collectively, the findings contribute to our general understanding how moving animals integrate sensory information with dynamically changing temporal structure."
10.1101/034470,"RNA molecules adopt a wide variety of structures that perform many cellular functions, including catalysis, small molecule sensing, and cellular defense, among others. Our ability to characterize, predict, and design RNA structures are key factors for understanding and controlling the biological roles of RNAs. Fortunately, there has been rapid progress in this area, especially with respect to experimental methods that can characterize RNA structures in a high throughput fashion using chemical probing and next-generation sequencing. Here, we describe one such method, selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), which measures nucleotide resolution flexibility information for RNAs in vitro and in vivo. We outline the process of designing and performing a SHAPE-Seq experiment and describe methods for using experimental SHAPE-Seq data to restrain computational folding algorithms to generate more accurate predictions of RNA secondary structure. We also provide a number of examples of SHAPE-Seq reactivity spectra obtained in vitro and in vivo and discuss important considerations for performing SHAPE-Seq experiments, both in terms of collecting and analyzing data. Finally we discuss improvements and extensions of these experimental and computational techniques that promise to deepen our knowledge of RNA folding and function."
10.1101/034421,"MotivationLarge-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only 1,000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression, limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expression of genes.\n\nResultsWe present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based GEO dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms linear regression with 15.33% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than linear regression in 99.97% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2,921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms linear regression with 6.57% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31% of the target genes.\n\nAvailabilityD-GEX is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX.\n\nContactxhx@ics.uci.edu"

In contrast to their proneural activity, their function in neurite growth is poorly understood. Drosophila has a single predicted Ngn homologue called Tap, whose function is completely unknown. Here we show that Tap is not a proneural protein in Drosophila but is required for proper axonal growth and guidance of neurons of the mushroom body (MB), a neuropile required for associative learning and memory. Genetic and expression analyses suggest that Tap inhibits excessive axonal growth by fine regulation of the levels of the Wnt signaling adaptor protein, Dishevelled.\n\nSummaryThe Drosophila Neurogenin homologue, Target of Pox neuro (Tap), prevents axonal overgrowth by regulating the Wnt Planar Cell Polarity pathway adaptor protein Dishevelled."

Recent evidence suggests that the arrangement of stomata on abaxial (lower) and adaxial (upper) leaf surfaces may be an important adaptation in plants, but stomatal traits on each surface likely share developmental pathways that could hamper evolution.\nC_LIO_LIWe reviewed the quantitative genetics of stomatal density to look for loci that (1) affected ab- or adaxial density independently or (2) pleiotropically affected stomatal density on both surfaces. We also used phylogenetic comparative methods to test for independent versus correlated evolution of stomatal traits (density, size, and pore index) on each surface from 14 amphistomatous wild tomato taxa (Solanum; Solanaceae).\nC_LIO_LINaturally occurring and laboratory-induced genetic variation alters stomatal density on one surface without affecting the other, indicating that development does not strongly constrain the spectrum of available mutations.

10.1101/034447,"Multivariate estimates of genetic parameters are subject to substantial sampling variation, especially for smaller data sets and more than a few traits. A simple modification of standard, maximum likelihood procedures for multivariate analyses to estimate genetic covariances is described, which can improve estimates by substantially reducing their sampling variances. This is achieved maximizing the likelihood subject to a penalty. Borrowing from Bayesian principles, we propose a mild, default penalty - derived assuming a Beta distribution of scale-free functions of the covariance components to be estimated - rather than laboriously attempting to determine the stringency of penalization from the data. An extensive simulation study is presented demonstrating that such penalties can yield very worthwhile reductions in loss, i.e. the difference from population values, for a wide range of scenarios and without distorting estimates of phenotypic covariances. Moreover, mild default penalties tend not to increase loss in difficult cases and, on average, achieve reductions in loss of similar magnitude than computationally demanding schemes to optimize the degree of penalization. Pertinent details required for the adaptation of standard algorithms to locate the maximum of the likelihood function are outlined."
10.1101/034215,"Ewing Sarcoma break point region 1 (EWSR1) is a multi-functional RNA-binding protein that is involved in many cellular processes, from gene expression to RNA processing and transport. Translocations into its locus lead to chimeric proteins with tumorigenic activity, that lack the RNA binding domain. With crosslinking and immunoprecipitation we have found that EWSR1 binds to intronic regions that are present in polyadenylated nuclear RNAs, which include the translocation-prone region of its own locus. Reduced EWSR1 expression leads to gene expression changes that indicate reduced proliferation. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with break-apart probes that flanked the translocation-prone region within the EWSR1 locus we found that reduced EWSR1 expression increases the frequency of split signals, indicative of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The response in phosphorylated histone H2AX and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) double-stained foci to the topoisomerase poison camptothecin in cells treated with a control shRNA and with sh-EWSR1 further suggests that EWSR1 functions in the prevention of DNA DSBs. Our data reveal a new function of the EWSR1 member of the FET family and suggest a connection between the RNA-binding activity of EWSR1 and the instability of its own locus that may play a role in malignancy-associated translocations."
10.1101/034454,"Individuals affected by autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are considerably heterogeneous. Novel approaches are needed to parse this heterogeneity to enhance precision in clinical and translational research. Applying a clustering approach taken from genomics and systems biology on two large independent cognitive datasets of adults with and without ASC (n=715; n=251), we find replicable evidence for 5 discrete ASC subgroups that are highly differentiated in item-level performance on an explicit mentalizing task tapping ability to read complex emotion and mental states from the eye region of the face (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test; RMET). Three subgroups comprising 42-65% of ASC adults show evidence for large impairments (Cohens d = -1.03 to -11.21), while other subgroups are effectively unimpaired. These findings delineate robust natural subdivisions within the ASC population that may allow for more individualized inferences and accelerate research towards precision medicine goals."

10.1101/034405,"An ecosystem is generally sustained by a set of integrated physical elements forming a functional landscape unit - ecotope, which supplies nutrients, microclimate, and exchanges matter and energy with the wider environment. To better predict environmental change effects on ecosystems, particularly in critically sensitive regions such as high altitudes, it is imperative to recognise how their natural landscape heterogeneity works at different scales to shape habitats and sustain biotic communities prior to major changes.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, in order to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems.\n\nThree composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained they were: (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics-responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for water body size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarizing geology, slope and fractal order-all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and, (iii) topography, i.e. catchment formation type-driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. While driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept.\n\nThe findings inform on the relative contribution of scale-dependent catchment physical elements to lake ecotope and ecosystem formation in high altitude lakes, which should be considered in any assessment of potentially major deleterious effects due to environmental/climate change.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/034405_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (85K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b92e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198fca4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2801dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8f588_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Lake Bassia at 2275m a.s.l. in the Pyrenees National Park, France, is one of the millions of remote high altitude lakes worldwide whose catchments are likely to experience severe effects due to climate change.

10.1101/034462,"AbstractThe reasons for the evolution and maintenance of striking visual phenotypes are as widespread as the species that display these phenotypes. While study systems such as Heliconius and Dendrobatidae have been well characterized and provide critical information about the evolution of these traits, a breadth of new study systems, in which the phenotype of interest can be easily manipulated and quantified, are essential for gaining a more general understanding of these specific evolutionary processes. One such model is the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, which displays significant elytral spot and color polymorphism. Using transcriptome data from two life stages, adult and larva, we characterize the transcriptome, thereby laying a foundation for further analysis and identification of the genes responsible for the continual maintenance of spot variation in H. axyridis."
10.1101/033951,"The combination of laterally activating and inhibiting feedbacks is well known to spontaneously generate spatial organisation. It was introduced by Gierer and Meinhardt as an extension of Turings great insight, that two reacting and diffusing chemicals can spontaneously drive spatial morphogenesis per se. In this study, we develop an accessible nonlinear and discrete probabilistic model to study simple generalisations of lateral activation and inhibition. By doing so, we identify novel modes of morphogenesis beyond the familiar Turing-type modes; notably, beyond stripes, hexagonal nets, pores, and labyrinths, we identify labyrinthine highways, Kagome lattices, gyrating labyrinths, and multi-colour travelling waves and spirals. The results are discussed within the context of Turings original motivating interest: the mechanisms which underpin the morphogenesis of living organisms."
10.1101/034009,"Multigenerational pedigrees have been developed for free-ranging populations of many species, are frequently used to describe mating systems, and are used in studies of quantitative genetics. Here, we document the development of a 4449-individual pedigree for the Western Hudson Bay subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus), created from relationships inferred from field and genetic data collected over six generations of bears sampled between 1966 and 2011. Microsatellite genotypes for 22-25 loci were obtained for 2945 individuals, and parentage analysis was performed using the program FRANO_SCPLOWZC_SCPLOW, including additional offspring-dam associations known only from capture data. Parentage assignments for a subset of 859 individuals were confirmed using an independent high-density set of single nucleotide polymorphisms. To account for unsampled males in our population, we performed half-sib-full-sib analysis to reconstruct males using the program COLONY, resulting in a final pedigree containing 2957 assigned maternities and 1861 assigned paternities with only one observed case of inbreeding between close relatives. During genotyping, we identified two independently captured two-year-old males with identical genotypes at all 25 loci, showing--for the first time--a case of monozygotic twinning among polar bears. In addition, we documented six new cases of cub adoption, which we attribute to cub misidentification or misdirected maternal care by a female bereaved of her young. Importantly, none of these adoptions could be attributed to reduced female vigilance caused by immobilization to facilitate scientific handling, as has previously been suggested."
10.1101/034181,"How mating affects male lifespan is poorly understood. Using single worm lifespan assays, we discovered that males live significantly shorter after mating in both androdioecious (male and hermaphroditic) and gonochoristic (male and female) Caenorhabditis. Germline-dependent shrinking, glycogen loss, and ectopic expression of vitellogenins contribute to male post-mating lifespan reduction, which is conserved between the sexes. In addition to mating-induced lifespan decrease, worms are subject to killing by male pheromone-dependent toxicity. C. elegans males are the most sensitive, whereas C. remanei are immune, suggesting that males in androdioecious and gonochoristic species utilize male pheromone differently as a toxin or a chemical messenger. Our study reveals two mechanisms involved in male lifespan regulation: germline-dependent shrinking and death is the result of an unavoidable cost of reproduction and is evolutionarily conserved, whereas male pheromone-mediated killing provides a novel mechanism to cull the male population and ensure a return to the self-reproduction mode in androdioecious species. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the shared vs. sex- and species-specific mechanisms that regulate lifespan."

Our contributions are threefold: first, we benchmark two approaches to generate targets for ANN training on an example dataset; second, we investigate many different ANN models to identify the ones with best predictions on chromatin states; third, we test different hyper-parameters and discuss how they affect the machine learning algorithms performance.

10.1101/034603,"Herbivore induced defences are robust, evolve rapidly and activated in plants when specific elicitors, frequently found in the herbivores oral secretions (OS) are introduced into wounds during attack. How these complex induced defences evolve remains unclear. Here, we show that herbivore-induced transcriptomic responses in a wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, display an evolutionary hourglass: the pattern that characterises the transcriptomic evolution of embryogenesis in animals, plants, and fungi. While relatively young and rapidly evolving genes involved in signal perception and processing to regulate defence metabolite biosynthesis are recruited both early (1 h) and late (9-21 h) in the defence elicitation process, a group of highly conserved and older genes involved in transcriptomic regulation are activated in the middle stage (5 h). The appearance of the evolutionary hourglass architecture in both developmental and defence elicitation processes may reflect the importance of robustness and evolvability in the signalling of these important biological processes."
10.1101/034512,"Breakthroughs in genomics have begun to unravel the genetic architecture of schizophrenia risk, providing methods for quantifying schizophrenia polygenic risk based on common genetic variants. Our objective in the current study was to understand the relationship between schizophrenia genetic risk variants and neurocognitive development in healthy individuals. We first used combined genomic and neurocognitive data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC; 4303 participants ages 8 - 21 years) to screen 26 neurocognitive phenotypes for their association with schizophrenia polygenic risk.\n\nSchizophrenia polygenic risk was estimated for each participant based on summary statistics from the most recent schizophrenia genome-wide association analysis (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2014). After correction for multiple comparisons, greater schizophrenia polygenic risk was significantly associated with reduced speed of emotion identification and verbal reasoning. These associations were significant by age 9 and there was no evidence of interaction between schizophrenia polygenic risk and age on neurocognitive performance. We then looked at the association between schizophrenia polygenic risk and emotion identification speed in the Harvard / MGH Brain Genomics Superstruct Project sample (GSP; 695 participants age 18-35 years), where we replicated the association between schizophrenia polygenic risk and emotion identification speed. These analyses provide evidence for a replicable association between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and specific aspects of neurocognitive performance. Our findings indicate that individual differences in genetic risk for schizophrenia are linked with the development of social cognition and potentially verbal reasoning, and that these associations emerge relatively early in development."

Most of the predicted classes correspond closely to known interneuron types, allowing us to predict a large number of novel molecular markers of these classes.

10.1101/034520,"There is an ongoing debate about whether face recognition and object recognition constitute separate domains. Clarification of this issue can have important theoretical implications as face recognition is often used as a prime example of domain-specificity in mind and brain. An important source of input to this debate comes from studies of individuals with developmental prosopagnosia, suggesting that face recognition can be selectively impaired. We put the selectivity-hypothesis to test by assessing the performance of 10 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia on demanding tests of visual object processing involving both regular and degraded drawings. None of the individuals exhibited a dissociation between face and object recognition, and as a group they were significantly more affected by degradation of objects than control participants. Importantly, we also find positive correlations between the severity of the face recognition impairment and the degree of impaired performance with degraded objects. This suggests that the face and object deficits are systematically related rather than coincidental. We conclude that at present, there is no strong evidence in the literature on developmental prosopagnosia supporting domain-specific accounts of face recognition."
10.1101/034561,"The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations."

It is not entirely clear how the scale and physical heterogeneity of surrounding catchment, its ecological composition, and larger landscape gradients work together to sustain littoral communities.\n\nA total of 114 alpine lakes in the central Pyrenees were surveyed to evaluate the functional connectivity between catchment physical and ecological elements and littoral zoobenthos, and ascertain their effect on community formation. At each lake, the zoobenthic composition was assessed together with geolocation (altitude, latitude and longitude), catchment hydrodynamics, geomorphology, topography, riparian vegetation composition, the presence of trout and frogs, water pH and conductivity.\n\nUni- and multidimensional fuzzy set ordination models integrating benthic biota and environmental variables revealed that at geographical scale longitude surpassed altitude in its effect on littoral ecosystem, reflecting a sharp transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean bioregions. Topography (through its control of catchment type, summer snow coverage, and connectivity with other lakes) was the largest catchment-scale driver, followed by hydrodynamics (waterbody size, type and inflow/outflow volumes). Locally, riparian plant composition significantly related to littoral community structure, richness and morphotype diversity. These variables, directly and indirectly create habitats for aquatic and terrestrial stages of invertebrates, and control nutrient and water cycles. Three ecologically diverse associations characterised distinct lake sets. Vertebrate predation, water conductivity and pH (broad measures of total dissolved ions/nutrients and their bioavailability) had no major influence on littoral taxa.\n\nThe work provides exhaustive information from relatively pristine sites, which unveil a strong connection between littoral ecosystem and catchment heterogeneity at scales beyond the local environment.

10.1101/034546,"Adaptation to temporally fluctuating environments can be achieved through evolution of fixed genetic effects, by phenotypic plasticity (either developmental plasticity or trans-generational plasticity), or by randomizing offspring phenotypes (often called diversifying bet-hedging). Theory has long held that plasticity can evolve when information about the future environment is reliable while bet-hedging can evolve when mixtures of phenotypes have high average fitness (leading to low among generation variance in fitness). To date, no study has studied the evolutionary routes that lead to the evolution of randomized offspring phenotypes on the one hand or deterministic maternal effects on the other. We develop simple, yet general, models of the evolution of maternal effects and are able to directly compare selection for deterministic and randomizing maternal effects and can also incorporate the notion of differential maternal costs of producing offspring with alternative phenotypes. We find that only a small set of parameters allow bet hedging type strategies to outcompete deterministic maternal effects. Not only must there be little or no informative cues available, but also the frequency with which different environments are present must fall within a narrow range. By contrast, when we consider the joint evolution of the maternal strategy and the set of offspring phenotypes we find that deterministic maternal effects can always invade the ancestral state (lacking any form of maternal effect). The long-term ESS may, however, involve some form of offspring randomization, but only if the phenotypes evolve extreme differences in environment-specific fitness. Overall we conclude that deterministic maternal effects are much more likely to evolve than offspring randomization, and offspring randomization will only be maintained if it results in extreme differences in environment-specific fitness."

The linkage disequilibrium analysis showed four block within gene KIAA0319 and only the ten-maker haplotype(P=0.013) in block 4 was significantly more common in dyslexia children than in controls. The results indicated that genetic polymorphisms of KIAA0319 are associated with increased risk of developmental dyslexia in Uyghur population."
10.1101/034645,"Gene duplication was proposed by S.Ohno (1) as a key mechanism of a novel gene function evolution. A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \""structure drives function\"" concept at protein and gene levels. The paralogs function diversification forms a so-called \""Cognitive Complement (CC)\"", a product of gene duplication and subsequent cognitive subfunction bifurcation among the NTNG gene duplicates."
10.1101/034413,"A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence."
10.1101/034652,"The plant hormone auxin is perceived by a family of F-box proteins called the TIR1/AFBs. Phylogenetic studies reveal that these proteins fall into four clades in flowering plants called TIR1, AFB2, AFB4, and AFB6 (Parry et al. 2009). Genetic studies indicate that members of the TIR1 and AFB2 groups act as positive regulators of auxin signaling by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors (Dharmasiri et al. 2005; Parry et al. 2009). In this report, we demonstrate that both AFB4 and AFB5 also function as auxin receptors based on in vitro assays. We also provide genetic evidence that both AFB4 and AFB5 are targets of the picloram family of auxinic herbicides. In contrast to previous studies we find that null afb4 alleles do not exhibit obvious defects in seedling morphology or auxin hypersensitivity. We conclude that AFB4 and AFB5 act in a similar fashion to other members of the family but exhibit a distinct auxin specificity."
10.1101/034710,"A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on several general assumptions the evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. Both the deterministic classical equation and the stochastic quantum equation are proposed. The classical equation is written in a form of of second-order differential equations on nucleotide frequencies varying in time. It is proved that the evolutionary equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced logically. Two fundamental constants of time dimension, the quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for characterizing the genome evolution. During speciation the large-scale rapid change of nucleotide frequency makes the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables of the genome largely decreasing or losing. That leads to the occurrence of quantum phase of the evolution. The observed smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the classical and quantum phases. In this theory the probability of new-species formation is calculable from the first-principle. To deep the discussions we consider avian genome evolution as an example. More concrete forms on the assumed potential in fundamental equations, namely the diversity and the environmental potential, are introduced. Through the numerical calculations we found that the existing experimental data on avian macroevolution are consistent with our theory. Particularly, the law of the rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of neoavian birds can be understood in the quantum theory. Finally, the present work shows the quantum law may be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic physics, but also in genome evolution."
10.1101/034629,"Background: Pervasive, 24-hour rhythms from the biological clock affect diverse biological processes in metabolism and behaviour, including the human cell division cycle and sleep-wake cycle, nightly transpiration and energy balance in plants, and seasonal breeding in both plants and animals. The clock mechanism in the laboratory model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana is complex, in part due to the multiple interlocking, negative feedback loops that link the clock genes. Clock gene mutants are powerful tools to manipulate and understand the clock mechanism and its effects on physiology. The LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 genes encode dawn-expressed, Myb-related repressor proteins that delay the expression of other clock genes until late in the day. Double mutant plants (lhy cca1) have low-amplitude, short-period rhythms that have been used in multiple studies of the plant circadian clock.\n\nResults: We used in vivo imaging of several luciferase (LUC) reporter genes to test how the rhythmic gene expression of wild-type and lhy cca1 mutant plants responded to light:dark cycles. Red, blue and red+blue light were similarly able to entrain these gene expression rhythms. The timing of expression rhythms in double mutant plants showed little or no response to the duration of light under 24h light:dark cycles (dusk sensitivity), in contrast to the wild type. As the period of the mutant clock is about 18h, we tested light:dark cycles of different duration (T cycles), simulating altered rotation of planet Earth. lhy cca1 double mutants regained as much dusk sensitivity in 20h T cycles as the wild type in 24h cycles, though the phase of the rhythm in the mutants was much earlier than wild type. The severe, triple lhy cca1 gi mutants also regained dusk sensitivity in 20h cycles. The double mutant showed some dusk sensitivity under 28h cycles. lhy cca1 double mutants under 28h cycles with short photoperiods, however, had the same apparent phase as wild-type plants.\n\nConclusion: Simulating altered planetary rotation with light:dark cycles can reveal normal circadian performance in clock mutants that have been described as arrhythmic under standard conditions. The features rescued here comprise a dynamic behaviour (apparent phase under 28h cycles) and a dynamic property (dusk sensitivity under 20h cycles). These conditional clock phenotypes indicate that parts of the clock mechanism continue to function independently of LHY and CCA1, despite the major role of these genes in wild-type plants under standard conditions.\n\nAccessibility: Most results here will be published only in this format, citable by the DOI.

10.1101/034736,"Cortical networks exhibit \""global oscillations\"", in which neural spike times are entrained to an underlying oscillatory rhythm, but where individual neurons fire irregularly, on only a fraction of cycles. While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a \""prediction error\"" while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is achieved when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code."
10.1101/034744,"Interaction between proteins is a fundamental mechanism that underlies virtually all biological processes. Many important interactions are conserved across a large variety of species. The need to maintain interaction leads to a high degree of co-evolution between residues in the interface between partner proteins. The inference of protein-protein interaction networks from the rapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in systems biology today. We propose here a novel approach based on the Direct-Coupling Analysis of the co-evolution between inter-protein residue pairs. We use ribosomal and trp operon proteins as test cases: For the small resp. large ribosomal subunit our approach predicts protein-interaction partners at a true-positive rate of 70% resp. 90% within the first 10 predictions, with areas of 0.69 resp. 0.81 under the ROC curves for all predictions. In the trp operon, it assigns the two largest interaction scores to the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue interactions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit our approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive rate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions. We use artificial data to show that the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint multiple sequence alignments and analyze how many sequences would be necessary for a perfect prediction if the sequences were sampled from the same model that we use for prediction. Given the performance of our approach on the test data we speculate that it can be used to detect new interactions, especially in the light of the rapid growth of available sequence data."
10.1101/034769,"As sequencing costs associated with fast advancing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies continue to decrease, variant discovery is becoming a more affordable and popular analysis method among research laboratories. Following variant calling and annotation, accurate variant filtering is a crucial step to extract meaningful biological information from sequencing data and to investigate disease etiology. However, the standard variant call file format (VCF) used to store this valuable information is not easy to handle without bioinformatics skills, thus preventing many investigators from directly analysing their data. Here, we present BrowseVCF, an easy-to-use stand-alone software that enables researchers to browse, query and filter millions of variants in a few seconds. Key features include the possibility to store intermediate search results, to query user-defined gene lists, to group samples for family or tumour/normal studies, to download a report of the filters applied, and to export the filtered variants in spreadsheet format. Additionally, BrowseVCF is suitable for any DNA variant analysis (exome, whole-genome and targeted sequencing), can be used also for non-diploid genomes, and is able to discriminate between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Insertions/Deletions (InDels), and Multiple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (MNPs). Owing to its portable implementation, BrowseVCF can be used either on personal computers or as part of automated analysis pipelines. The software can be initialised with a few clicks on any operating system without any special administrative or installation permissions. It is actively developed and maintained, and freely available for download from https://github.com/BSGOxford/BrowseVCF/releases/latest."
10.1101/034777,"SummaryActive protein translation can be assessed and measured using ribosome profiling sequencing strategies. Existing analytical approaches applied to this technology make use of sequence fragment length or frame occupancy to differentiate between active translation and background noise, however they do not consider additional characteristics inherent to the technology which limits their overall accuracy. Here, we present an analytical tool that models the overall tri-nucleotide periodicity of ribosomal occupancy using a classifier based on spectral coherence. Our software, SPECtre, examines the relationship of normalized ribosome profiling read coverage over a rolling series of windows along a transcript against an idealized reference signal. A comparison of SPECtre against current methods on existing and new data shows a marked improvement in accuracy for detecting active translation and exhibits overall high sensitivity at a low false discovery rate.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationSPECtre source code is available for download at https://github.com/mills-lab/spectre.\n\nContact: remills@med.umich.edu"

10.1101/034793,"Microbial populations as well as they biochemical activities are important components of environmental ecosystems, including the human microbiome. Deciphering the genomic content of these complex mixes of species is an important challenge but is essential to fully understand the regulation of their ecological balance. Here we apply meta3C, an experimental and computational approach that exploits the physical contacts between chromosomes to characterize large genomic regions of bacterial species mixed together, on a truly complex ecosystem: the mouse gut microbiota. Meta3C, which was initially described and applied onto controlled mixes of microorganisms, allowed the de novo assembly and scaffolding of numerous bacteria present into this natural mix. Importantly, the scaffolds analyzed exhibit the structural properties expected from typical bacterial chromosomes. Meta3C therefore paves the way to the in-depth analysis of genomic structuration of complex populations."
10.1101/034819,"The certainty that a species is accurately identified is the cornerstone of appearance based classification; however the methods used in classical taxonomy have yet to fully catch up with the digital age. Recognising this, the CO1 algorithm presented on the StripeSpotter platform was used to identify different species and sexes of mosquito wings (Diptera: Culicidae) and honey bee and bumblebee wings (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Images of different species of mosquito and bee wings were uploaded onto the CO1 database and test wing images were analysed to determine if this resulted in the correct species being identified. Out of a database containing 925 mosquito and bee wing images, the CO1 algorithm correctly identified species and sexes of test wing image presented, with a high degree of accuracy (80% to 100% depending on the species and database used, excluding sibling species) highlighting the usefulness of CO1 in identifying medically important as well as beneficial insect species. Using a larger database of wing images resulted in significantly higher numbers of test images being correctly identified than using a smaller database. The hind wings of Hymenoptera provided higher levels of correctly identified results than using the fore wings. The software should be used in conjunction with other identifying criteria (salient morphological features) in addition to the wings. CO1 is a powerful algorithm to use in identifying insect wings in its current form and has great potential if it is adapted and tailored for insect species identification. It is suggested that a primary aim in the digital age should be the production of a  World Wide Database of insect images, where all known insect images can be made available to everyone, with image recognition and species knowledge at its core."
10.1101/034843,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is considered as a major source of innovation in bacteria, and as such is expected to drive adaptation to new ecological niches. However, among the many genes acquired through HGT along the diversification history of genomes, only a fraction may have actively contributed to sustained ecological adaptation. We used a phylogenetic approach accounting for the transfer of genes (or groups of genes) to estimate the history of genomes in Agrobacterium biovar 1, a diverse group of soil and plant-dwelling bacterial species. We identified clade-specific blocks of co-transferred genes encoding coherent biochemical pathways that may have contributed to the evolutionary success of key Agrobacterium clades. This pattern of gene co-evolution rejects a neutral model of transfer, in which neighbouring genes would be transferred independently of their function and rather suggests purifying selection on collectively coded acquired pathways. The acquisition of these synapomorphic blocks of co-functioning genes probably drove the ecological diversification of Agrobacterium and defined features of ancestral ecological niches, which consistently hint at a strong selective role of host plant rhizospheres."
10.1101/034835,"Rett syndrome (RTT) has a complex developmental course over childhood and adolescence. Patients with RTT often have a pre-symptomatic period with no or little outward signs of the disorder, followed by developmental arrest and regression. Following regression, the individuals condition is not static, as they often progress into defined stages with unique neurological symptoms. Similarly, the progression of RTT-like symptoms in female mice heterozygous for a null-mutation has a prodromal and symptomatic period. Change in functional local circuit connectivity was studied using hippocampal slices, assaying Schaffer evoked activity in area CA1 using fast voltage sensitive dye imaging. With this technique the local functional interactions between the excitatory and inhibitory components of the circuit can be characterized. The prodromal period was associated with a shift in extent of excitation into the stratum oriens of the hippocampus and reduced sensitivity to changes in divalent cation concentration. These data suggest that hyperexcitability of the hippocampus at the circuit level may contribute to the prodromal reduction in cognitive performance and the onset of developmental regression."
10.1101/034827,"Octopamine is known to have an appetitive role in odor conditioning paradigms in Drosophila melanogaster. We wanted to test whether octopamine could also act as an appetitive stimulus in courtship conditioning, a paradigm in which training with an unreceptive female (such as a decapitated virgin) causes a subsequent decrease in courtship behavior in male Drosophila. To control octopamine release, we used the Tdc2-Gal4 and UAS-dTRPa1 genes in conjunction to depolarize octopaminergic neurons at 27 C in experimental flies. We hypothesized that inducing octopamine release during courtship training would decrease the aversive impact of training and cause less subsequent suppression of courtship behavior. Our findings confirmed this hypothesis: Tdc2-Gal4/UAS-dTRPa1 flies trained at 27 degrees showed significantly more courtship behavior than controls during testing, and in fact showed no significant effect of courtship training. This confirms that octopamine release counteracts the aversive stimulus of failure to copulate, indicating that octopamine may have an appetitive role in courtship."
10.1101/034900,"Fibrillogenesis, the production or development of protein fibers, has been linked to protein folding diseases. The progress curve of fibrils or aggregates typically takes on a sigmoidal shape witha lag phase, a rapid growth phase, and a final plateau regime. The study of the lag phase and the estimation of its critical timescale provide insight into the factors regulating the fibrillation process. However, methods to estimate a quantitative expression for the lag time rely on empirical expressions, which cannot connect the lag time to kinetic parameters associated with the reaction mechanisms of protein fibrillation. Here we introduce an approach for the estimation of the lag time using the governing rate equations of the elementary reactions of a subsequent monomer addition model for protein fibrillation as a case study. We show that the lag time is given by the sum of the critical timescales for each fibril intermediate in the subsequent monomer addition mechanism and therefore reveals causal connectivity between intermediate species. Furthermore, we find that single-molecule assays of protein fibrillation can exhibit a lag phase without a nucleation process, while dyes and extrinsic fluorescent probe bulk assays of protein fibrillation do not exhibit an observable lag time phase during template-dependent elongation. Our approach could be valuable for investigating the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the protein fibrillation reaction mechanism and provides physicochemical insights into parameters regulating the lag phase."
10.1101/034884,"Transposable elements (TEs) are a major source of genome variation across the branches of life. Although TEs may occasionally play an adaptive role in their hosts genome, they are much more often deleterious, and purifying selection is thus an important factor controlling genomic TE loads. In contrast, life history and genomic characteristics such as mating system, parasitism, GC content, and RNAi pathways, have been suggested to account for the startling disparity of TE loads in different species. Previous studies of fungal, plant, and animal genomes have reported conflicting results regarding the direction in which these genomic features drive TE evolution. Many of these studies have had limited power because they studied taxonomically narrow systems, comparing only a limited number of phylogenetically independent contrasts, and did not address long term effects on TE evolution. Here we explicitly test the long term determinants of TE evolution by comparing 42 nematode genomes that span over 500 million years of diversification, and include numerous transitions between life history states and RNAi pathways. We have analysed the reconstructed TE loads of ancestors through the Nematoda phylogeny to account for correlation with GC content and transitions in TE evolutionary models. We also analysed the effect of transitions in life history characteristics and RNAi using ANOVA of phylogenetically independent contrasts. We show that purifying selection against TEs is the dominant force throughout the evolutionary history of Nematoda, as indicated by reconstructed ancestral TE loads, and that strong stochastic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are the underlying models which best explain TE diversification among extant species. In contrast we found no evidence that life history or RNAi variations have a significant influence upon genomic TE load across extended periods of evolutionary history. We suggest that these are largely inconsequential to the large differences in TE content observed between genomes and only by these large-scale comparisons can we distinguish long term and persistent effects from transient effects or misleading random changes."
10.1101/034959,"The vertebrate adaptive immune system provides a flexible and diverse set of molecules to neutralize pathogens. Yet, viruses such as HIV can cause chronic infections by evolving as quickly as the adaptive immune system, forming an evolutionary arms race. Here we introduce a mathematical framework to study the coevolutionary dynamics of antibodies with antigens within a host. We focus on changes in the binding interactions between the antibody and antigen populations, which result from the underlying stochastic evolution of genotype frequencies driven by mutation, selection, and drift. We identify the critical viral and immune parameters that determine the distribution of antibody-antigen binding affinities. We also identify definitive signatures of coevolution that measure the reciprocal response between antibodies and viruses, and we introduce experimentally measurable quantities that quantify the extent of adaptation during continual coevolution of the two opposing populations. Using this analytical framework, we infer rates of viral and immune adaptation based on time-shifted neutralization assays in two HIV-infected patients. Finally, we analyze competition between clonal lineages of antibodies and characterize the fate of a given lineage in terms of the state of the antibody and viral populations. In particular, we derive the conditions that favor the emergence of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which may be useful in designing a vaccine against HIV."
10.1101/034991,"Palindromic consensus nucleotide sequences are found at the genomic integration sites of retroviruses and other transposable elements. It has been suggested that the palindromic consensus arises as a consequence of structural symmetry in the integrase complex, but the precise mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Here we perform a statistical analysis of large datasets of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 integration sites. The results show that the palindromic consensus sequence is not present in individual integration sites, but appears to arise in the population average as a consequence of the existence of a non-palindromic nucleotide motif that occurs in approximately equal proportions on the plus-strand and the minus-strand of the host genome. We demonstrate that palindromic probability position matrices are characteristic of such situations. We develop a generally applicable algorithm to sort the individual integration site sequences into plus-strand and minus-strand subpopulations. We apply this algorithm to identify the respective integration site nucleotide motifs of five retroviruses of different genera: HTLV-1, HIV-1, MLV, ASLV, and PFV. The results reveal a non-palindromic motif that is shared between these retroviruses."
10.1101/034926,"Speciation often involves the splitting of a lineage and the adaptation of daughter lineages to different environments. It may also involve the merging of divergent lineages, thus creating a stable homoploid hybrid species1 that constructs a new ecological niche by transgressing2 the ecology of the parental types. Hybrid speciation may also contribute to enigmatic and cryptic biodiversity in the sea.3,4 The enigmatic walleye pollock, which is not a pollock at all but an Atlantic cod that invaded the Pacific 3.8 Mya,5 differs considerably from its presumed closest relatives, the Pacific and Atlantic cod. Among the Atlantic cod, shallow-water coastal and deep-water migratory frontal ecotypes are associated with highly divergent genomic islands;6,7 however, intermediates remain an enigma.8 Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of over 200 individuals using up to 33 million SNPs based on genotype likelihoods9 and showed that the evolutionary status of walleye pollock is a hybrid species: it is a hybrid between Arctic cod and Atlantic cod that transgresses the ecology of its parents. For the first time, we provide decisive evidence that the Atlantic cod coastal and frontal ecotypes are separate species that hybridized, leading to a true-breeding hybrid species that differs ecologically from its parents. We refute monophyly and dichotomous branching of these taxa, and stress the importance of looking beyond branching trees at admixture and hybridity. Our study demonstrates the power of whole-genome sequencing and population genomics in providing deep insights into fundamental processes of speciation. Our study was a starting point for further work aimed at examining the criteria of hybrid speciation,10 selection, sterility and structural chromosomal variation11 among cod-fish, which are among the most important fish stocks in the world. The hybrid nature of both the walleye pollock and Atlantic cod raises the question concerning the extent to which very profitable fisheries12,13 depend on hybrid vigour.

10.1101/034983,"The recent availability of large-scale sequence data for the human Y chromosome has revolutionized analyses of and insights gained from this non-recombining, paternally inherited chromosome. However, the studies to date focus on Eurasian variation, and hence the diversity of early-diverging branches found in Africa has not been adequately documented. Here we analyze over 900 kb of Y chromosome sequence obtained from 547 individuals from southern African Khoisan and Bantuspeaking populations, identifying 232 new sequences from basal haplogroups A and B. We find new branches within haplogroups A2 and A3b1 and suggest that the prehistory of haplogroup B2a is more complex than previously suspected; this haplogroup is likely to have existed in Khoisan groups before the arrival of Bantu-speakers, who brought additional B2a lineages to southern Africa. Furthermore, we estimate older dates than obtained previously for both the A2-T node within the human Y chromosome phylogeny and for some individual haplogroups. Finally, there is pronounced variation in branch length between major haplogroups; haplogroups associated with Bantu-speakers have significantly longer branches. This likely reflects a combination of biases in the SNP calling process and demographic factors, such as an older average paternal age (hence a higher mutation rate), a higher effective population size, and/or a stronger effect of population expansion for Bantu-speakers than for Khoisan groups."

However heterozygous CNTNAP2 mutations are also common in the normal population. Conversely, homozygous mutations are rare and have not been found in unaffected individuals.\n\nCase presentationWe describe a consanguineous family carrying a deletion in CNTNAP2 predicted to abolish function of its protein product, CASPR2. Affected family members show epilepsy, facial dysmorphisms, severe intellectual disability and impaired language. We compared these patients with previously reported individuals carrying homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 and identified a highly recognisable phenotype.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that CASPR2 loss produces a syndrome involving early-onset refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, language impairment and autistic features that can be recognized as CASPR2 deficiency disorder. Further screening for homozygous patients meeting these criteria, together with detailed phenotypic investigations will be crucial for understanding the contribution of CNTNAP2 to normal and disrupted development."
10.1101/032821,"Modeling the properties and functions of DNA sequences is an important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics. This task is particularly difficult for noncoding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of noncoding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98% of the human genome is noncoding and 93% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting noncoding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory \""grammar\"" to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models.\n\nAvailability and implementation\n\nAll source code is available at the github repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ."

10.1101/034892,"Electrotaxis plays a critical role in developmental cell migration, axon growth cone guidance, epithelial wound healing, tissue regeneration, and the degree of invasiveness characterizing different cancer cell lines. During electrotaxis in a direct current electric field (EF), a cell migrates preferentially either towards the anode or cathode depending on the cell-type. However, the types and ranges of mechanisms coupling trans-cellular electric fields to cellular EF-sensitive signaling systems are largely unknown. To address this cell biological phenomenon, I use transcriptomic data from a developmental genetic model in which multicellular social aggregation is induced by starvation of amoeboid cells. I find that the developmental proteome expressed during the streaming aggregation stage is measurably and substantially enriched in charged and highly polar amino acids relative to the proteomes of either the unicellular amoeboid or the multicellular fruiting body. This large-scale coding augmentation of EF-sensitive amino acid residues in thousands of streaming-specific proteins is accompanied by a proportional coding decrease in the number of small, uncharged amino acid residues. I also confirm an expected coding increase of biosynthetically costly amino acids in the proteome of the satiated feeding-stage amoeboid. These findings suggest that electrotactic capability is encoded broadly in the genetically regulated deployment of a developmental proteome with augmented EF-sensitivity. These results signify that extreme, nonuniform, evolutionary constraints can be exerted on the amino acid composition of an organisms proteome."
10.1101/034801,"Understanding the sources and sinks of methane (CH4) is critical for predicting and managing global biogeochemical cycles. Recent studies have reported that CH4 concentrations in cave ecosystems are depleted and that these subterranean environments may act as a daily sinks for atmospheric CH4. It has been hypothesized that this CH4 depletion may be caused by radiolysis, an abiotic process whereby CH4 is oxidized via interactions with ionizing radiation derived from radon decay. Alternatively, the depletion of CH4 concentrations could be due to biological processes, specifically oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. We theoretically explored the radiolysis hypothesis and conclude that it is a kinetically constrained process that is unlikely to lead to the rapid loss of CH4 in subterranean environments. We present experimental results to support this claim. We tested the microbial oxidation hypothesis in a set of mesocosm experiments that were conducted in Vietnamese caves. Our results reveal that methanotrophic bacteria associated with cave rocks consume CH4 at a rate of 1.33 - 2.70 mg CH4 {middle dot} m-2 {middle dot} d-1. These CH4 oxidation rates equal or exceed what has been reported in other habitats, including agricultural systems, grasslands, deciduous forests, and Arctic tundra. As such, microbial methanotrophy has the potential to significantly oxidize CH4 in caves, but also smaller-size open subterranean spaces, such as cracks, fissures, and other pores that are connected to and rapidly exchange with the atmosphere. Future studies are needed to understand how subterranean CH4 oxidation scales up to affect regional and global CH4 cycling."
10.1101/034975,"Biomedical vocabularies and ontologies aid in recapitulating biological knowledge. The annotation of gene products is mainly accelerated by Gene Ontology (GO) and more recently by Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Here we report a suite of MeSH packages for chicken in Bioconductor and illustrate some features of different MeSH-based analyses, including MeSH-informed enrichment analysis and MeSH-guided semantic similarity among terms and gene products, using two lists of chicken genes available in public repositories. The two published datasets that were employed represent (i) differentially expressed genes and (ii) candidate genes under selective sweep or epistatic selection. The comparison of MeSH with GO overrepresentation analyses suggested not only that MeSH supports the findings obtained from GO analysis but also that MeSH is able to further enrich the representation of biological knowledge and often provide more interpretable results. Based on the hierarchical structures of MeSH and GO, we computed semantic similarities among vocabularies as well as semantic similarities among selected genes. These yielded the similarity levels between significant functional terms, and the annotation of each gene yielded the measures of gene similarity. Our findings show the benefits of using MeSH as an alternative choice of annotation in order to draw biological inferences from a list of genes of interest. We argue that the use of MeSH in conjunction with GO will be instrumental in facilitating the understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits."
10.1101/034967,"Genomic tools allow the study of the whole genome and are facilitating the study of genotype-environment combinations and their relationship with the phenotype. However, most genomic prediction models developed so far are appropriate for Gaussian phenotypes. For this reason, appropriate genomic prediction models are needed for count data, since the conventional regression models used on count data with a large sample size (n) and a small number of parameters (p) cannot be used for genomic-enabled prediction where the number of parameters (p) is larger than the sample size (n). Here we propose a Bayesian mixed negative binomial (BMNB) genomic regression model for counts that takes into account genotype by environment (G x E) interaction. We also provide all the full conditional distributions to implement a Gibbs sampler. We evaluated the proposed model using a simulated data set and a real wheat data set from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and collaborators. Results indicate that our BMNB model is a viable alternative for analyzing count data."
10.1101/034918,"The thalamus is a key brain element in the processing of sensory information. During the sleep and awake states, this brain area is characterized by the presence of two distinct dynamical regimes: in the sleep state activity is dominated by spindle oscillations (7 - 15 Hz) weakly affected by external stimuli, while in the awake state the activity is primarily driven by external stimuli. Here we develop a simple and computationally efficient model of the thalamus that exhibits two dynamical regimes with different information-processing capabilities, and study the transition between them. The network model includes glutamatergic thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons and gabaergic reticular (RE) neurons described by adaptative integrate-and-fire models in which spikes are induced by either depolarization or hyperpolarization rebound. We found a range of connectivity conditions under which the thalamic network composed by these neurons displays the two aforementioned dynamical regimes. Our results show that TC-RE loops generate spindle-like oscillations and that a critical value of clustering in the RE-RE connections is necessary for the coexistence of the two regimes. We also observe that the transition between the two regimes occurs when the external excitatory input on TC neurons (mimicking sensory stimulation) is large enough to cause a significant fraction of them to switch from hyperpolarization-rebound-driven firing to depolarization-driven firing. Overall, our model gives a novel and clear description of the role that the two types of neurons and their connectivity play in the dynamical regimes observed in the thalamus, and in the transition between them. These results pave the way for the development of efficient models of the transmission of sensory information from periphery to cortex.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe thalamus is known to exhibit two clearly distinct dynamical regimes with different functionalities. During slow-wave sleep the thalamus is dominated by internal activity and is hardly sensitive to external stimuli. In contrast, in the awake state, the thalamus modulates its activity according to the stimuli coming from the periphery. Here we study the conditions regulating the transition between these two states. To that end we implement a simple yet biologically realistic neuronal network model of the thalamus, based on single-neuron models that reproduce the properties of the two prominent types of thalamic neurons, namely thalamocortical relay cells and reticular neurons. We found that when reticular neurons are clustered the network exhibits two distinct dynamical regimes; one dominated by oscillations and insensitive to external stimuli (like sleep) and one sensitive to them (like wake). Moreover we found that the transition between the two regimes is due to the increase of the external excitatory input (corresponding to stronger sensory stimuli)."

10.1101/035097,"MiRNAs are post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression that may additionally reduce the cell-to-cell variability in protein expression, induce correlations between target expression levels and provide a layer through which targets can influence each others expression as  competing RNAs (ceRNAs). Here we combined single cell sequencing of human embryonic kidney cells in which the expression of two distinct miRNAs was induced over a wide range, with mathematical modeling, to estimate Michaelis-Menten (KM)-type constants for hundreds of evolutionarily conserved miRNA targets. These parameters, which we inferred here for the first time in the context of the entire network of endogenous miRNA targets, vary over ~2 orders of magnitude. They reveal an in vivo hierarchy of miRNA targets, defined by the concentration of miRNA-Argonaute complexes at which the targets are most sensitively down-regulated. The data further reveals miRNA-induced correlations in target expression at the single cell level, as well as the response of target noise to the miRNA concentration. The approach is generalizable to other miRNAs and post-transcriptional regulators and provides a deeper understanding of gene expression dynamics."
10.1101/035188,"Eukaryotic genes generate multiple mRNA transcript isoforms though alternative transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation. However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex and not well understood at a global level. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and the resulting translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5' and 3' untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5' untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3' untranslated regions can confer cell-type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels."
10.1101/035105,"We conducted a search for protein truncating variants conferring protection against inflammatory bowel disease exploiting knowledge of common variants associated with the same disease. We found that a protein truncating variant (rs36095412, p.R179X, genotyped in 11,148 ulcerative colitis patients and 295,446 controls, MAF = up to 0.78%) in RNF186, a single-exon ring finger E3 ligase with strong colonic expression, protects against ulcerative colitis (overall P = 6.89x10-7, odds ratio (OR) = 0.30). We further demonstrate that the truncated protein is expressed, suggesting the protective mechanism may reside in the loss of an interaction or function via mislocalization or loss of an essential protein element."

Agent-based models are commonly used to describe the behavior and interaction of individual cells in different environments. Behavioral rules can be informed and calibrated by in vitro assays, and emerging population-level dynamics may be validated with both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Here, we describe the design and implementation of a lattice-based agent-based model of cancer stem cell driven tumor growth."
10.1101/035063,"MotivationCodon models are widely used to identify the signature of selection at the molecular level and to test for changes in selective pressure during the evolution of genes encoding proteins. The large size of the state space of the Markov processes used to model codon evolution makes it difficult to use these models with large biological datasets. We propose here to use state aggregation to reduce the state space of codon models and, thus, improve the computational performance of likelihood estimation on these models.\n\nResultsWe show that this heuristic speeds up the computations of the M0 and branch-site models up to 6.8 times. We also show through simulations that state aggregation does not introduce a detectable bias. We analysed a real dataset and show that aggregation provides highly correlated predictions compared to the full likelihood computations. Finally, state aggregation is a very general approach and can be applied to any continuous-time Markov process-based model with large state space, such as amino acid and coevolution models. We therefore discuss different ways to apply state aggregation to Markov models used in phylogenetics.\n\nAvailabilityThe heuristic is implemented in the godon package (https://bitbucket.org/Davydov/godon) and in a version of FastCodeML (https://gitlab.isb-sib.ch/phylo/fastcodeml)."
10.1101/035006,"The oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans causes potato late blight, and as a potato and tomato specialist pathogen, is seemingly poorly adapted to infect plants outside the Solanaceae. Here, we report the unexpected finding that P. infestans can infect Arabidopsis thaliana when another oomycete pathogen, Albugo laibachii, has colonized the host plant. The behaviour and speed of P. infestans infection in Arabidopsis pre-infected with A. laibachii resemble P. infestans infection of susceptible potato plants. Transcriptional profiling of P. infestans genes during infection revealed a significant overlap in the sets of secreted-protein genes that are induced in P. infestans upon colonisation of potato and susceptible Arabidopsis, suggesting major similarities in P. infestans gene expression dynamics on the two plant species. Furthermore, we found haustoria of A. laibachii and P. infestans within the same Arabidopsis cells. This Arabidopsis - A. laibachii - P. infestans tripartite interaction opens up various possibilities to dissect the molecular mechanisms of P. infestans infection and the processes occurring in co-infected Arabidopsis cells."
10.1101/035022,"The advent of biological data of increasingly higher resolution in space and time has triggered the use of dynamic models to explain and predict the evolution of biological systems over space and time. Computer-aided system modeling and analysis in biology has led to many new discoveries and explanations that would otherwise be intractable to articulate without the available data and computing power. Nevertheless, the complexity in biology still challenges many labs in capturing studied phenomena in models that are tractable and simple enough to analyze. Moreover, the popular use of ordinary differential equation models have their limitations in that they solely capture continuous dynamics, while we observe many discrete dynamic phenomena in biology such as gene switching or mutations. Hybrid systems modeling provides a framework in which both continuous and discrete dynamics can be simulated and analyzed. Moreover, it provides techniques to develop approximations and abstractions of complex dynamics that are tractable to analyze."
10.1101/035071,"Determining the host-parasitoid interactions and parasitism rates for invasive species entering novel environments is an important first step in assessing potential routes for biocontrol and integrated pest management. Conventional insect rearing techniques followed by taxonomic identification are widely used to obtain such data, but this can be time consuming and prone to biases. Here we present a Next Generation Sequencing approach for use in ecological studies which allows for individual level metadata tracking of large numbers of invertebrate samples through the use of hierarchically organised molecular identification tags. We demonstrate its utility using a sample data set examining both species identity and levels of parasitism in late larval stages of the Oak Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea processionea - Linn. 1758), an invasive species recently established in the UK. Overall we find that there are two main species exploiting the late larval stages of Oak Processionary Moth in the UK with the main parasitoid (Carcelia iliaca-Ratzeburg, 1840) parasitising 45.7% of caterpillars, while a rare secondary parasitoid (Compsilura conccinata-Meigen, 1824) was also detected in 0.4% of caterpillars. Using this approach on all life stages of the Oak Processionary Moth may demonstrate additional parasitoid diversity. We discuss the wider potential of nested tagging DNA-metabarcoding for constructing large, highly-resolved species interaction networks."

10.1101/035113,"I use the Nernst equation, parameterised with experimental data, to predict that cancer cells will accumulate more of a lipophilic anion than normal cells. This effect is correlated to charge number. Model cancer cells accumulate *100 more of an anion, *103 more di-anion, *106 more tri-anion, *108 more tetra-anion and *1010 more penta-anion (>>1 billion times more). The trend endures, conveying even greater specificity, for higher charge numbers. This effect could be leveraged for cancer therapy. Wherein the lipophilic anion is a toxin that targets some vital cellular process, which normal and cancer cells may even share. It delivers a high, lethal dose to cancer cells but a low, safe dose to normal cells. This mathematical finding conveys the prospect of a broad, powerful new front against cancer."
10.1101/035238,"SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are genetic markers whose precise identification is a prerequisite for association studies. Methods to identify them are currently well developed for model species, but rely on the availability of a (good) reference genome, and therefore cannot be applied to non-model species. They are also mostly tailored for whole genome (re-)sequencing experiments, whereas in many cases, transcriptome sequencing can be used as a cheaper alternative which already enables to identify SNPs located in transcribed regions. In this paper, we propose a method that identifies, quantifies and annotates SNPs without any reference genome, using RNA-seq data only. Individuals can be pooled prior to sequencing, if not enough material is available for sequencing from one individual. Using human RNA-seq data, we first compared the performance of our method with GO_SCPLOWATKC_SCPLOW, a well established method that requires a reference genome. We showed that both methods predict SNPs with similar accuracy. We then validated experimentally the predictions of our method using RNA-seq data from two non-model species. The method can be used for any species to annotate SNPs and predict their impact on proteins. We further enable to test for the association of the identified SNPs with a phenotype of interest."
10.1101/035121,"Following Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD) occurring at a single locus and linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two loci in generations, we here proposed the third genetic disequilibrium in population: recombination disequilibrium (RD). RD is a measurement of crossover interference among multiple loci in a random mating population. In natural populations besides recombination interference, RD may also be due to selection, mutation, gene conversion, drift and/or migration. Therefore, similarly to LD, RD will also reflect the history of natural selection and mutation. In breeding populations, RD purely results from recombination interference and hence can be used to build or evaluate and correct a linkage map. Several practical examples from F2, testcross and human populations indeed demonstrate that RD is useful for measuring recombination interference between two short intervals and evaluating linkage maps. As with LD, RD will be important for studying genetic mapping, association of haplotypes with disease, plant breading and population history."
10.1101/035139,"Despite their pivotal role in agriculture and biological research, polyploids, a group of organisms with more than two sets of chromosomes, are very difficult to study. Increasing studies have used high-density genetic linkage maps to investigate the genome structure and function of polyploids and to identify genes underlying polyploid traits. However, although models for linkage analysis have been well established for diploids, with some essential modifications for tetraploids, no models have been available thus far for polyploids at higher ploidy levels. The linkage analysis of polyploids typically requires knowledge about their meiotic mechanisms, depending on the origin of polyplody. Here we describe a computational modeling framework for linkage analysis in allohexaploids by integrating their preferential chromosomal-pairing meiotic feature into a mixture model setting. The framework, implemented with the EM algorithm, allows the simultaneous estimates of preferential pairing factors and the recombination fraction. We investigated statistical properties of the framework through extensive computer simulation and validated its usefulness and utility by analyzing a real data from a full-sib family of allohexaploid persimmon. Our attempt in linkage analysis of allohexaploids by incorporating their meiotic mechanism lays a foundation for allohexaploid genetic mapping and also provides a new horizon to explore allohexaploid parental kinship."
10.1101/035220,"While the CCA sequence at the mature 3 end of tRNAs is conserved and critical for translational function, a genetic template for this sequence is not always contained in tRNA genes. In eukaryotes and archaea, the CCA ends of tRNAs are synthesized post-transcriptionally by CCA-adding enzymes. In bacteria, tRNA genes template CCA sporadically. In order to understand variation in how prokaryotic tRNA genes template CCA, we re-annotated tRNA genes in the tRNAdb-CE database. Among 132,129 prokaryotic tRNA genes, initiator tRNA genes template CCA at the highest average frequency (74.1%) over all functional classes except selenocysteine and pyrrolysine tRNA genes (88.1% and 100% respectively). Across bacterial phyla and a wide range of genome sizes, many lineages exist in which predominantly initiator tRNA genes template CCA. Preferential retention of CCA in initiator tRNA genes evolved multiple times during reductive genome evolution in Bacteria. Also, in a majority of cyanobacterial and actinobacterial genera, predominantly initiator tRNA genes template CCA. We suggest that cotranscriptional synthesis of initiator tRNA CCA 3 ends can complement inefficient processing of initiator tRNA precursors, \""bootstrap\"" rapid initiation of protein synthesis from a non-growing state, or contribute to an increase in cellular growth rates by reducing overheads of mass and energy to maintain nonfunctional tRNA precursors. More generally, CCA templating in structurally non-conforming tRNA genes can afford cells robustness and greater plasticity to respond rapidly to environmental changes and stimuli."

10.1101/035212,"Negative and positive experiences can exert a strong influence on later memory. Our emotional experiences are composed of many different elements - people, place, things - most of them neutral. Do emotional experiences lead to enhanced long-term for these neutral elements as well? Demonstrating a lasting effect of emotion on memory is particularly important if memory for emotional events is to adaptively guide behavior days, weeks, or years later. We thus tested whether aversive experiences modulate very long-term episodic memory in an fMRI experiment. Participants experienced episodes of high or low pain in conjunction with the presentation of incidental, trial-unique neutral object pictures. In a scanned surprise immediate memory test, we found no effect of pain on recognition strength. Critically, in a follow-up memory test one year later we found that pain significantly enhanced memory. Neurally, we provide a novel demonstration of activity predicting memory one year later, whereby greater insula activity and more unique distributed patterns of insular activity in the initial session correlated with memory for pain-associated objects. Generally, our results suggest that pairing episodes with arousing negative stimuli may lead to very long-lasting memory enhancements."
10.1101/035196,"Rewarding experiences exert a strong influence on later decision making. While decades of neuroscience research have shown how reinforcement gradually shapes preferences, decisions are often influenced by single past experiences. Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the influence of single learning episodes. While recent work has proposed a role for episodes in decision making, it is largely unknown whether and how episodic experiences contribute to value-based decision making and how the values of single episodes are represented in the brain. In multiple behavioral experiments and an fMRI experiment, we tested whether and how rewarding episodes could support later decision making. Participants experienced episodes of high reward or low reward in conjunction with incidental, trial-unique neutral pictures. In a surprise test phase, we found that participants could indeed remember the associated level of reward, as evidenced by accurate source memory for value and preferences to re-engage with rewarded objects. Further, in a separate experiment, we found that high reward objects shown as primes before a gambling task increased financial risk-taking. Neurally, re-exposure to objects in the test phase led to significant reactivation of reward-related patterns. Importantly, individual variability in the strength of reactivation predicted value memory performance. Further, local searchlight analyses identified significant reactivation in the ventromedial PFC. Our results provide a novel demonstration that affect-related neural patterns are reactivated during later experience. Reactivation of value information represents a mechanism by which memory can guide decision making."

10.1101/035154,"MotivationThe underlying genomic variation of a large number of pathogenic viruses can give rise to drug resistant mutations resulting in treatment failure. Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of viral quasi-species and the quantification of minority variants in clinical samples; therefore, it can be of direct benefit by detecting drug resistant mutations and devising optimal treatment strategies for individual patients.\n\nResultsThe ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.\n\nAvailabilityThe software and its documentation are available from https://github.com/ICONIC-UCL/pipeline\n\nContactt.cassarino@ucl.ac.uk, pk5@sanger.ac.uk\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online."

More than 40% of the Sequence Read Archive is human data protected by provisions such as dbGaP To analyze dbGaP-protected data, researchers must typically work with IT administrators and signing officials to ensure all levels of security are implemented at their institution. This is a major obstacle, impeding reproducibility and reducing the utility of archived data.\n\nResults: We present a protocol and software tool for analyzing protected data in a commercial cloud. The protocol, Rail-dbGaP, is applicable to any tool running on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce.

The Rail-dbGaP protocol makes explicit for the first time the steps an investigator must take to develop Elastic MapReduce pipelines that analyze dbGaP-protected data in a manner compliant with NIH guidelines. Rail-RNA automates implementation of the protocol, making it easy for typical biomedical investigators to study protected RNA-seq data, regardless of their local IT resources or expertise.\n\nAvailability: Rail-RNA is available from http://rail.bio.

10.1101/035246,"Seed banks are a common characteristics to many plant species, which allow storage of genetic diversity in the soil as dormant seeds for various periods of time. We investigate an above-ground population following a Fisher-Wright model with selection coupled with a deterministic seed bank assuming the length of the seed bank is kept constant and the number of seeds is large. To assess the combined impact of seed banks and selection on genetic diversity, we derive a general diffusion model. We compute the equilibrium solution of the site-frequency spectrum and derive the times to fixation of an allele with and without selection. Finally, it is demonstrated that seed banks enhance the effect of selection onto the site-frequency spectrum while slowing down the time until the mutation-selection equilibrium is reached."
10.1101/035345,"How exponentially growing cells maintain size homeostasis is an important fundamental problem. Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered the adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from birth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among genetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic component in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder principle, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically expressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division time is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a fixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean cell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in timing increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the distribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is independent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in experimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to different newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides further insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions of the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective means become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various modifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder principle. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental findings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations in cell-division timing for size control."
10.1101/035329,"Here we present a method of genome wide inferred study (GWIS) that provides an approximation of genome wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for a variable that is a function of phenotypes for which GWAS summary statistics, phenotypic means and covariances are available. GWIS can be performed regardless of sample overlap between the GWAS of the phenotypes on which the function depends. As GWIS provides association estimates and their standard errors for each SNP, GWIS can form the basis for polygenic risk scoring, LD score regression1, Mendelian randomization studies, biological annotation and other analyses. Here, we replicate a body mass index (BMI) GWAS using GWIS based on a height GWAS and a weight GWAS. We proceed to use a GWIS to further our understanding of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."

10.1101/035352,"Molecular biology increasingly relies on large screens where enormous numbers of specimens are systematically assayed in the search for a particular, rare outcome. These screens include the systematic testing of small molecules for potential drugs and testing the association between genetic variation and a phenotype of interest. While these screens are \""hypothesis-free,\"" they can be wasteful; pooling the specimens and then testing the pools is more efficient. We articulate in precise mathematical ways the type of structures useful in combinatorial pooling designs so as to eliminate waste, to provide light weight, flexible, and modular designs. We show that Reed-Solomon codes, and more generally linear codes, satisfy all of these mathematical properties. We further demonstrate the power of this technique with Reed-Solomonbased biological experiments. We provide general purpose tools for experimentalists to construct and carry out practical pooling designs with rigorous guarantees for large screens."
10.1101/035360,"Phylogenetic trees are routinely visualized to present and interpret the evolutionary relationships of species. Virtually all empirical evolutionary data studies contain a visualization of the inferred tree with branch support values. Ambiguous semantics in tree file formats can lead to erroneous tree visualizations and therefore to incorrect interpretations of phylogenetic analyses.\n\nHere, we discuss problems that can and do arise when displaying branch values on trees after re-rooting. Branch values are typically stored as node labels in the widely-used Newick tree format. However, such values are attributes of branches. Storing them as node labels can therefore yield errors when re-rooting trees. This depends on the mostly implicit semantics that tools deploy to interpret node labels.\n\nWe reviewed 10 tree viewers and 10 bioinformatics toolkits that can display and re-root trees. We found that 14 out of 20 of these tools do not permit users to select the semantics of node labels. Thus, unaware users might obtain incorrect results when rooting trees inferred by common phylogenetic inference programs. We illustrate such incorrect mappings for several test cases and real examples taken from the literature. This review has already led to improvements and workarounds in 8 of the tested tools.

In mammalian cells, H2Bub1 levels are highly correlated with transcription elongation rates, consistent with the general belief that H2Bub1 facilitates the elongation process. Yet, a causative role of H2Bub1 in regulating elongation rates within live cells remains to be proven. Using our recently developed 4sUDRB-seq method, we examined the impact of H2Bub1 downregulation, through silencing of its cognate E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20, on genomewide transcription elongation rates. Surprisingly, H2Bub1 downregulation had no measurable effect on global elongation rates. Instead, it led to upregulation of over 1,000 genes by altering their Pol II pause release times; notably, those genes are characterized by the presence of H2Bub1 in relatively close proximity to the paused Pol II. Conversely, another set of genes was downregulated upon partial H2Bub1 depletion, and in those genes H2Bub1 appeared to be required for efficient recruitment of Pol II to the promoter region. Overall, our data shed new light on the molecular mechanisms by which H2Bub1 regulates gene expression and imply that the role of H2Bub1 in transcription elongation should be reconsidered.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYTranscription elongation is an important component of the gene expression process. Numerous factors and chromatin modifications, including some that are misregulated in various human diseases, have been suggested to regulate transcription elongation. New methods to measure genomewide transcription elongation rates now enable, for the first time, to determine how a specific factor affects transcription elongation and what is the outcome of its misregulation. Using such method, we examined the role of one specific chromatin modification, histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), in regulating transcription. Strikingly, although H2Bub1 is widely believed to serve as a regulator of transcription elongation, its downregulation did not affect genomewide elongation rates. Instead, we found that H2Bub1 regulates the expression of distinct subsets of genes by either promoting recruitment of the transcription machinery or, conversely, favoring the pausing of this machinery shortly after initiation of transcription. Our findings demonstrate that the use of genomewide elongation rate measurements can redefine the true roles of putative transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, they provide a new understanding of the functions of H2Bub1 and its impact on gene expression patterns, which is of particular interest because H2Bub1 is often downregulated in human cancer."
10.1101/035378,"SummaryThe open source environment R is one of the most widely used software for statistical computing. It provides a variety of applications including statistical genetics. Most of the powerful tools for quantitative genetic analyses are stand-alone free programs developed by researchers in academia. SOLAR is the standard software program to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity. solarius allows the user to exploit the variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data. It also parses the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more efficient.\n\nAvailability and implementationsolarius is available on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/package=solarius and on GitHub https://github.com/ugcd/solarius.

10.1101/035337,"In northern Guinea, we sighted two groups of Sousa teuszii (n=25; n=40 dolphins) off the Tristao Islands during exploratory small-boat surveys in 2011-12. Based on these and recent (2013) observations in the contiguous Rio Nunez estuary, we propose a single  Guineas stock, combining the former  Rio do Jeba-Bijagos and South Guinea stocks. Significant mortality of S. teuszii from fisheries interactions is widely recognised however not quantifiable as monitoring effort is sporadic. In Guinea, catches were documented in 2002 (n=1) and in 2011-12 (n=5). Landed specimens were recorded in Cameroon (n=2) and Nigeria (n=2). All individuals were killed in small-scale coastal fisheries, presumably as accidental net entanglements, though directed takes cannot be excluded. All landed dolphins were butchered for human consumption (marine bushmeat). Nigerian fishers indicated also an alternative use as shark bait. If local markets in cetacean bushmeat and bait develop, as in Ghana, that will exacerbate pressures by encouraging directed takes. Catch records in Nigeria and sightings in Togo authenticate both nations as (long-suspected) range states for S. teuszii, a belated documenting of the primary, historical distribution. The Gulf of Guinea stock ( Cameroon dolphins) extends at least from Togo to southern Cameroon, and probably into Equatorial Guinea. However, rare sightings of small groups point to remnant, not thriving, dolphin communities. We anticipate de novo distribution gaps emerging and consolidating, following decades of fisheries interactions and creeping encroachment on once pristine coastal habitat. Developed coastlines in Ghana and Cote dIvoire devoid of records may already constitute such gaps. As the lack or scarcity of records warn about formidable challenges to the long-term survival of S. teuszii, innovative, workable protection measures are needed, soonest. We recommend the implementation of several new border-straddling marine protected areas (cf. Saloum Delta-Niumi National Park Complex) which could bring forth a major conservation effect. Binational involvement bears obvious advantages, from sharing responsibilities and allowing for larger protected areas. Suggested dolphin sanctuary examples could include MPAs straddling borders between Cameroon/Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau/Guinea-Conakry."
10.1101/035444,"DNA regulatory elements contain short motifs where transcription factors (TFs) can bind to modulate gene expression. Although the broad principles of TF regulation are well understood, the rules that dictate how combinatorial TF binding translates into transcriptional activity remain largely unknown. With the rapid advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies and the continuing decline in the associated costs, high-throughput experiments can be performed to investigate the regulatory role of thousands of oligonucleotide sequences simultaneously. Nevertheless, designing high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging. We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine control of how motifs are placed into sequences therefore allowing the user to investigate the rules that govern TF occupancy. MPRA SNP design can be used to investigate the functional effects of single or combinations of SNPs at regulatory sequences. Finally, the Transmutation tool allows for the design of negative controls by permitting scrambling, reversing, complementing or introducing multiple random mutations in the input sequences or motifs."
10.1101/035436,"Sequencing at single-nucleotide resolution using nanopore devices is performed with reported error rates 10.5-20.7% (Ip et al., 2015). Since errors occur randomly during sequencing, repeating the sequencing procedure for the same DNA strands several times can generate sequencing results based on consensus derived from replicate readings, thus reducing overall error rates.\n\nThe method presented in this manuscript constructs copies of a nucleic acid molecule that are consecutively connected to the nucleic acid molecule. Such copies are useful because they can be sequenced by a nanopore device, enabling replicate reads, thus improving overall sequencing accuracy."
10.1101/035477,"BackgroundRepeated clusters of ribosomal genes whose activity results in the nucleolus formation are extremely important in multicellular organism genome. Despite the extensive exploration into vertebrate genomes, in many model objects the ribosomal cluster structure is still underinvestigated. So far, complete description for primary structure of avian ribosomal cluster has not been reported.\n\nResultsThis work represents the first successful assembly of complete chicken ribosome cluster sequence. The sequence was deposited to GenBank under accession number KT445934. The total cluster size from pre-rRNA transcriptional start site to the 3' end of 3ETS amounted to 11444 bp. 18S rRNA gene size is 1823 base pairs, 5.8S rRNA - 157 bp, 28S rRNA - 4443 bp. The 5  ETS spacer core size is 1839 bp, 3ETS - about 350 bp., ITS1 - 2099 bp, and ITS2 - 733 bp. The assembly was validated through in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) analysis on metaphase chromosomes of chicken. ITS1 and ITS2 spacer sequences have been found to have high GC pair content and form secondary structures featuring high melting temperature.\n\nConclusionsDecoding of the chicken rRNA gene cluster sequence extends the use of birds as a model object for exploration into nucleolus organizer region (NOR) regulation and nucleolus functions, e.g. in ontogenesis. This data might also be useful to address certain problems of population and evolutionary genetics."
10.1101/035493,"Currently quantitative RNA-Seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require amplification. However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this effects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates and hence it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads.\n\nHere, we generate and analyse RNA-seq datasets prepared using three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias. Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does not improve accuracy, power or FDR, but can actually worsen them. Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and FDR are only mildly improved. However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes."
10.1101/035451,"To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error back-propagation algorithm. However, in the back-propagation algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the back-propagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the back-propagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output."
10.1101/035519,"Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

10.1101/035527,"The historic developmental hourglass concept depicts the convergence of animal embryos to a common form during the phylotypic period. Recently, it has been shown that a transcriptomic hourglass is associated with this morphological pattern, consistent with the idea of underlying selective constraints due to intense molecular interactions during body plan establishment. Although plants do not exhibit a morphological hourglass during embryogenesis, a transcriptomic hourglass has nevertheless been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we investigated whether plant hourglass patterns are also found post-embryonically. We found that the two main phase changes during the life cycle of Arabidopsis, from embryonic to vegetative and from vegetative to reproductive development, are associated with transcriptomic hourglass patterns. In contrast, flower development, a process dominated by organ formation, is not. This suggests that plant hourglass patterns are decoupled from organogenesis and body plan establishment. Instead, they may reflect general transitions through organizational checkpoints."
10.1101/035501,"The ability to quantify cellular heterogeneity is a major advantage of single-cell technologies. Although understanding such heterogeneity is of primary interest in a number of studies, for convenience, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance factor. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. Using simulated and case study data, we demonstrate that the modeling framework is able to detect differential expression patterns of interest under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, scDD has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and is able to characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach."
10.1101/035485,"Microscopic plankton form the productive base of both marine and freshwater ecosystems and are key drivers of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients. Plankton diversity is immense with representations from all major phyla within the three domains of life. So far, plankton monitoring has mainly been based on microscopic identification, which has limited sensitivity and reproducibility, not least because of the numerical majority of plankton being unidentifiable under the light microscope. High-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes offers a means to identify taxa inaccessible by traditional methods; thus, recent studies have unveiled an extensive previously unknown diversity of plankton. Here, we conducted ultra-deep Illumina sequencing (average 105 sequences/sample) of rRNA gene amplicons of surface water eukaryotic and bacterial plankton communities along a 2000 km transect following the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. Community composition was strongly correlated with salinity for both bacterial and eukaryotic plankton assemblages, highlighting the importance of salinity for structuring the biodiversity within this ecosystem. The distribution of major planktonic taxa followed expected patterns as observed in monitoring programs, but also novel groups to the Baltic were identified, such as relatives to the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi in the northern Baltic Sea. The deep sequencing also enabled accurate enumeration of highly resolved (> 99% identity) operational taxonomic units, which revealed contrasting distribution profiles among closely related populations, reflecting niche partitioning into ecotypes. This study provides the first ultra-deep sequencing-based survey on eukaryotic and bacterial plankton biogeography in the Baltic Sea."
10.1101/034249,"No two ovaries are alike, and indeed, the same ovary can change its architecture from day to day. This is because ovarian follicles are present in different numbers, positions, and states of maturation throughout reproductive life. All possible developmental states of follicles can be represented at any time, along with follicles that have committed to death (termed follicle atresia). Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple Markov chain model of the complex mouse ovary, called \""[O]vSim\"". In the model, follicles can exist in one of three Markov states with stationary probabilities, Hold (growth arrest), Grow, and Die. The probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily are user definable parameters. When the probability of daily growth activation is stationary at 0.005, the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, and the probability of granulosa cell survival is modeled around 0.88, [O]vSim simulates the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles in a fashion that approximates actual biological measurements (e.g., follicle counts). [O]vSim thus offers a starting platform to simulate mammalian ovaries and to explore factors that might impact follicle development and global organ function.\n\nAuthor Summary[O]vSim is a computer simulation of the dynamic growth of mouse ovarian follicles. The program is offered as the beginning of a research and teaching platform to model asynchronous follicle growth and survival or death."
10.1101/035576,"Alpine regions are under increased attention worldwide do their role in storing freshwater of high quality and their high sensitivity to climate change - comparable only to the poles. Riparian ecosystems in such regions, integrating water and nutrient fluxes from aquatic and terrestrial environments, host a disproportionally rich biodiversity, despite experiencing severe climate and nutrient restrictions. With climate change rapidly encroaching in the alpine biome, it is important to fully understand how the lake and its surrounding landscape elements sustain such rich ecosystems, before their functional connectivity could be seriously severed.\n\nA total of 189 glacial origin lakes in the Central Pyrenees were surveyed to test how key elements of lake and terrestrial environments work together at different scales to shape the riparian plant composition. Secondly, we evaluated how these ecotope features drive the formation of riparian communities potentially sensitive to environmental change, and assessed their habitat distribution. At each lake plant taxonomic composition was assessed together with elemental composition of water and sediment and ecosystem-relevant geographical factors.\n\nAt macroscale vegetation composition responded to pan-climatic gradients altitude and latitude, which captured, in a narrow geographic area the transition between large European climatic zones. Hydrodynamics was the main catchment-scale factor connecting riparian vegetation with large-scale water fluxes, followed by topography and geomorphology. Lake sediment Mg and Pb, and water Mn and Fe contents reflected local connections with nutrient availability, and water saturation of the substrate.\n\nCommunity analysis identified four keystone plant communities of large niche breadths, present in a wide range of habitats, from (i) damp environments, (ii) snow bed-silicate bedrock, (iii) wet heath, and (iv) limestone bedrock. With environmental change advancing in the alpine biome, this study provides critical information on fundamental linkages between riparian ecosystem and surrounding landscape elements, which could prove invaluable in assessing future biomic impacts.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/035576_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 6\"">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f7ed3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f8c49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a3493dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d5a2c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstractRiparian ecosystem of Lake Cardal (0.3ha, 2224m a.s.l) in the Pyrenees National Park (France), with a network diagram of connected landscape elements.

10.1101/035626,"Genomic variation across cancers scales with tissue stiffness: meta-analyses show tumors in stiff tissues such as lung and bone exhibit up to 100-fold more variation than tumors in soft tissues such as marrow and brain. Here, nuclear lamina damage and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) result from invasive migration of cancer cells through stiff constrictions. DSBs increase with lamin-A knockdown and require micro-pores sufficiently small for lamins to impede migration. Blebs in the vast majority of post-migration nuclei are enriched in lamin-A but deficient in lamin-B and an age-associated form of lamin-A. Validation of DSBs by an electrophoretic comet assay calibrates against a cancer line having nuclease sites engineered in chromosome-1, and DSB-bound repair factors in nuclei pulled into constrictions show folded chromatin orients, extends, and concentrates without fragmentation. Mobile repair proteins simultaneously segregate away from pore-condensed chromatin. Global squeeze-out of repair factors and loss with lamin-A-dependent rupture explains why overexpression of repair factors cannot rescue DSBs in migration through stiff constrictions, ultimately favoring genomic variation."

10.1101/035642,"Characterizing transcriptomes in both model and non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. Each step may be accomplished in one of several different ways, using different software packages, each producing different results. This analytical complexity begs the question - Which method(s) are optimal? Using reference and non-reference based evaluative methods, I propose a set of guidelines that aim to standardize and facilitate the process of transcriptome assembly. These recommendations include the generation of between 20 million and 40 million sequencing reads from single individual where possible, error correction of reads, gentle quality trimming, assembly filtering using Transrate and/or gene expression, annotation using dammit, and appropriate reporting. These recommendations have been extensively benchmarked and applied to publicly available transcriptomes, resulting in improvements in both content and contiguity. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed standardized methods, I have released a set of version controlled open-sourced code, The Oyster River Protocol for Transcriptome Assembly, available at http://oyster-river-protocol.rtfd.org/."
10.1101/035675,"Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate is one of the most commonly used error rates for measuring and controlling rates of false discoveries when performing multiple tests. Adaptive false discovery rates rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in false discovery rate estimator. Our case study concerns a genome-wise association meta-analysis which considers associations with body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates.

10.1101/035683,"Background: Modern clinical trials in stroke reperfusion fall into two categories: alternative systemic pharmacological regimens to alteplase and \""rescue\"" endovascular approaches using targeted thrombectomy devices and/or medications delivered directly for persistently vessel occlusions. Clinical trials in stroke have not evaluated how initial pharmacological thrombolytic management might influence subsequent rescue strategy. A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a novel trial design that can test these dynamic treatment regimens and lead to treatment guidelines which more closely mimic practice.\n\nAim: To characterize a SMART design in comparison to traditional approaches for stroke reperfusion trials.\n\nMethods: We conducted a numerical simulation study that evaluated the performance of contrasting acute stroke clinical trial designs of both initial reperfusion and rescue therapy. We compare a SMART design where the same patients are followed through initial reperfusion and rescue therapy within one trial to a standard phase III design comparing two reperfusion treatments and a separate phase II futility design of rescue therapy in terms of sample size, power, and ability to address particular research questions.\n\nResults: Traditional trial designs can be well powered and have optimal design characteristics for independent treatment effects. When treatments, such as the reperfusion and rescue therapies, may interact, commonly used designs fail to detect this. A SMART design, with similar sample size to standard designs, can detect treatment interactions.\n\nConclusions: The use of SMART designs to investigate effective and realistic dynamic treatment regimens is a promising way to accelerate the discovery of new, effective treatments for stroke."
10.1101/035741,"Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is emerging as a powerful monitoring tool in cancer, pregnancy and organ transplantation. Nucleosomal DNA, the predominant form of cfDNA in blood, can be readily adapted for sequencing via ligation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) adapters. dsDNA library preparation, however, is insensitive to ultrashort, degraded and single-stranded cfDNA. Drawing inspiration from recent technical advances in ancient genome analyses, we have applied a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation method to sequencing of cfDNA in the plasma of lung transplant recipients (40 samples, six patients). We found that the ssDNA library preparation yields a greater portion of sub-100 bp DNA, as well as an increased relative abundance of human mitochondrial cfDNA (10.7x) and microbial cfDNA (71.3x). We report the fragmentation pattern of mitochondrial, nuclear genomic and microbial cfDNA over a broad fragment length range. We furthermore report the first observation of donor-specific mitochondrial cfDNA in the circulation of lung transplant recipients. We found that donor-specific mitochondrial cfDNA molecules are significantly shorter than those specific to the recipient. The higher yield of viral, microbial and fungal sequences that result from the single-stranded ligation approach reduces the cost and increase the sensitivity of cfDNA-based monitoring for infectious complications after transplantation. An ssDNA library preparation method provides a more informative window into understudied forms of cfDNA, including mitochondrial and microbial derived cfDNA and short fragment nuclear genomic cfDNA, while retaining information provided by standard dsDNA library preparation methods."
