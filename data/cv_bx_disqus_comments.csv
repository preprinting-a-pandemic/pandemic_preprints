We saw Wuhan on December 30th go through a low friction few days for big spread.  Twice again in January.  With a 10-14 day incubation period (spitballing), the events combined were resonant and hence the beginning of the epidemic.  We see more to come.  We can only see 3-5 days ahead.  The problem with knowing this is the problem of the invisibility of infection. Countdown 10-14 days to knowing how things went.  Right now we expect events from last week to see large upticks of cases in early February.</p><p>Not pretending to know much about this new coronovirus but the events that drove Wuhan are different than SARS2003. That SARS2003 blew up in and around South China gave it friction for spreading. I have all the indoor humidity data from 2003, most cities in the world.  You'll see Toronto with very little friction, Hong Kong in March with three periods of low friction (high spread).  You'll see the ease of spread at Amoy area (sewerage leak) and the days where the ease of spread at Prince of Wales led to two big waves in the hospital to visitors and health care workers.</p><p>We automated the marvelous work that Singapore did with SARS in 2003.  They shut it down faster than any other country.  They did it at borders, schools and hospitals.  Turned out that except for one case, all the cases came from non-patients at hospitals.</p><p>This is a standard of care in some hospitals in the US.

Some attempt to infer the potential host range or evolutionary history from the genome. Here Ramaiah and Arumugaswami suggest that a 39nt insertion in the 2019-nCoV genome bears similarity to the fish genomic sequence of Myripristis murdjan. BLASTn analysis of this 39nt insert reveals that 31nt of that 39nt (TTGAAGGTTTTAATTGTTACTTTCCTTTACA) has 90.2% similarity to the region 11671777-11671807 of  Myripristis murdjan genome, chromosome: 21 (LR597570.1) TTGAAGGTTTTACTTGTTATTTTCCTTGACA.</p><p>While it looks very much like these two nucleotide strings have high 'Identity', in terms of pairwise alignment, it does not imply that there is a meaningful or ancestral link between the two sequences. In fact the expected value (E-Value) of this alignment is 0.24 which has been omitted from the paper. If you keep in mind that the BLAST E-value is the number of expected hits of similar score that could be found just by chance. Given the entire non-redundant database size the alignment between nCov-2019 and Myripristis murdjan has a score of 43.7. Therefore we expect find 0.24 hits based on chance alone given this score and this size of library.</p><p>The authors suggest that ""This observation suggests an interesting hypothesis that a marine CoV affecting fish could be a possible source for the virus recombination and evolution.""

"15410";"4792950097";;"Zhen Peng";"<p>I think it is HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE to rename 2019-nCoV as SARS-CoV-2. The disease, which was recently named by the Chinese health officials as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), is very different from SARS in multiple ways, and the virus 2019-nCoV itself is also more distant to SARS-CoV than to its known closest relative which is a bat coronavius Bat CoV RaTG13. <br>First, according to <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.02.06.20020974v1%3AoBc6SWRpzmgPa8Kqr-tD6M7NRv4&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974v1"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a>, the symptoms of NCP differ from those of SARS in multiple ways, among which the most notable one is that ""fever occurred in only 43.8% of patients on initial presentation and developed in 87.9% following hospitalization"", while a characteristic feature of SARS patient is the fast development of fever and ""absence of fever in 2019-nCoV ARD is more frequent than in SARS-CoV (1%)"". Besides, NCP, although having ""pneumonia"" in its name, can actually have some symptoms that does not seem like pneumonia. For example, radiologic test at presentation shows that ""of 840 patients who underwent chest computed tomography on admission, 76.4% manifested as pneumonia"", which means that more than 20% of the patients did not develop pneumonia at presentation. Some patients, although few, even developed symptoms in their digestive systems before having fever or cough. Such properties make it difficult for diagnosing NCP, and actually there have been a debate among Chinese health workers recently about the criteria for diagnosis, which even resulted in different criteria in Hubei province and other parts of China. On the other hand, although SARS is much more severe and harder to cure than NCP, it is not this hard to diagnose SARS, because SARS patients almost always develop fever or lower respiratory symptoms really fast (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsars%2Fclinical%2Fguidance.html%29%3AWT2ax_6dOkb4uRaOhZZlr_XZgWY&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/guidance.html)"">https://www.cdc.gov/sars/cl...</a>. <br>Second, because patients infected with 2019-nCoV do not usually develop fever shortly after the infection or onset, the ""fever-checking"" strategy of identifying potential sources of infection, which was proven to be very effective against SARS, becomes not that reliable against NCP. Therefore, the Chinese government and Chinese people have to adopt more extreme methods to control the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as highly strict transportation restrictions. Therefore, the strategy of disease control over 2019-nCoV/NCP is very different from that of SARS-CoV/SARS. <br>Third, according to <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biorxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.01.22.914952v2%3ACWcfg_iPzYtYABql_6odh4yGKIM&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.914952v2"">https://www.biorxiv.org/con...</a>, 2019-nCoV is very similar to a bat coronavirus Bat CoV RaTG13 (96% identical), while 2019-nCoV ""shared 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV BJ01"". Therefore, renaming 2019-nCoV as ""SARS-CoV-2"" could be misleading, as naive students, researchers, or the public may mistakenly suppose that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are more similar to each other than to any other virus. Indeed, it had already been really hard for me to explain the differences between ""SARS"", ""SARS-like"" and ""SARS-related"" to my friends, families, and even some colleagues who are not familiar with phylogenetic analysis, and I expect that it would be even harder to explain to them how different ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""SARS-CoV"" are. <br>Fourth, although different researchers and officials have suggested different names for the disease, the name ""2019-nCoV"", since its first proposal by WHO, have been widely used by academia, news media, and governmental documents. Perhaps this is one of the few consensuses people have reached about this novel pathogen/disease so far. ""2019-nCoV"" is not a wrong name, and it does not cause misinterpretations, and it does not hinder our understanding of and fight against this novel pathogen/disease. Therefore, there is NO NEED to introduce a new, potentially misleading name for the same thing. I see no reason for rejecting ""first come, first served"". <br>To summarize, considering clinical practice, disease control strategy, phylogenetic analysis, and what have already happened in the real world (rather than a conceptual/theoretical/computational arena) concerning 2019-nCoV, it is highly inappropriate and potentially misleading to rename the pathogen as ""SARS-CoV-2"". If some researchers do strongly think that it is necessary to include the four letters S-A-R-S in the name, I suggest they use ""SARS-like"" or ""SARS-related"" rather than a naked ""SARS"".</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.07.937862";"2020-02-12";"06:47:21";"2020-02-12T06:47:21";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862v1";"937862"

Therefore, the difference among individuals should be assessed by bulk transcriptome data. Indeed, the average UMI per cell regardless of the cell types is much higher in the Asian male Donor2 than others when the scRNA-seq data of Reyfman et al. were reanalyzed. Based on this observation, I checked bulk ACE2 expression levels in GTEx. Among 515 genotyped individuals (so we can impute the ethnicity) with lung RNA-seq data, there are eight and 436 putative Asians and Caucasians, respectively (imputed from the first two principal components [<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fgtex_analysis_v8%2Fsingle_tissue_qtl_data%2FGTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL_covariates.tar.gz%3ANV-sYGhZOU_MiXqUNhVfKWnsQ2o&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/single_tissue_qtl_data/GTEx_Analysis_v8_eQTL_covariates.tar.gz"">https://storage.googleapis....</a>] and V8 donor [<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgtexportal.org%2Fhome%2FtissueSummaryPage%3A8ESsubC29Dm4GxTs0C4Vq1FvHq8&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://gtexportal.org/home/tissueSummaryPage"">https://gtexportal.org/home...</a>]).</p><p>The result of comparison is shown below and in the figure; in my analysis I did not see significant difference between Asians and Caucasian in the ACE2 expression levels (P by two-tailed t-test = 0.858, P by generalized linear model [GLM] considering sex, age and type of death as covariates = 0.999). Also there was no difference between males (N = 300) and females (N = 144) (P by two-tailed t-test = 0.388, P by GLM = 0.172). When the above described covariates were considered, age as an ordinal variable (10-year bins) was positively associated with ACE2 expression (P by GLM = 0.00335). Lastly, we note that a highly significant difference was observed between individuals on a ventilator immediately before death and the others (P by two-tailed t-test = 6.26e-08, P by GLM = 9.3e-10).</p><p>Therefore, we can say as follows.<br>1)	Given a much larger sample size in the above analysis, likely there is no big difference in ACE2 expression between males and females (at least in Caucasians).<br>2)	While the sample size is still small, there is no evidence supporting an ACE2 expression difference between Asians and Caucasians in the GTEx data.<br>3)	Use of a ventilator immediately before death is significantly correlated with up-regulation of ACE2 expression.</p><p>The following is the original result of a GLM analysis<br>                                      Estimate Std.

Primary infection: In the first phase SARS-Cov-2infects cells through the furin protein, thanks to its spike protein cleavage. This would account for its relatively high infection rate and initially mild symptoms. It could also explain why asymptomatic patients shed the virus.</p><p>2.  Secondary infection: In a second phase, once in the body, the SARS-Cov-2 virus would infect cells through the traditional 2003 SARS route, namely the ACE2 receptors in lower lung cells, which would result in pneumonia and acute 2003 SARS-like symptoms.</p><p>I would greatly appreciate feedback on this hypothesis<br>from virologists and other researchers reading this thread.</p><p>P.S.

"15888";"4820098122";"disqus_L7DYHJ4gtL";"Katrina";"<p>Review of paper “Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China” by Liu et al. from computational biology journal club at UTK:</p><p>Summary: The authors compare the 2019-nCov and SARS coronavirus outbreaks based on reproductive number and time period of onset of symptoms to isolation using exponential Growth, maximum likelihood estimation and time-dependent reproduction models. Their goal is to understand human to human transmission dynamics (reproductive number), incubation period, and time period of onset of symptoms to isolation of the 2019-nCov virus.<br>The authors conclude that 2019-nCoV is more transmissible based on average reproductive number and doubling time. They state that the doubling time was much lower (2.4 vs. 12.4) in the 2019-nCoV vs. SARS. As well as the reproductive number estimated by exponential growth, ML and time dependent reproduction number is lower for SARS. The authors research is novel since currently there are no published research on time-varying instantaneous reproduction number.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1.	In the Methods section, on page 6, the authors use Poisson regression to model the basic reproduction number (R0), exponential growth to model the growth rate of population, and gamma distribution for modeling the generation time. Please justify the distribution used and how viral super-spreaders, where few infected individuals are responsible for infecting the majority of individuals could impact the model selections. How could the selection of Poisson distribution impact the estimation of parameters? Does the answer from R0 depend on the distribution chosen?</p><p>2.	The confidence intervals for R0 in Table 1 for SARS and NCP cases at nationwide scale are large enough that the R0 overlap for SARS and NCP. The conclusion stating that the SARS R0 is higher than NCP may be overstated since it depends on the scale (nationwide vs. individual cities) when the R0  is indeed higher in SARS vs. NCP only at city wide scale where confidence intervals do not overlap for R0.</p><p>3.	For supplemental figure S3, the generation time was only varied by 7 to 9. How is R0 affected with generations time outside the range of 7 to 9? Please provide rationale for small range of generation time effect. Please provide a rationale for why generation time was not varied for modeling Rt as done for R0 in supplemental Figure S3.</p><p>4.	In the methods section, under sensitivity analysis header (page 7 and 8), the assumptions for the R0 and Rt model used in the R package should be further explained. Does the model assume constant population size, constant transmission rate, no births and deaths, and well-mixed population or homogenous population..etc. ? What are the limitations of the model and if the assumptions are not met, when will the model over estimate or under estimate R0 and Rt ?</p><p>5.	In the methods section under the data collection header, the data used for SARS and NCP are different in relation to the epidemic time scale. The models used to predict R0 and Rt for SARS are using data for one year (2002-2003) and NCP (data as of February 7,2020). How could the selection of distribution for generation time, growth rate and R0 and Rt values be impacted by using early epidemic data vs. entire epidemic data?</p><p>6.	The authors used the generation time from previous paper of mean generation time of 7.5 days. While the authors did change the generation time from 7.5 to 9.5 days which resulted in R0 &gt; 1 (Figure S3), it is not clear the impact of the generation time on R0 outside the range of 7.5 and 9.5.</p><p>7.	The same comparison of SARS on the days from symptom to onset (figure 2) was not provided. As well as what was the average incubation period of SARs so one can compare to 2019-nCoV. If this analysis is not possible, please provide reasoning and how this can impact results of comparison between SARS and 2019-nCoV.</p><p>8.	For figure 2, it would be informative if there were some statistics performed between the number of cases in Wuhang vs. Guangdong.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>9.	It would be beneficial to provide line numbers for reviewers.</p><p>10.	The map (Figure 1) is not legible in black and white. This may be a concern for readers who cannot print in color.</p><p>11.	For figure 3, please provide confidence intervals or explain the pink shaded area and the dotted line in figure legend and text.</p><p>12.	In Methods section on sensitivity analysis, please provide the number of the iterations used to estimate reproductive number.</p><p>13.	The figure legends lack description and would be more beneficial to readers if they explained what the figure is result of (method used to generate data/results). (ex. For Figure 2, Temporal distribution of confirmed NCP cases nationwide from Bayesian nowcasting model).</p><p>14.	It would be beneficial to future researchers to publish supplementary data of the incidence data used for the modeling the reproduction numbers.</p><p>15.	For figure 2, it is not clear if data was not available for all dates, dates were skipped, no NCP cases reported (i.e. Dec 30,2019). Please provide this information and or note why dates were skipped for analyses. As well plotting 0 if that is the situation that no NCP cases were reported.</p><p>16.	For the sensitivity analysis, please provide more details in the methods section or supplemental section for how analysis were performed.</p>";"10.1101/2020.01.25.919787";"2020-03-04";"11:45:06";"2020-03-04T11:45:06";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.919787v2";"919787"

ACE2 transcript does not necessarily translate to viral permissiveness in kidney/bladder epithelia or cytokine release.  <br>- This study focuses on only healthy tissue; it will be useful to analyze kidney/bladder epithelial ACE2 expression under inflammatory conditions or in patients with underlying kidney conditions.  <br>- Given what is known about protease TMPRSS2 expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2+TMPRSS2+ double-positive cell identification would be useful in these datasets.</p><p><u>Importance/Relevance:</u></p><p>- ACE2 protein is spatially restricted to brush border of proximal tubules and in bladder umbrella cells [1], such cells in direct contact with viral particles are likely to be highly sensitive to viral-induced damage.  <br>- SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to be detected in urine of patients and associate with higher mortality [2,3], thus worth understanding kidney damage and resultant immune response in SARS-CoV-2 as well.   <br>- This study argues for a potential mode of viral infectivity and resultant inflammatory responses in these tissue in addition to reported infectivity in the lung and digestive system, which is supported by clinical data showing acute and early kidney complications in 2019-nCoV patients (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1101%2F2020.02.08.20021212%29%3AobICp9g7xJdIodY63GexkHQmj5U&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212)"">https://doi.org/10.1101/202...</a> <br>- Clinically, thus very important to track urinary CoVID-19 shedding as well as study acute kidney injury-related co-morbidities.</p><p><u>References:</u></p><p>1.

They identified 332 viral-host protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, they used these interactions to identify 66 existing drugs known to target host proteins or host pathways (eg SARS-CoV-2 N and Orf8 proteins interact with proteins regulated by the mTOR pathway, so mTOR inhibitors Silmitasertib and Rapamycin are possible drug candidates).</p><p>Limitations: The main limitation of the study stems from the reductionist model: overexpression of plasmids encoding individual viral proteins in HEK293T cells. This precludes any interactions between the viral proteins, or the combined effects of multiple proteins on the host, as they are expressed individually. Moreover, HEK293T cells come from primary embryonic kidney and therefore might not reflect how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its primary target, the lung. However, the authors found that the proteins found to interact with viral proteins in their experiments are enriched in lung tissue compared to HEK293Ts.</p><p>Significance: The authors provide a “SARS-CoV-2 interaction map,” which may provide potential hypotheses as to how the virus interacts with the host. Further, they identified existing drugs that could disrupt these host-viral interactions and curb SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"16323";"4846240673";"sinaiimmunologyreviewproject";"Sinai Immunol Review Project";"<p><u>Main findings</u><br>The authors highlight a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), as a potential receptor used by the current Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a host factor that allows the virus target human cells. This virus-host interaction facilitates the infection of human cells with a high affinity comparable with SARS-CoV. The authors propose this mechanism as a probable explanation of the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans. Besides, Walls and colleagues described SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein S by Cryo-EM along with neutralizing polyclonal response against SAR-CoV-2 S from mice immunized with SAR-CoV and blocking SAR-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into VeroE6 infected cells.</p><p><u>Limitations of the study</u><br>The SARS-CoV-2 depends on the cell factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2, this last, according to a recent manuscript by Markus Hoffman et al., Cell, 2020. The authors used green monkey (VeroE6) and hamster (BHK) cell lines in the experiments to drive its conclusions to humans; however, it is well known the caucasian colon adenocarcinoma human cell line (CaCo-2), highly express the hACE2 receptor as the TMPRSS2 protease as well. In humans, ACE2 protein is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, which again, makes the CaCo-2 cell line suitable for the following SARS-CoV-2 studies.</p><p><u>Relevance</u><br>The results propose a functional receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect humans worldwide and defining two distinct conformations of spike (S) glycoprotein by cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). This study might help establish a precedent for initial drug design and treatment of the current global human coronavirus epidemic.</p><p><u>References</u><br>1. Hoffman M. et al.

Bioinformatic analyses predict multiple conserved CD8+ T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 NP, suggesting that a similar approach may be feasible for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>The authors focus on a site within a 20-peptide region of EBOV NP which was commonly targeted by CD8+ T cells in a group of EBOV survivors carrying the HLA-A*30:01:01 allele. To justify the testing of specific vaccine epitopes in a mouse challenge setting, the authors cite known examples of human pathogen-derived peptide antigens that are also recognized by C57BL/6 mice, as well as existing data surrounding known mouse immunogenicity of peptides related to this EBOV NP region. Testing 3 distinct 9mer peptides over an 11 amino-acid window and comparing to vaccination with the 11mer with a T-cell reactivity readout demonstrated that optimizing peptide length and position for immunogenicity may be crucial, likely due to suboptimal peptide processing and MHC-class-I loading.</p><p>Vaccines for maEBOV challenge studies were constructed by packaging NP44-52 in d,l poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid microspheres. CpG was also packaged within the microspheres, while Monophosphoryl Lipid A (a TLR4 ligand) was added to the injectate solution. A second peptide consisting of a predicted MHC-II epitope from the EBOV VG19 protein was added using a separate population of microspheres, and the formulation was injected by intraperitoneal administration. The vaccine was protective against a range of maEBOV doses up to at least 10,000 PFU. Survival was anticorrelated with levels of IL6, MCP-1 (CCL2), IL9, and GM-CSF, which recapitulated trends seen in human EBOV infection.</p><p>While HLA-A*30:01:01 is only present in a minority of humans, the authors state that MHC binding algorithms predict NP44-52 to be a strong binder of a set of more common HLA-A*02 alleles. The authors predict that a peptide vaccine based on the proposed formulation could elicit responses in up to 50% of people in Sudan or 30% of people in North America. <br>SARS-CoV-2 NP, meanwhile, has conserved regions which may provide peptide-vaccine candidates. Scanning the SARS-CoV-2 NP sequence for HLA-binding 9mers identified 53 peptides with predicted binding affinity &lt; 500nM, including peptides that are predicted to bind to HLA-class-I alleles of 97% of humans, 7 of which have previously been tested in-vitro.</p><p>The results support previously appreciated correlations between certain cytokines and disease severity, specifically IL6 which relates to multiple trial therapies. Prediction of HLA-class-I binding of SARS-CoV-2 NP peptides suggests the plausibility of a peptide vaccine targeting conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 NP although further validation in previously infected patient samples will be essential.</p><p>Review by Andrew M.

While SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have over 70 % sequence homology and share the same human receptor ACE2, the receptor binding motif (RBM) is only 50% homologous.<br>Computational prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interactions based on the previous crystal structure data of SARS-CoV, and measurement of binding affinities against human ACE2 using recombinant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S1 peptides, demonstrated similar binding of the two S1 peptides to ACE2, explaining the similar transmissibility of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and consistent with previous data (Wall et al Cell 2020).<br>The neutralization activity of SARS-CoV-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies were about two-order of magnitude less efficient to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV, and four potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV had poor binding and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, 3 poor SARS-CoV-binding monoclonal antibodies show some efficiency to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that that antibodies to more conserved regions outside the RBM motif might possess better cross-protective neutralizing activities between two strains.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study: </u><br>It would have been helpful to show the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies tested on both SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 to be able to make predictions for induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies. The data on monoclonal antibody competition with ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV RBD should have also included binding on SARS-CoV2, especially for the three monoclonal antibodies that showed neutralization activity for SARS-CoV2. Because of the less homology in RBM sequences between viruses, it still may be possible that these antibodies would recognize the ACE2 RBD in SARS-CoV-2.<br><u>The importance and implications for the current epidemics:</u><br>It is noteworthy that immunization to mice and rabbit with SARS-CoV S1 or RBD protein could induce monoclonal antibodies to cross-bind and cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 even if they are not ACE2-blocking. If these types of antibodies could be found in human survivors or in the asymptomatic populations as well, it might suggest that exposure to previous Coronavirus strains could have induced cross-neutralizing antibodies and resulted in the protection from severe symptoms in some cases of SARS-CoV2.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.16.951723";"2020-03-28";"20:13:13";"2020-03-28T20:13:13";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951723v1";"951723"

Four Chinese rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS-CoV-2 and two out of the four were re-infected at 28 days post initial infection (dpi) with the same viral dose after confirming the recovery by the absence of clinical symptoms, radiological abnormalities and viral detection (2 negative RT-PCR tests). While the initial infection led the viral loads in nasal and pharyngeal swabs that reach approximately 6.5 log10 RNA copies/ml at 3 dpi in all four monkeys, viral loads in the swabs tested negative after reinfection in the two reinfected monkeys. In addition, the necropsies from a monkey (M1) at 7 days after primary infection, and another monkey (M3) at 5 days post reinfection, revealed the histopathological damages and viral replication in the examined tissues from M1, while no viral replication as well as no histological damages were detected in the tissues from M3. Furthermore, sera from three monkeys at 21 and 28 dpi exhibited neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting the production of protective neutralizing antibodies in these monkeys. Overall, this study indicates that primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 may protect from subsequent exposure to the same virus.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study: </u><br>In human, virus has been detected by nasopharyngeal swabs until 9 to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. In the infected monkeys in this study, virus were detected from day 1 after the infection, declining to undetectable level by day 15 post infection. It may suggest that there is a faster viral clearance mechanism in monkeys, therefore the conclusions of reinfection protection for humans need to be carefully considered. In addition, only two monkeys were re-infected in this study and the clinical signs of these monkeys were not similar: M3 did not show weight loss and M4 showed relatively higher fever on the day of infection and the day of re-challenge.  <br><u>The importance and implications for the current epidemics:</u><br>This study showed clear viral clearance and no indications of relapse or viremia after a secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a Chinese rhesus macaque model. These results support the idea that patients with full recovery (two negative RT-PCR results) may also be protected from secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recovered patients may be able to reintegrate to normal public life and provide protective serum perhaps even if having had a mild infection.

To identify B cell epitopes, they assessed structural accessibility, hydrophilicity, and beta-turn and flexibility which are all factors that promote their targeting by antibodies. To identify T cell epitopes, they filtered for peptides with high antigenicity score and capacity to bind 3 or more MHC alleles. Using the protein digest server, they also demonstrated that their identified T and B cell epitopes are stable, having multiple non-digesting enzymes per epitope. Epitopes were also determined to be non-allergenic and non-toxin as assessed by Allergen FP 1.0 and ToxinPred, respectively. For T cell epitopes, they assessed the strength of epitope-HLA interaction via PepSite. Overall, they predict four B cell and eleven T cell epitopes (two MHC I and nine MHC II binding) to pass stringent computational thresholds as candidates for vaccine development. Furthermore, they performed sequence alignment between all identified SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutations and predicted epitopes, and showed that the epitopes are conserved across 134 isolates from 38 locations worldwide. However, they report that these conserved epitopes may soon become obsolete given the known mutation rate of related SARS-CoV is estimated to be 4x10-4/site/year, underscoring the urgency of anti-viral vaccine development.</p><p><b>Limitations of the Study:</b> While spike (S) protein may have a critical role in viral entry into host cells and their epitope prediction criterion were comprehensive, this study did not examine other candidate SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

(2020) propose that neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent SARS-CoV patients may offer insight into cross-reactive antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2. In particular, they find that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein shares 86% sequence similarity with the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein that binds to the CR3022 neutralizing antibody. CR3022 also displays increased affinity for the “up” conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to the “down” conformation as it does for the SARS-CoV S protein. Therefore, the authors propose that this cross-reactive antibody may confer some degree of protection in vivo even if it fails to neutralize in vitro.</p><p>Limitations: Although the authors offer a logical rationale for identifying cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies derived from SARS-CoV, their study using only CR3022 failed to demonstrate whether this approach will be successful. After all, CR3022 failed to neutralize in vitro despite the binding affinity to a similar epitope on SARS-CoV-2.

Corticosteroids were associated with increased mortality for SARS in 2003 and for MERS in 2013, probably due to that fact that systemic corticosteroids suppress the innate immune system, resulting in increased viral replication. However, some steroid compounds might block coronavirus replication. The authors screened steroids from a chemical library and assessed the viral growth suppression and drug cytotoxicity. Ciclesonide demonstrated low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of MERS-CoV viral growth. The commonly used systemic steroids cortisone, prednisolone and dexamethasone did not suppress viral growth, nor did the commonly used inhaled steroid fluticasone. To identify the drug target of virus replication, the authors conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoV passages in the presence of ciclesonide or mometasone, and they could generate a mutant virus that developed resistance to ciclesonide, but not to mometasone. Afterwards, they performed next-generation sequencing and identified an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15) as the predicted mechanism for viral resistance to ciclesonide. The authors were able to successfully generate a recombinant virus carrying that amino acid substitution, which overcome the antiviral effect of ciclesonide, suggesting that ciclosenide interacts with NSP15. The mutant virus was inhibited by mometasone, suggesting that the antiviral target of mometasone is different from that of ciclesonide. Lastly, the effects of ciclesonide and mometason on suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Both compounds were found to suppress viral replication with a similar efficacy to lopinavir.</p><p>Limitations of Analysis:<br>Most of the experiments, including the identification of the mutation in NSP15 were conducted with MERS-CoV. This is not the closest related virus to SARS-CoV-2, as that would be SARS-CoV. Thus, to repeat the initial experiments with SARS-CoV, or preferably SARS-CoV-2, is essential. The manuscript should address this and, therefore, it will require considerable editing for organization and clarity. Also, in terms of cell immunogenic epitopes, while SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains several predicted B and T cell immunogenic epitopes that are shared with other coronaviruses, some studies have shown critical differences between MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. A main criticism is that the authors only used VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells to gauge the direct cytotoxic effects of viral replication. To evaluate this in other cell lines, including human airway epithelial cells, is crucial, as the infectivity of coronavirus strains greatly varies in different cell lines,</p><p>Nevertheless, these findings encourage evaluating ciclesonide and mometasone as better options for patients with COVID-19 in need of inhaled steroids, especially as an alternative to other corticosteroids that have been shown to increase viral replication in vitro.

Four animals were euthanized at 3dpi, the 4 others at 21 dpi.  Study of viral loads in different organs showed that nose swab and throat swabs were the most sensitive, with bronchio-alveolar lavage. Interstitial pneumonia was visible in radiographies and at the histological scale too. Clinically, the macaques had similar symptoms as described in human patients with moderate disease.<br> Viral shedding was consistently detected in nose swabs and throat swabs immediately after infection but less consistent thereafter which could reflect virus administration route (intranasal, oral). Bronchoalveolar lavages performed as a measure of virus replication in the lower respiratory tract on animals maintained for 21 days, contained high viral loads in 1 and 3dpi. The majority of the animals exhibited pulmonary edema and mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia on terminal bronchioles. In addition to the lung, viral RNA could also be detected throughout the respiratory track where viral replication mainly occurred. <br>Immunologic responses included leukocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis and lymphopenia in the majority of the animals at 1dpi. Lymphocytes and monocytes re-normalized at 2dpi. Neutrophils declined after 3dpi and through 10dpi after which they started to recover. After infection, serum analysis revealed significant increases in IL1ra, IL6, IL10, IL15, MCP-1, MIP-1b, but quick normalization (3dpi). Antibody response started around 7dpi, and the antibody titers stayed elevated until 21dpi (day of animal euthanasia).</p><p><b>Critical analysis</b>: The macaques were inoculated via a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes, which might not reproduce how humans get infected.

While these experiments recapitulate moderate COVID-19 in humans, the mode of inoculation via a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, ocular and oral routes, might not reproduce how humans get infected and may lead to different dynamics in the host immune response.

The deleted sequence overlaps a predicted furin cleavage site at the S1 / S2 domain boundary that is present in SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV or the closely related bat coronavirus RaTG13, which are cleaved at S1 / S2 by other proteases [1]. Furin cleavage sites at similar positions in other viruses have been linked to increased pathogenicity and greater cell tropism [2]. Loss of this site in SARS-CoV-2 has also already been shown to increase viral entry into Vero but not BHK cells (which are also interferon deficient) [3]. The authors therefore make an important contribution in demonstrating that passage in Vero cells may lead to spontaneous loss of a key pathogenicity-conferring element in SARS-CoV-2.</p><p><u>Critical analysis<br></u>As the authors note, a similar study posted earlier by Kim et al., which also passaged SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, did not identify any loss in the S protein furin cleavage site [4]. It therefore remains to be determined how likely it is that this mutation spontaneously arises. A quantitative investigation using multiple experimental replicas to understand the spontaneous viral mutation rate at this site and elsewhere would be informative. Also, the mechanistic basis for the higher viral fitness conferred by loss of the furin cleavage site in Vero cells – but, evidently, not in vivo in humans, as this site is maintained in all currently sequenced circulating isolates - remains to be understood.</p><p>Due to the high base-call error rate of MinION sequencing, the authors’ bioinformatic pipeline required aligning transcripts to a reference to correct sequencing artifacts. This presumably made it difficult or impossible to identify other kinds of mutations, such as single nucleotide substitutions, which may occur even more frequently than the deletions identified in this work. Pairing long read sequencing with higher-accuracy short-read sequencing may be one approach to overcome this issue.</p><p><u>Relevance</u><br>As the authors suggest, animal studies using live virus challenge may need to periodically verify the genomic integrity of the virus, or potentially risk unknowingly using a likely less-pathogenic variant of the virus.</p><p>More broadly, the results emphasize the complexity and plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 viral transcriptome and proteome. For example, the authors found multiple versions of transcripts encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein, each with different small internal deletions, some of which were verified for translation by MS. A number of peptides arising from translation of unexpected rearrangements of transcripts were also detected. Additionally, the authors identified phosphorylation of a number of viral proteins (N, M, ORF 3a, nsp3, nsp9, nsp12 and S). For any cases where these have functional consequences, targeting the kinases responsible could be an avenue for drug development. Understanding the functional consequences of the mutations, transcript variations, and post translational modifications identified in this study will be important future work.</p><p>[1] Wrapp, D. et al.

Cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was found to be common, mostly targeting non-RBD regions in plasma from SARS-CoV-2 patients. Only one SARS-CoV-2 plasma sample was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, with low neutralization activity. No cross-neutralization response was detected in plasma from SARS-CoV patients.</p><p>To further investigate the cross-reactivity of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the authors analyzed the antibody response of plasma collected from mice infected or immunized with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV (n = 5 or 6 per group). Plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 displayed cross-reactive responses to SARS-CoV S ectodomain and, to a lesser extent, SARS-CoV RBD. Similarly, plasma from mice immunized with SARS-CoV displayed cross-reactive responses to SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain. Cross-neutralization activity was not detected in any of the mouse plasma samples.</p><p><u>Potential limitations</u><br>The size of each patient cohort is insufficient to accurately determine the frequency of cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Recruitment of additional patients from a larger range of geographical regions and time points would also enable exploration into the effect of the genetic diversity and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on cross-reactivity. This work would also benefit from the mapping of specific epitopes for each sample. Future studies may determine whether the non-neutralizing antibody responses can confer in vitro protection or lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement.</p><p><u>Implications of the findings in the context of current epidemics</u><br>The cross-reactive antibody responses to S protein in the majority of SARS-CoV-2 patients is an important consideration for development of serological assays and vaccine development during the current outbreak. The limited extent of cross-neutralization demonstrated in this study indicates that vaccinating to cross-reactive conserved epitopes may have limited efficacy, presenting a key concern for the development of a more universal coronavirus vaccine to address the global health risk of novel coronavirus outbreaks.</p><p><i>This review was undertaken as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.15.993097";"2020-03-26";"17:38:55";"2020-03-26T17:38:55";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.993097v1";"993097"

"16529";"4848009950";"sinaiimmunologyreviewproject";"Sinai Immunol Review Project";"<p>Summary: <br>The authors propose a novel mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry through the interaction of the viral spike protein (SP) and the immunoglobulin superfamily protein CD147 (also known as Basigin). Using an in-house developed humanized antibody against CD147 (maplazumab), they show that blocking CD147 decreases viral replication in Vero E6 cells. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ELISA, and Co-IP assays, they show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with CD147. Lastly, they utilize immune-election microscopy to show spike protein and CD147 localize to viral inclusion bodies of Vero E6 cells.</p><p>Critical Analysis: <br>The authors claim that an anti-CD147 antibody (Meplazumab) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by testing cell growth and viral load in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, however there are key pieces of this experiment that are missing. First, the authors fail to use a non-specific antibody control. Second, the authors claim that viral replication is inhibited, and that they test this by qPCR, however this data is not shown. To further prove specificity, the authors should introduce CD147 to non-susceptible cells and show that they become permissive. <br>The authors claim that there is a direct interaction between CD147 and SP through SPR, ELISA, and Co-IP, and this data seems generally convincing. The electron microscopy provides further correlative evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may interact with CD147 as they are both found in the same viral inclusion body. A quantification of this data would make the findings more robust. <br>Finally, the data in this paper lacks replicates, error bars, and statistics to show that the data are reproducible and statistically significant.</p><p>Implications:<br>It has been shown in various studies that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cell surface protein ACE2 for cell entry, yet ACE2 is highly expressed in heart, kidney, and intestinal cells, raising the concern that blocking ACE2 would result in harmful side effects. [1] CD147 on the other hand is highly expressed in various tumor types, inflamed tissues, and pathogen infected cells, suggesting that the inhibition of CD147 would not result in major side effects. [2,3] The research in this paper has resulted in an ongoing clinical trial in China to test the safety and efficacy of anti-CD147 Meplazumab to treat COVID-19.

In a series of consecutive in vitro experiments including both stable Ly6E overexpression and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout the authors further demonstrate that Ly6E reduces cellular infection by various other coronaviruses including human SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as murine CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Their experiments suggest that this effect is dependent on Ly6E inhibition of CoV strain-specific spike protein-mediated membrane fusion required for viral cell entry.</p><p>To address the function of Ly6E in vivo, hematopoietic stem cell-specific Ly6E knock-out mice were generated by breeding Ly6Efl/fl mice (referred to as functional wild-type mice) with transgenic Vav-iCre mice (offspring referred to as Ly6E HSC ko mice); wild-type and Ly6E HSC ko mice of both sexes were infected intraperitoneally with varying doses of the natural murine coronavirus MHV, a pathogen that depending on route of infection can cause a wide range of diseases in mice including hepatitis, enteritis and encephalomyelitis. Briefly, compared to wild-type controls, mice lacking hematopoietic cell-expressed Ly6E were found to present with increased mortality, a more severe  disease phenotype as based on serum ALT levels (prognostic of liver damage), liver histopathology,  and viral titers in the spleen. Moreover, bulk RNAseq analysis of infected liver and spleen tissues indicated changes in gene expression pathways related to tissue damage and antiviral immune responses as well as a reduction of genes associated with type I IFN response and inflammation. Finally, the authors report substantial differences in the numbers of hepatic and splenic APC  subsets between wild-type and knockout mice following MHV infection and show that Ly6E-deficient B cells and to a lesser extent also DCs are particularly susceptible to MHV infection in vitro.</p><p>Potential limitations</p><p>Experiments and data in this study are presented in an overall logical and coherent fashion; however, some observations and the conclusions drawn are problematic and should be further addressed &amp; discussed by the authors. Methodological &amp; formal limitations include relatively low replicate numbers as well as missing technical replicates for some in vitro experiments (cf. Fig. legend 1; Fig. legend 2e); the omission of “outliers” in Fig. legend 2 without an apparent rationale as to why this approach was chosen; the lack of detection of actual Ly6E protein levels in Ly6E HSC ko or wild-type mice; and most importantly, missing information on RNAseq data collection &amp; analysis in the method section and throughout the paper. A more relevant concern though is that the interpretation of the experimental data presented and the language used tend to overrate and at times overgeneralize findings: for example, while the authors demonstrate statistically significant, Ly6E-mediated reduction of coronavirus titers in stable cells lines in vitro, it remains unclear whether a viral titer reduction by one log decade would be of actual biological relevance in face of high viral titers in vivo. After high-dose intraperitoneal MHV infection in vivo, early viral titers in Ly6E HSC knockout vs. wt mice showed an elevation in the spleen (~1.5 log decades) but not liver of the ko mice (other tissue not evaluated), and while ko mice presented with only modestly increased liver pathology, both male and female ko mice exhibited significantly higher mortality. Thus, the manuscript title statement that “Ly6E … confers immune control of viral disease” is directly supported by only limited in vivo data, and gain-of-function experiments (eg. Ly6E overexpression) were not performed. Of additional note here, tissue tropism and virulence differ greatly among various MHV strains and isolates whereas dose, route of infection, age, genetic background and sex of the mice used may additionally affect disease outcome and phenotype (cf. Taguchi F &amp; Hirai-Yuki A, <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.3389%2Ffmicb.2012.00068%3B%3A_FP6IOHe-b7ZzvKkWcsrQTtJrqw&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00068;"">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmi...</a> Kanolkhar A et al, <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjvi.asm.org%2Fcontent%2F%3AGJ7h_l2hTo9fQAZeGiZdD9fn6Mg&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://jvi.asm.org/content/"">https://jvi.asm.org/content/</a> 83/18/9258). Observations attributed to hematopoietic stem cell-specific Ly6E deletion could therefore be influenced by the different genetic backgrounds of floxed and cre mice used, and although it appears that littermates wt and ko littermates were used in the experiments, the potentially decisive impact of strain differences should at least have been discussed. Along these lines, it should also be taken into account that the majority of human coronaviruses cause respiratory symptoms, which follow a different clinical course engaging other primary cellular mediators than the hepatotropic murine MHV disease studied here. It therefore remains highly speculative how the findings reported in this study will translate to human disease and it would therefore be important to test other routes of MHV infection and doses that have been described to produce a more comparable phenotype to human coronavirus disease (cf. Kanolkhar A et al, <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjvi.asm.org%2Fcontent%2F%3AGJ7h_l2hTo9fQAZeGiZdD9fn6Mg&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://jvi.asm.org/content/"">https://jvi.asm.org/content/</a> 83/18/9258). Another important shortcoming of this study is the lack of any information on functional deficits or changes in Ly6E-deficient immune cells and how this might relate to the phenotype observed. Overall, the in vitro experiments are more convincing than the in vivo studies which appear somewhat limited.</p><p>Overall relevance for the field</p><p>Despite some shortcomings, the experiments performed in this study suggest a novel and somewhat unexpected role of Ly6E in the protection against coronaviruses across species. These findings are of relevance and should be further explored in ongoing research on potential coronavirus therapies. Yet an important caveat pertains to the authors’ suggestion that “therapeutic mimicking of Ly6E action” may constitute a first line of defense against novel coronaviruses since their own prior work demonstrated that Ly6E can enhance rather than curtail infection with influenza A and other viruses.</p><p>Reviewed as part of a project by students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.05.979260";"2020-03-25";"22:31:23";"2020-03-25T22:31:23";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.979260v1";"979260"

They identify 405 viral epitopes that are presentable on MHC-I and MHC-II and validate using known epitopes from SARS-CoV. To determine whether immune surveillance drives viral mutations to evade MHC presentation, the authors analyzed 68 viral genomes from 4 continents. They identified 93 point mutations that occurred preferentially in regions predicted to be presented by MHC-I (p=0.02) suggesting viral evolution to evade CD8 T-cell mediated killing. 2 nonsense mutations were also identified that resulted in loss of presentation of an associated antigen (FGDSVEEVL) predicted to be good antigen for presentation across multiple HLA alleles. <br>To identify potential sites of neutralizing antibody binding, the authors used homology modeling to the SARS-CoV’s spike protein (S protein) to determine the putative structure of the CoV2 spike protein. They used Discotope2 to identify antibody binding sites on the protein surface in both the down and up conformations of the S protein. The authors validate this approach by first identifying antibody binding site in SARS-CoV S protein. In both the down and up conformation of the CoV2 S protein, the authors identified a potential antibody binding site on the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the ACE2 receptor (residues 440-460, 494-506). While RBDs in both SARS-CoV and CoV2 spike proteins may be important for antibody binding, the authors note that SARS-CoV has larger attack surfaces than CoV2. These results were later validated on published crystal structures of the CoV2 S protein RBD and human ACE2. Furthermore, analysis of 68 viral genomes did not identify any mutations in this potential antibody binding site in CoV2. <br>Finally, the authors compile a list of potential peptide vaccine candidates across the viral genome that can be presented by multiple HLA alleles. Several of the peptides showed homology to SARS-CoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes.</p><p>Limitations: While the authors used computational methods of validation, primarily through multiple comparisons to published SARS-CoV structures and epitopes, future work should include experimental validation of putative T-cell and B-cell epitopes.</p><p>Importance: The authors identified potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes that may be good candidates for peptide based vaccines against CoV2. They also made interesting observations in comparing SARS-CoV and CoV2 potential antibody binding sites, noting that SARS-CoV had larger attack surfaces for potential neutralizing antibody binding. One of the highlights of this paper was the authors’ mutation analysis of 68 viral genomes from 4 continents. This analysis not only validated their computational method for identifying T-cell epitopes, but showed that immune surveillance likely drives viral mutation in MHC-I binding peptides. The smaller attack surface may point to potential mechanisms of immune evasion by CoV2. However, absence of mutations in the RBD of CoV2 and the small number of mutations in peptides presentable to T cells suggests that vaccines against multiple epitopes could still elicit robust immunity against CoV2.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.19.955484";"2020-03-25";"17:02:59";"2020-03-25T17:02:59";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.955484v1";"955484"

Peripheral blood was collected from hospitalized ICU (n=12) and non-ICU (n=21) patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV and from healthy controls (n=10) in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology China (Hefei, Anhui). Immune analysis was conducted by flow cytometry. 2019-nCoV patients had decreased lymphocyte, monocyte, and CD4 T cell counts compared to healthy controls. ICU patients had fewer lymphocytes than non-ICU patients. CD4 T cells of 2019-nCoV patients expressed higher levels of activation markers (OX40, CD69, CD38, CD44) and exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim3) than those of healthy controls. CD4 cells of ICU patients expressed significantly higher levels of OX40, PD-1, and Tim3 than those of non-ICU patients. 2019-nCoV patients had higher percentages of CD4 T cells co-expressing GM-CSF and IL-6 compared to healthy controls, while ICU patients had a markedly higher percentage of GM-CSF+ IFN-γ+ CD4 T cells than non-ICU patients. The CD4 T cells of nCoV patients and healthy controls showed no differences in TNF-α secretion.</p><p>The CD8 T cells of 2019-nCoV patients also showed higher expression of activation markers CD69, CD38, and CD44, as well as exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim3, compared to healthy controls. CD8 T cells of ICU patients expressed higher levels of GM-CSF than those of non-ICU patients and healthy controls. No IL-6 or TNF-α was found in the CD8 T cells of any group. There were no differences in numbers of NK cells or B cells in 2019-nCoV patients and healthy controls, nor was there any GM-CSF or IL-6 secretion from these cells in either group.</p><p>Percentages of CD14+ CD16+ GM-CSF+ and CD14+ CD16+ IL-6+ inflammatory monocytes were significantly increased in nCoV patients compared to healthy controls; in particular, patients in the ICU had greater percentages of CD14+ CD16+ IL-6+ monocytes than non-ICU patients. The authors suggest that in 2019-nCoV patients, pathogenic Th1 cells produce GM-CSF, recruiting CD14+ CD16+ inflammatory monocytes that secrete high levels of IL-6. These may enter pulmonary circulation and damage lung tissue while initiating the cytokine storm that causes mortality in severe cases. This is consistent with the cytokine storm seen in similar coronaviruses, as IL-6, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF are key inflammatory mediators seen in patients with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.</p><p><b>Limitations of the study: </b>Though the results of this study open questions for further investigation, this is an early study on a small cohort of patients, and as such there are a number of limitations. The study included only 12 ICU patients and 21 non-ICU patients, and ideally would be repeated with a much larger patient cohort. Though the authors make claims about differences in lymphocyte and monocyte counts between patients and healthy controls, they did not report baseline laboratory findings for the control group. Additionally, severity of disease was classified based on whether or not patients were in the ICU. It would be interesting to contextualize the authors’ immunological findings with more specific metrics of disease severity or time course. Noting mortality, time from disease onset, pre-existing conditions, or severity of lung pathology in post-mortem tissue samples would paint a fuller picture of how to assess risk level and the relationship between severity of disease and immunopathology. Another limitation is the selection of cytokines and immune markers for analysis, as the selection criteria were based on the cell subsets and cytokine storm typically seen in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV patients. Unbiased cytokine screens and immune profiling may reveal novel therapeutic targets that were not included in this study.</p><p><b>Significance:</b> This study identifies potential therapeutic targets that could prevent acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and mortality in patients most severely affected by COVID-19. The authors propose testing monoclonal antibodies against IL6-R or GM-CSF to block recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and the subsequent cytokine storm in these patients.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.12.945576";"2020-03-30";"16:34:57";"2020-03-30T16:34:57";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945576v1";"945576"

The infected cells were scored by immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody against the N protein of SARS CoV-2. Chloroquine, lopinavir and remdesivir were used as reference drugs.</p><p>Twenty four out of 50 drugs exhibited antiviral activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.1-10mM. Among these, two stood ou: 1) the-anti helminthic drug niclosamide which exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 (IC50=0.28 mM). The broad-spectrum antiviral effect of niclosamide against SARS and MERS-CoV have been previously documented and recent evidence suggests that in may inhibit autophagy and reduce MERS C0V replication. 2) Ciclesonide, a corticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis, also exhibited antiviral efficacy but with a lower IC50 (4.33mM) compared to niclosamide. The antiviral effects of ciclesonide were directed against NSP15, a viral riboendonuclease which is the molecular target of this drug.</p><p>Limitations: The drugs were tested against SARS CoV-2 infectivity in vitro only, therefore preclinical studies in animals and clinical trials in patients will be need for validation of these drugs as therapeutic agents for COVID-19. In addition, niclosamide exhibits low adsorption pharmatokinetically which could be alleviated with further development of drug formulation to increase effective delivery of this drug to target tissues. Nonetheless, niclosamide and ciclesonide represent promising therapeutic agents against SARS CoV-2 given that other compounds tested in the same study including favipiravir (currently used in clinical trials) and atazanavir (predicted as the most potent antiviral drug by AI-inference modeling) did not exhibit antiviral activity in the current study.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.20.999730";"2020-03-30";"16:00:00";"2020-03-30T16:00:00";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.20.999730v3";"999730"

The study does not provide mechanistic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in cholangiocytes and the types of intrinsic anti-viral responses induced by cholangiocytes when infected. In addition, because the study relies on the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells only through ACE2, it cannot discount the possibility that the virus can infect hepatocytes through mechanisms other than ACE2-mediated entry. Furthermore, because the scRNA-seq analysis were performed on healthy liver samples, one cannot draw any definitive conclusions about gene expression states (including ACE2 expression in liver cell types) in system-wide inflammatory contexts.</p><p>Significance of the finding: This article with other studies on liver damage in COVID patients suggests that liver damage observed in COVID patients is more due to inflammatory cytokines than direct infection of the liver. Even if cholangiocytes are infectable by SARS-CoV-2 (which was demonstrated by human liver ductal organoid study (10.1101/2020.03.16.990317)), published clinical data show no significant increase in bile duct injury related indexes (i.e. alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin).

The results showed that the SARS-CoV-specific antibody CR3022 can potently bind 2019-nCoV RBD.</p><p>Major findings<br>The structure of the 2019-nCoV spike RBD and its conformation in complex with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) was modeled in silico and compared with the SARS-CoV RBD structure. The models predicted very similar RBD-ACE2 interactions for both viruses. The binding capacity of representative SARS-CoV-RBD specific monoclonal antibodies (m396, CR3014, and CR3022) to recombinant 2019-nCoV RBD was then investigated by ELISA and their binding kinetics studied using biolayer interferometry. The analysis showed that only CR3022 was able to bind 2019-nCoV RBD with high affinity (KD of 6.3 nM), however it did not interfere with ACE2 binding. Antibodies m396 and CR3014, which target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein.</p><p>Limitations<br>The 2019-nCoV RBD largely differ from the SARS-CoV at the C-terminus residues, which drastically impact the cross-reactivity of antibodies described for other B beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV.  This study claims that CR3022 antibody could be a potential candidate for therapy. However, none of the antibodies assayed in this work showed cross-reactivity with the ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV, essential for the replication of this virus. Furthermore, neutralization assays with 2019-nCoV virus or pseudovirus were not performed. Although the use of neutralizing antibodies is an interesting approach, these results suggest that it is critical the development of novel monoclonal antibodies able to specifically bind 2019-nCoV spike protein.</p><p>Reviewed by D.L.O as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</p>";"10.1101/2020.01.28.923011";"2020-03-31";"02:52:06";"2020-03-31T02:52:06";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011v1";"923011"

All patients but one recovered from disease. Interestingly, the patient that did not recover had less SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells circulating compared to other patients.</p><p>Plasma from all patients reacted to trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but no HIV BG505 trimer. Furthermore, plasma from patients recognized the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2 but had little to no cross-reactivity against the RBD of related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, suggesting significant differences between the RBDs of the different viruses. Negligible levels of cross-neutralization using pseudoviruses bearing Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, were observed, corroborating the ELISA cross-reactivity assays on the RBDs.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific B cells constituted 0.005-0.065% of the total B cell population and 0.023-0.329% of the memory subpopulation. SARS-CoV specific IgG memory B cells were single cell sorted to sequence the antibody genes that were subsequently expressed as recombinant IgG1 antibodies. From this library, 206 antibodies with different binding capacities were obtained. No discernible patterns of VH usage were found in the 206 antibodies suggesting immunologically distinct responses to the infection.

Further analyses in one of the patient derived clones, showed that the antibodies from three different timepoints did not group together in phylogenetic analysis, suggesting selection during early infection.</p><p>Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 13 antibodies were found to have 10-8 tp 10-9 dissociation constants (Kd). Of the 13 antibodies, two showed 98-99% blocking of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 receptor binding in competition assays. Thus, low Kd values alone did not predict ACE2 competing capacities. Consistent with competition assays the two antibodies that show high ACE2 blocking (P2C-2F6 and P2C-1F11) were the most capable of neutralizing pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (IC50 of 0.06 and 0.03 µg/mL, respectively).

Peripheral blood was collected from hospitalized ICU (n=12) and non-ICU (n=21) patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV and from healthy controls (n=10) in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology China (Hefei, Anhui). Immune analysis was conducted by flow cytometry. 2019-nCoV patients had decreased lymphocyte, monocyte, and CD4 T cell counts compared to healthy controls. ICU patients had fewer lymphocytes than non-ICU patients. CD4 T cells of 2019-nCoV patients expressed higher levels of activation markers (OX40, CD69, CD38, CD44) and exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim3) than those of healthy controls. CD4 cells of ICU patients expressed significantly higher levels of OX40, PD-1, and Tim3 than those of non-ICU patients. 2019-nCoV patients had higher percentages of CD4 T cells co-expressing GM-CSF and IL-6 compared to healthy controls, while ICU patients had a markedly higher percentage of GM-CSF+ IFN-γ+ CD4 T cells than non-ICU patients. The CD4 T cells of nCoV patients and healthy controls showed no differences in TNF-α secretion.</p><p>The CD8 T cells of 2019-nCoV patients also showed higher expression of activation markers CD69, CD38, and CD44, as well as exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim3, compared to healthy controls. CD8 T cells of ICU patients expressed higher levels of GM-CSF than those of non-ICU patients and healthy controls. No IL-6 or TNF-α was found in the CD8 T cells of any group. There were no differences in numbers of NK cells or B cells in 2019-nCoV patients and healthy controls, nor was there any GM-CSF or IL-6 secretion from these cells in either group.</p><p>Percentages of CD14+ CD16+ GM-CSF+ and CD14+ CD16+ IL-6+ inflammatory monocytes were significantly increased in nCoV patients compared to healthy controls; in particular, patients in the ICU had greater percentages of CD14+ CD16+ IL-6+ monocytes than non-ICU patients. The authors suggest that in 2019-nCoV patients, pathogenic Th1 cells produce GM-CSF, recruiting CD14+ CD16+ inflammatory monocytes that secrete high levels of IL-6. These may enter pulmonary circulation and damage lung tissue while initiating the cytokine storm that causes mortality in severe cases. This is consistent with the cytokine storm seen in similar coronaviruses, as IL-6, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF are key inflammatory mediators seen in patients with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.</p><p>Limitations of the study: Though the results of this study open questions for further investigation, this is an early study on a small cohort of patients, and as such there are a number of limitations. The study included only 12 ICU patients and 21 non-ICU patients, and ideally would be repeated with a much larger patient cohort. Though the authors make claims about differences in lymphocyte and monocyte counts between patients and healthy controls, they did not report baseline laboratory findings for the control group. Additionally, severity of disease was classified based on whether or not patients were in the ICU. It would be interesting to contextualize the authors’ immunological findings with more specific metrics of disease severity or time course. Noting mortality, time from disease onset, pre-existing conditions, or severity of lung pathology in post-mortem tissue samples would paint a fuller picture of how to assess risk level and the relationship between severity of disease and immunopathology. Another limitation is the selection of cytokines and immune markers for analysis, as the selection criteria were based on the cell subsets and cytokine storm typically seen in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV patients. Unbiased cytokine screens and immune profiling may reveal novel therapeutic targets that were not included in this study.</p><p>Significance: This study identifies potential therapeutic targets that could prevent acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and mortality in patients most severely affected by COVID-19. The authors propose testing monoclonal antibodies against IL6-R or GM-CSF to block recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and the subsequent cytokine storm in these patients.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.12.945576";"2020-04-01";"00:09:30";"2020-04-01T00:09:30";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945576v1";"945576"

For identifying mAbs, supernatants of a collection of 51 hybridomas raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) were screened by ELISA for cross-reactivity against the spike protein of SARS-CoN2 (SARS2-S). Hybridomas were derived from immunized transgenic H2L2 mice (chimeric for fully human VH-VL and rat constant region). Four SARS-S hybridomas displayed cross-reactivity with SARS2-S, one of which (47D11) exhibited cross-neutralizing activity for SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV infection. A recombinant, fully human IgG1 isotype antibody was generated and used for further characterization.</p><p>The humanized 47D11 antibody inhibited infection of VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 0.19 and 0.57 μg/ml respectively. 47D11 mAb bound a conserved epitope on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) explaining its ability to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 47D11 was shown to target the S1B RBD of SARS-S and SARS2-S with similar affinities. Interestingly, binding of 47D11 to SARS-S1B and SARS2-S1B did not interfere with S1B binding to ACE2 receptor-expressing cells assayed by flow cytometry.</p><p>Limitations: These results show that the human 47D11 antibody neutralizes SARS-CoV and SARS-Cov2 infectivity via an as yet unknown mechanism that is different from receptor binding interference. Alternative mechanisms were proposed but these as yet remain to be tested in the context of SARS-CoV2. From a therapeutic standpoint and in the absence of in vivo data, it is unclear whether the 47D11 ab can alter the course of infection in an infected host through virus clearance or protect an uninfected host that is exposed to the virus. There is a precedent for the latter possibility as it relates to SARS-CoV  that was cited by the authors and could turn out to be true for SARS-CoV2.</p><p>Relevance: This study enabled the identification of novel neutralizing antibody against COV-that could potentially be used as first line of treatment in the near future to reduce the viral load and adverse effects in infected patients. In addition, neutralizing antibodies such as 47D11 represent promising reagents for developing antigen-antibody-based detection test kits and assays.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.11.987958";"2020-03-31";"22:08:38";"2020-03-31T22:08:38";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.11.987958v1";"987958"

In line with this, the authors tested cross-reactivity of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) previously generated against the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein involved in viral entry. One of the screened mAb, 1A9, was able to bind and cross-neutralize multiple strains of SARS-CoV, as well as, detect the S protein in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. mAb 1A9 was generated using an immunogenic fragment in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV and binds through a novel epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1111-1130. It is important to note that CD8+ T lymphocyte epitopes overlap with these residues, suggesting that S2 subunit could be involved in inducing both, humoral and cell-mediated immunity.</p><p><b>Critical analysis: </b>The authors used previously generated mouse mAbs against the S protein in SARS-CoV expressed in mammalian cell line. Future experimental validation using COVID-19 patient samples is needed to validate these findings. In addition, the results of these studies are predominantly based on in vitro experiments and so, evaluating the effects of the mAb 1A9 in an animal model infected with this virus will help us better understand the host immune responses in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic vaccines.</p><p><b>Significance: </b>This study identified mAbs that recognize the new coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2.

Viral presence was assessed in nose, throat and rectum through RT-PCR and viral culture. SARS-CoV-2 replication was confirmed in the respiratory track (including nasal samples), and it was also detected in ileum. Viral nucleocapsid detection by IHC showed infection of type I and II pneumocytes and epithelia. Virus was found to peak between 2 and 4 days after administration and reached higher levels in aged vs. young animals. The early peak is consistent with data in patients and contrasts to SARS-CoV replication. SARS-CoV-2 reached levels below detection between 8 and 21 days after inoculation and macaques established antibody immunity against the virus by day 14. There were histopathological alteration in lung, but no overt clinical signs. At day 4 post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2, two of four animals presented foci of pulmonary consolidation, with limited areas of alveolar edema and pneumonia, as well as immune cell infiltration. In sum, cynomolgus macaques are permissive to SARS- CoV-2 and develop lung pathology (less severe than SARC-CoV, but more severe than MERS-CoV).</p><p>Limitations:<br>Even though cynomolgus macaques were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication, it is unclear if the viral load reaches levels comparable to humans and there wasn’t overt clinical pathology.</p><p>Relevance:<br>The development of platforms in which to carry out relevant experimentation on SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology is of great urgency. Cynomolgus macaques offer an environment in which viral replication can happen, albeit in a limited way and without translating into clinically relevant symptoms.

The authors did not perform the definitive experiment using SARSCoV2 virus and thus their speculation that it would induce the same increase in ACE2 expression is only a speculation.</p><p>Relevance: Since ACE2 is required for the entry of 2019-nCoV in humans, it is interesting to know the cues (poly(I:C), TBK activation) that upregulate these receptors and thereby, increase the chances of infection. It is also relevant to learn that if a person has a prior infection with some form of ACE2 inducing viruses, it makes that person more susceptible to a subsequent 2019-nCoV infection, which might be helpful for clinicians to be particularly alert in monitoring such patients. Also, it gives us some insight into why there is such a broad spectrum of patient susceptibilities to this infection.</p><p>Reviewed by Divya Jha/Francesca Cossarini as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.24.963348";"2020-04-02";"20:18:10";"2020-04-02T20:18:10";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.963348v1";"963348"

Despite ACE2 being expressed in both lung alveolar epithelial cells and small intestine enterocytes, respiratory problems are the most common symptom after viral infection while intestinal symptoms are much less frequent. Thus, the authors here investigate the biology behind the observed protection of the intestinal epithelium from SARS-CoV-2. Human defensin 5 (HD5), produced by Paneth cells in the small intestine, was shown to interact with human ACE2, with a binding affinity of 39.3 nM by biolayer interferometry (BLI). A blocking experiment using different doses of HD5 coating ACE2 showed that HD5 lowered viral spike protein S1 binding to ACE2. Further, a molecular dynamic simulation demonstrated a strong intermolecular interaction between HD5 and the ACE2 ligand binding domain. To test HD5 inhibitory effect on S1 binding to ACE2, human intestinal epithelium Caco-2 cells were preincubated with HD5. Preincubation strongly reduced adherence of S1 to surface of cells. HD5 was effective at a concentration as low as 10 µg/mL, comparable to the concentration found in the intestinal fluid.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b><br>The study focuses exclusively on intestinal cells. However, HD5 could have been tested to block ACE2-S1 binding in human lung epithelial cells as a potential treatment strategy. It would be useful to know whether HD5 could also prevent viral entry in lung cells.</p><p><b>Relevance:</b><br>This work provides the first understanding of the different efficiency of viral entry and infection among ACE2-expressing cells and tissues. Specifically, the authors show that human defensin 5 produced in the small intestine is able to block binding between S1 and ACE2 necessary for viral entry into cells. The study provides a plausible explanation on why few patients show intestinal symptoms and suggests that patients with intestinal disease that decrease defensins’ production may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. It also indicates that HD5 could be used as a molecule to be exogenously administered to patients to prevent viral infection in lung epithelial cells.</p><p><i>Review by Erica Dalla as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.29.013490";"2020-04-09";"15:16:59";"2020-04-09T15:16:59";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.013490v1";"013490"

They found that in their hands 143/ 150 samples tested positive when the extraction was performed according to WHO recommendations. Interistingly, 138/ 150 tested positive when RT-qPCR was run directly from preheated (95C) samples (NPswabs).

So, keeping optimal conditions for each procedure (it is non pre-heat for RTqPCR with extraction and pre-heat for direct RTqPCR) the extraction procedure augments diagnostic sensitivity (considering equivalent input). This is also in agreement with the higher CTs observed for individual samples tested by DIRECT RTqPCR during the factibility and setting up steps (preliminary estimation of analytical sensitivity?). <br>2) It would be great if the authors could add data to better describe the performance of the direct RTqPCR, specially its robustness (repeatibility and reproducibility) analytical sensitivity and specificity.

NHC activity introduced mutations in the viral (but not cellular) RNA in a dose dependent manner that directly correlated with a decrease in viral titers. Authors show that NHC inhibited multiple genetically distinct Bat-CoV viruses in human primary epithelial cells without affecting cell viability even at high concentrations (100 μM). Prophylactic oral administration of NHC in C57BL/6 mice reduce lung titers of SARS-CoV and prevented weight loss and hemorrhage. Therapeutic administration of NHC in C57BL/6 mice 12 hours post infected with SARS-CoV reduced acute lung injury, viral titer, and lung hemorrhage. The degree of clinical benefit was dependent on the time of treatment initiation post infection. The authors also demonstrate that NHC reduces MERS-CoV infection titers, pathogenesis, and viral RNA in prophylactic and therapeutic settings.</p><p>Caveats: Most of the experiments were conducted using MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV and a few experiments were conducted using other strains of CoV as opposed to SARS-CoV-2. The authors note the core residues that make up the RNA interaction sites (which constitutes the NHC interaction sites) are highly conserved among CoV and because of this conservation their understanding is that NHC can inhibit a broad-spectrum of CoV including SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>In addition, the temporal diminishing effectiveness of NHC on clinical outcome when NHC was used therapeutically is concerning. However, the longer window (7-10 days) for clinical disease onset in human patients from the time of infection compared to that of mice (24-48 hours), may associate with increased NHC effectiveness in the clinic.</p><p>Importance: Prophylactic or therapeutic oral administration of NHC reduces lung titers and prevents acute lung failure in C57B\6 mice infected with CoV.

One blood sample was taken from each patient within 12 hours post-treatment (severe stage of disease), and a total of three blood samples were taken 5 and 7 days post-treatment (recovery stage of disease). A total of 13,289 cells were analyzed post-quality control and compared to 55,948 previously published profiles of healthy PBMCs.</p><p>The authors identified a subpopulation of pro-inflammatory CD14+ monocyte/macrophages enriched in the severe stage of COVID-19, characterized by the upregulation of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, and CXCL8. In addition, a cluster of plasma cells and subpopulations of effector CD8+ T cells were found to be enriched in both the severe and recovery stages. The authors attribute this finding to the fact that Tocilizumab therapy does not necessarily compromise the anti-viral immune response.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br><i>Technical</i><br>Only two patients were included in this analysis. Though both patients were classified under severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of therapy, patients PZ and PW were at significantly different stages of the disease; PZ had an SpO2 &lt; 93%, and PW presented with respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, and SpO2 &lt; 93% under high flow oxygen.</p><p>Of note, PBMCs collected from patients were compared to previously published healthy controls. However, this is not a proper control; cells collected from COVID-19 patients that had not been treated with Tocilizumab are needed. Therefore, this comparison is not sufficient to attribute significant differences in clustering patterns to Tocilizumab treatment. Moreover, without additional details concerning improvement of clinical symptoms after Tocilizumab therapy at days 5 and 7, there is a lack of data supporting the claim that these timepoints (only a week into therapy) necessarily represent a stage of recovery in COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Finally, PBMCs attributed to severe disease (presumably to define the pre-treatment stage) were collected after administration of Tocilizumab, instead of before administration to establish an untreated baseline control. In addition, PBMCs attributed to the recovery stage were collected at timepoints that were not necessarily the same for both patients. Recovery stage cells from patient PZ were collected 5 days post-treatment, whereas recovery stage cells from patient PW were collected 5 and 7 days post-treatment. Because it was not clarified, it must be assumed that the 5 and 7 day samples from patient PW were combined to represent the recovery stage for that patient, but this yields an inconsistent comparison between the two patients.</p><p><i>Biological</i> <br>Enrichment of pro-inflammatory monocyte/macrophages in patients with severe infections is expected. The study is missing a more detailed characterization of cluster 9 (identified as the group of myeloid cells unique to the severe stage) to potentially establish a novel gene program specific to COVID-19. This is furthered by the fact that despite authors' claims, cluster 9 technically belongs to both the severe and recovery stages rather than being stage-specific. It is notable that transcriptionally, the acute inflammatory response is reduced in the defined recovery stage cells.</p><p>Other findings are expected, including the persistence of plasma B cells and effector CD8+ T cells in response to a viral infection. In addition to the technical limitations aforementioned, to better assess the impact of Tocilizumab on the inflammatory response, both transcriptional and translational outcomes must be investigated. It is not sufficient to account the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to Tocilizumab treatment without the proper controls.</p><p><u>Significance</u><br>IL-6R antagonists, like Tocilizumab and Sarilumab, have been raised as potential therapeutics for COVID-19 as a means of reducing the hyper-inflammation seen in patients. Understanding the cellular changes that occur during and after therapy is important to determining the efficacy of such therapy and whether inhibition of IL-6 signaling compromises other adaptive immune mechanisms needed for a complete anti-viral response. This study contributes to that analysis at the single-cell level.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.08.029769";"2020-04-13";"22:50:24";"2020-04-13T22:50:24";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.029769v1";"029769"

Using pVAC, a computational toolkit developed by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy to predict cancer neoantigens presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, they analyzed the binding affinity of 9360 HLA-I alleles to 9-mer epitopes derived from all 11 viral proteins spanning the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. They identified 6,748 epitope – HLA-I pairs, which consisted of 1,103 unique 9-mer epitopes and 1,022 HLA class I alleles, with a predicted binding affinity Kd &lt; 500 nM. Each viral protein was predicted to generate immunogenic epitopes (12 to 684 epitopes, with a median of 31) and some of these epitopes could bind to multiple HLA-I alleles (1 to 55 alleles, with a median of 3). The study tested 2987 HLA-A, 3707 HLA-B and 2666 HLA-C alleles, of which majority of viral epitopes were predicted to bind HLA-B alleles (295 HLA-A, 614 HLA-B and 113 HLA-C). Of note, 10 of the 30 experimentally validated immunogenic SARS-CoV HLA-I epitopes were identified among current SARS-CoV-2 predicted epitopes. Together, this work shows that a diverse set of HLA alleles can potentially bind to a wide variety of viral peptides, suggesting the presence of strong cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients and serves as a valuable  resource for SARS-CoV-2 epitope selection and experimental validation efforts, which would guide the design of T-cell based vaccination strategies against COVID-19.</p><p><b>Limitations</b></p><p>A limitation of this study is that it identifies only 9-mers peptides with &lt;500 nM binding affinity, but it does not look for 8-mer or 10-mer peptides and excludes peptides with &gt;500 nM affinity but within statistical rank-cutoff of 2%, which could still generate an immune response to the virus. Another limitation is that the authors did not evaluate epitope - HLA-II pairs, even though HLA class II is also important in the context of viral immune responses. Studies have shown that convalescent sera of recovered COVID-19 patients contain neutralizing antibodies, which can be used as an early treatment for recipient patients or as a prophylactic for at-risk or exposed patients. Generation of these antibodies require viral detection by B cells, aided by antigen presentation by HLA II molecules to CD4 T cells, which stimulates B cells to differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells. Thus, further study could provide insight into the ability to potentially initiate potent antibody responses by identifying longer peptides and their affinity for class II variants.</p><p><b>Significance</b></p><p>This study predicts 6,748 unique pMHC complexes across the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome and global variety of HLA alleles, highlighting that a wide variety of patients can generate a CTL-mediated response to infection. These results can help explain the heterogeneity of COVID-19 disease phenotypes and can be used to monitor CD8+ T cell responses across patients with many different haplotypes. Since SARS-CoV-2 proteome is quite large to be screened experimentally for immunogenic epitopes in an unbiased fashion, these in silico findings guide the selection of immunogenic epitopes for functional validation of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, which can be used in vaccine development and pre-clinical treatment studies. Moreover, all data generated in this study is publicly available for further investigation, which is critical for clinical translation in the evolving pandemic.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Miriam Saffern as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p><p><i>References</i><br>Casadevall A, Pirofski LA.

TMPRSS2<br> gene was contained in a set of three highly correlated networks <br>exhibiting strong enrichments for IL13-induced mucus secretory cell <br>genes and canonically Type-2 inflammation pathways. ACE2 gene was correlated with interferon response and cytotoxic immune signaling eigengene enrichment.  <br>-TMPRSS2 upregulated and ACE2 downregulated upon rIL13 treatment in muco-ciliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture; supporting transcriptome analyses. Also, scRNAseq data from tracheal airway epithelial cultures chronically stimulated with IL-13 also showed congruent changes in TMPRSS2 and ACE2. <br>- Used metagenomic analysis from dataset to find 18 asymptomatic children with four different coronaviral sequences (CoV; OC43, JKU1, 229E, NL63). Compared 11 subjects with highest CoV infection to 571 CoV-naïve subjects, with 37 rhinovirus (HRV)-infected subjects serving as ‘basal/normal respiratory virus’ comparators.  <br>- Induction of cytotoxic immune response was considerably higher in CoV-infected subjects, compared to HRV-infected individuals. IL10, IL1B, IFNG, IFNA2, STAT1, and ACE2 upregulation shared for CoV or HRV infections. IL6 upregulated and genes associated with CD8 T cells, DCs and NK cells specifically enriched in CoV infections. <br>- Identified eQTLs for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using GALA II dataset and used multi-variable modeling to estimate the relative contribution of these factors to population variation in these genes (not reviewed here).</p><p><u>Limitations</u> <br>- Dataset is large, but having asthmatic young subjects as part of GALA II study might skew WGCNA analyses to enrich for T2 biomarkers and secretory phenotype genes. Will be important to replicate analyses in another independent non-COPD/allergy/asthma dataset and reconcile ACE2+TMPRSS2 correlation with T2 emergence.  <br>- Provides rationale for increased cytotoxic responses in CoVID-19 cases, but no explanation for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 anti-correlative trends in epithelia upon T2 inflammation.  <br>- Will need ALI experiments with IL13 addition in CoV-2 infection models to ascertain changes in ACE2/TMPRSS2 to be consistent with existing patient data for COVID-19.</p><p><u>Significance</u> <br>- Study strongly suggests airway epithelial TMPRSS2 expression is highly upregulated upon Type 2 inflammation, specifically by IL13 stimulation of epithelia. Also, ACE2 expression (and therefore viral infectivity) is inextricably linked to interferon response and could sabotage initial inflammation.  <br>- Changes in immune contextures observed in asymptomatic CoV+/HRV+ subjects suggest remodeling of airway epithelia even after viral resolution, which can impact future infections with COVID-19 and outcomes. <br>- Results showing IL10, IL1B, IL6 enrichment and cytotoxic programs (CD8, NK, DC) in CoV+ subjects supports other concurrent studies showing their importance in cytokine storm and points to broader conserved inflammatory pathways worth targeting in COVID-19.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Samarth Hegde as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.09.034454";"2020-04-13";"14:59:39";"2020-04-13T14:59:39";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.034454v1";"034454"

The authors used constant-pH Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, to determine  binding affinities of four  SARS-Cov monoclonal antibody fragments (CR3022, 80R, m39, F26G29) to SARS-Cov2, as well as  the titratable amino acids involved in the interactions. They also compared antibody binding affinities to the binding affinity of S RBD of SARS-Cov1 and 2 to  the ACE2 receptor to ensure that antibody binding affinities were higher compared to those of S RBD/ACE2. They identified CR3022 as the Ab having the highest affinity with SARS-Cov2 RBD. Based on their simulations they were able to suggest some 3 amino acid modifications on CR3022, to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-Cov2 RBD. The computational analysis of interactions between SARS-CoV-1 S RBD proteins and the S RBD-specific neutralizing mAbs (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022) recapitulated previous experimental results suggesting that the approach was valid. The only mAb with measured affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD protein by BLI assay was CR3020, which also exhibited the highest theoretical binding affinity determined in the present study.</p><p><b>Limitations</b><br>Simulations were performed on S RBD proteins alone. However, given that the S protein is trimeric, structure modifications and/or conformational changes in the S protein trimer could alter antibody  binding affinity. In addition, while CR3022 has been shown to bind S RBD, it did not neutralize SARS-Cov2 in vitro. The CR3022 modifications suggested by the authors could enhance the binding affinitys and the neutralizing potential of CR3022, but this is currently hypothetical and remains to be tested.</p><p><b>Significance</b><br>These results are in agreement with previous experimental studies where CR3022 was shown to bind SARS-Cov2 RBD (10.1101:2020.01.28.923011, 10.1126/science.abb7269) and confirm the validity of the approach.  A human monoclonal antibody against SARS-Cov2 RBD could be used as therapeutics to treat patients with severe COVID-19, by inhibiting ACE2/RBD interaction.</p><p><b>Credit</b><br><i>Reviewed by Emma Risson as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.<br>Edited by K Alexandropoulos</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.05.026377";"2020-04-13";"13:07:00";"2020-04-13T13:07:00";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.026377v1";"026377"

The drug was rapidly pushed to clinical testing and approved within weeks as a recommended COVID-19 treatment by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China[1]. However, CQ or HCQ, sometimes used in combination with anti-diabetic drug metformin, may have serious toxic side-effects that have not been appropriately addressed.<br>The authors, who study metformin with CQ or HCQ as potential anti-cancer drugs in mice, investigated  their toxicity in mice. They found that the combination was lethal in at least 40% of nude mice, tumour-bearing or not. Similar results were obtained in non-immunocompromised mice. They observed that nude mice treated with HCQ+metformin presented an increased number of autophagosomes in the heart, liver and kidneys. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were also elevated in treatment groups compared to control vehicle-treated mice.</p><p>Critical analysis:<br>The authors of this article performed studies exclusively in mice. They note that the lethal doses of CQ or HCQ are similar to those in humans with allometric scaling. However, the side-effects of the combinations observed in mice must yet be confirmed in humans. The exact etiology behind the increased lethality in treated mice was not discussed. As both metformin and QC or HQC exert hypoglycemic effects, together with observed side effects such as cardiomyopathy and retinopathy induced by QC and  HQC, point to exacerbated adverse side effects caused by the combined treatment. The dose of 500mg twice per day of CQ recommended in China can rapidly approach a dangerous dose in humans[1]. Indeed, CQ poisoning has already been reported in Nigeria and resulted in at least one death in Arizona, USA.</p><p>Relevance to current epidemic:<br>Given that metformin is widely used as an anti-diabetic drug, the article acts as a word of caution for individuals and physicians who have been taking and prescribing these drug combinations prior to adequate clinical trials. The clinical relevance of treating COVID-19 patients with CQ+metformin or HCQ+metformin is yet to be confirmed or rejected.</p><p>References:<br>1. Wong et al.

The spike (S) protein plays an essential role in this step (1). This work sheds light on the particularities of the S protein from SARS-CoV2 and compares it to previously existing coronaviral S proteins. SARS-CoV2 S protein showed stronger affinity for hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV. Previous work by this group had established the potential of a previous version of the peptide (EK1) in reducing the infectivity of several coronavirus by blocking the S protein interactions with the host cell (2). In this work, authors present an improved EK1C4 version of this peptide. In vitro experiments on human cells showed EK1C4-mediated reduction of the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus. Administration of EK1C4 in prophylaxis or shortly after exposure to the HCoV-OC43 coronavirus protected newborn mice from virus-induced lethality.</p><p>Limitations:<br>This work suggests that the furin cleavage site from CoV2-S could be related to its increased infectivity compared to CoV-S. However, a previous report suggested that the enhanced cell-to-cell fusion mediated by this furin cleavage might not necessarily translate into enhanced viral infectivity (3). The mutation of this site, or inhibition of furin in 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV or CoV-2 S proteins, could inform if this mechanism is actually involved in SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis, and potentially suggest additional routes for therapeutic intervention. <br>The in vivo model used to address the protective potential of EK1C4 is based on the coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Further work should aim to establish the potential of EK1C4 for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 replication in more relevant animal models (e.g. Rhesus Macaques or hACE2 mice). It is, however, acknowledged, that experimentation in vitro included both SARS-CoV2 and the same HCoV-OC43 used in the in vivo infection model.<br>Even though the safety of the unmodified EK1 peptide in mice had been previously examined (2), the potential side effects and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of EK1C4 in the in vivo setting are not addressed in this report.</p><p>Relevance:<br>The development of prophylactic drugs against viral infection is a paramount element of epidemic control, specially in the time before a vaccine can be readily available. Similar strategies have been followed in the past in response to threats of this nature (4,5). This work’s relevance is limited by the absence of relevant animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacological analyses would also be necessary to ensure the safety of EK1C4 in animal models before a potential safety analysis in human subjects.</p><p>1. 	Heald-Sargent T, Gallagher T.

Sixty-seven (67) antigens from across subtypes of coronaviruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and other viruses, were printed onto microarrays, probed with human sera, and analyzed. Five (5) serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were tested as part of a study that monitored acute respiratory infection cases. Four out of five (4/5) sera samples showed high IgG seroreactivity across the 4 common human coronaviruses. All sera showed low IgG seroreactivity to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>The S1 domain of the spike protein is suggested to be subtype specific as it demonstrated very low cross-reactivity among the novel coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and between the novel coronal viruses and common human coronaviruses. In contrast, the S2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid (NP) protein showed low levels of cross-reactivity between the coronavirus subtypes, suggesting the presence of more conserved antigenic domains. Therefore, the authors conclude that the S1 domain is an ideal candidate for virus-specific serologic assays.</p><p>Importance<br>This study provides insights into the potential cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Understanding cross-reactivity is useful because it can help in the development of sensitive and specific serological assays that can test for COVID-19. Additionally, studies such as this can help inform vaccine development and indicate which antigens would be optimal to target.</p><p>Limitations<br>This study is limited by a small sample size (n=5) of serum samples that all came from students who were part of the same college resident community at The University of Maryland. A greatest limitation is the lack of serum samples from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the MFI of 2019-nCov from these naïve samples (in particular sera 4) is not zero.  This indicates that while relatively low, there is some cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the S1 domain. A larger sample size and samples from SARS-CoV2 infected patients may be needed to confirm the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.</p><p><i>Review by Jamie Redes as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.24.006544";"2020-04-10";"17:37:28";"2020-04-10T17:37:28";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.006544v1";"006544"

The characterization of the surface proteins in this study began with an assessment of the peptide sequences in order to identify hydrophilicity indices and protein instability indices using the Port-Param tool in ExPASy. All three surface proteins were calculated to have an instability score under 40 indicating that they were stable. Linear epitopes were identified on the basis of surface probability and antigenicity, excluding regions of glycosylation. Using BepiPred 2.0 (with a cutoff value of 0.35) and ABCpred (with a cutoff value of 0.51), 4 linear B cell epitopes were predicted for the S protein, 1 epitope for the E protein, and 1 epitope for the M protein. For structural analysis, SARS-CoV assemblies published in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) acting as scaffolds for the SARS-CoV-2 S and E amino acid sequences were used for input into the SWISS-MODEL server in order to generate three-dimensional structural models for the assessment of conformational epitopes. Using Ellipro (cutoff value of 0.063) and SEPPA (cutoff value of 0.5), 1 conformational epitope was identified for the S protein and 1 epitope was identified for the E protein, both of which are accessible on the surface of the virus. Finally, the Consurf Server was used to assess the conservation of these epitopes. All epitopes were conserved across the published SARS-CoV-2 genomes and one epitope of the spike protein was predicted to be the most stable across coronavirus phylogeny.</p><p>Critical Analysis/Limitations:<br>While this study provides a preliminary identification of potential linear and conformational B cell epitopes, the translational value of the epitopes described still needs extensive experimental validation to ascertain whether these elicit a humoral immune response. The conformational epitope analyses are also limited by the fact that they are based off of predicted 3D structure from homology comparisons and not direct crystal structures of the proteins themselves. Additionally, since there was not a published M protein with a high homology to SARS-CoV-2, no conformational epitopes were assessed for this protein. Finally, while evolutionary conservation is an important consideration in understanding the biology of the virus, conservation does not necessarily imply that these sites neutralize the virus or aid in non-neutralizing in vivo protection.</p><p>Relevance/Implications:<br>With further experimental validation that confirms that these epitopes induce effective antibody responses to the virus, the epitopes described can be used for the development of treatments and vaccines as well as better characterize the viral structure to more deeply understand pathogenesis.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.03.022723";"2020-04-10";"03:06:23";"2020-04-10T03:06:23";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.022723v1";"022723"

They tested infection with two SARS-CoV2 isolates, one from an environmental sample collected in the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan (F13-E) and the other from a human patient in Wuhan (CTan-H). <br><i>Ferrets</i> were inoculated with either of the two viruses by intranasal route with 105 pfu, and the viral replication was evaluated. Two ferrets from each group were euthanized on day 4 post infection (p.i.). AT day 4 p.i., viral RNA and infectious viruses were detected only in upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinate, upper palate, tonisls, but not in the trachea, lungs or other tissues. Viral RNA and virus titer in the remaining ferrets were monitored in nasal washes and rectal swabs on days 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 p.i. Viral RNA and infectious viruses were detected in nasal washes until day 8 p.i. One ferret in each group developed fever and loss of appetite on days 10 and 12 p.i., however, viral RNA was practically undetactable. These two ferrets showed severe lymphoplasmacytic perivasculitis and vasculitis in the lungs and lower antibody titers compare to other 4 ferrets. <br><i>Cats</i>. Five subadult 8-month-old domestic cats were inoculated with CTan-h virus and three uninfected cats were placed in a cage adjacent to each of the infected cats to monitor respiratory droplet transmission. Viral RNA was detected in the upper respiratory organs from all infected cats and in one out of three exposed cats. All infected (inoculated and exposed) cats developed elevated antibodies against SARS-CoV2. Viral replication studies with juvenile cats (70-100 days) revealed massive lesions in the nasal and tracheal mucosa epithelium and lungs of two inoculated cats which died or were euthanized on day 3 p.i., and infection in one out of three exposed cats. These results indicated SARS-CoV2 could replicate in cats, that juvenile cats were more susceptible that adults, and theat SARS-CoV2 could be transmit via respiratory droplets between cats. <br><i>Dogs and others.</i> Five 3-month-old beagle dogs were inoculated and housed with two uninoculated beagles in a room. Two virus inoculated dogs seroconverted, but others including two contact dogs were all seronegative for SARS-CoV2 and infectious virus was not detected in any swabs collected. Viral RNA was not detected in swabs from pigs, chickens, and ducks inoculated or contacted. These results indicated that dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks might have low or no susceptibility to SARS-CoV2.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study: </u><br>This manuscript describes the viral replication and clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV2 infection in ferrets, and the SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission in cats. Clinical and pathological analysis was not performed in cats, therefore the correlation of virus titer with symptoms severity in the adult and juvenile cats could not be determined. <br><u>The importance and implications for the current epidemics:</u><br>SARS-CoV-2 transmission to tigers, cats and dogs has been previously reported. It should be noted that this manuscript did not evaluate the transmission from cats to human. Nevertheless, it clearly showed higher susceptibility of ferrets and domestic cats to SARS-CoV-2. This data strongly indicates the need for surveillance of possible infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by domestic cats.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.30.015347";"2020-04-09";"23:44:12";"2020-04-09T23:44:12";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015347v1";"015347"

The peptide library was constructed with 966 linear peptides, each 15 amino acids long with a 5 amino acid overlap, based on the protein sequences encoded by the genome of the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. <br>To investigate crossreactivity between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, they tested rabbit monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid (N) in the microarray.  Antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 N displayed binding to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) peptides.  Polyclonal antibodies showed some crossreactivity to other epitopes from membrane (M), spike (S), ORF1ab and ORF8. This suggests that previous exposure to SARS-CoV-1 may induced antibodies recognizing both viruses. <br>Screening of IgM and IgG antibodies from 10 COVID-19 patients showed that many antibodies targeted peptides on M, N, S, Orf1ab, Orf3a, Orf7a, and Orf8 from SARS-CoV-2, while immunodominant epitopes with antibodies in more than 80 % COVID-19 patients were present in N, S and Orf3. It is shown that the receptor binding domain (RBD) resides on S protein and RBD is important for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells via ACE2. Among six epitopes on S protein, structural analysis predicted that three epitopes were located at the surface and three epitopes were located inside of the protein. Furthermore, some IgM antibodies from 1 patient and IgG antibodies from 2 patients bound to the same epitope (residue 456-460, FRKSN) which resided within the RBD, and structural analysis determined that this epitope was located in the region of the RBD loop that engages with ACE2.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study: </u><br>In addition to the limitations mentioned in the manuscript, it would have been informative to do the analysis over the course of the disease.

A total of 58 distinct PPI were characterized. A screen of viral-host PPI was also established by overexpressing all the SARS-CoV-2 genes with a Flag epitope into HEK293 cells and purifying each protein complex. Interacting host proteins were then identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. 251 cellular proteins were identified, such as subunits of ATPase, 40S ribosomal proteins, T complex proteins and proteasome related proteins, for a total of 631 viral-host PPI. Several interactions suggesting protein-mediated modulation of the immune response were identified, highlighting the multiple ways SARS-CoV-2 might reprogram infected cells. <br>Subsequently, the authors compared global proteome profiles of PBMCs from healthy donors (n=6) with PBMC from COVID-19 patients with mild (n=22) or severe (n=13) symptoms. 220 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between healthy donors and mild COVID-19 patients, and a pathway analysis showed a general activation of the innate immune response. 553 proteins were differentially expressed between the PBMC of mild and severe COVID-19 patients, most of them (95%) being downregulated in severe patients. Functional pathway analysis indicated a defect of T cell activation and function in severe COVID-19. There was also evidence suggesting reduced antibody secretion by B cells. Together, these results suggest a functional decline of adaptive immunity. A FACS analysis of PBMC from severe patients indicated higher levels of IL6 and IL8 but not IL17 compared to mild patients.<br>Finally, the authors focused on NKRF, an endogenous repressor of IL8/IL6 synthesis that was previously identified as interacting with SARS-Cov-2 nsp9,10,12,13 and 15. Individually expressed nsp9 and nsp10 (but not nsp12, nsp13, nsp15) induced both IL6 and IL8 in lung epithelial A459 cells, indicating that nsp9 and nsp10 may be directly involved in the induction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. The authors finally argue that nsp9 and nsp10 represent potential drug targets to prevent over-production of IL6 and IL8 in infected cells, and reducing the over-activation of neutrophils.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b><br>First, the authors seem to have forgotten to include the extended data in the manuscript, and their proteomic data does not seem to be publicly available for the moment, which limits greatly our analysis of their results.<br>While this work provides important data on host and viral PPI, only 19 interactions were identified by Y2H system but 52 with co-IP. The authors do not comment about what could lead to such differences between the two techniques and they don’t specify whether they detected the same interactions using the two techniques. <br>Moreover, the PBMC protein quantification was performed comparing bulk PBMC. Consequently, protein differences likely reflect differences in cell populations rather than cell-intrinsic differences in protein expression. While this analysis is still interesting, a similar experiment performed on pre-sorted specific cell populations would allow measuring proteome dynamics at a higher resolution.<br>Finally, the authors did not discussed their results in regards to another SARS-CoV-2 interactome of host-viral PPI that had been published previously [1]. This study reported 332 host-virus PPI, but no interaction of viral proteins with NKRF was found. Some interactions were found in both studies (eg. N and G3BP1, Orf6 and RAE1). However, the time point used to lyse the cells were different (40h previously vs 72h here), which could explain some of the differences.</p><p><b>Significance</b><br>The identification of many interactions between intra-viral and host-virus PPI provides an overview of host protein and pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2, which can lead to the identification of potential targets for drug development. <br>In the model proposed by the authors, nsp9 and nsp10 from SARS-Cov-2 induce an over-expression of IL6 and IL8 by lung epithelial cells, which recruits neutrophils and could lead to an excess in lung infiltration. Nsp9 has been shown to be essential for viral replication for SARS-Cov-1 [2], and shares a 97% homology with nsp9 from SARS-Cov-2 [3]. Further, nsp9 crystal structure was recently solved [3], which can help to develop drug inhibitors if this protein is further confirmed as being important for the virulence of SARS-Cov-2.</p><p>1.

Secondly the amount of HCQ they gave the mice is 60mg/kg. HCQ dosage for a male of 80kg is about 400mg/day which is about 5mg/kg or 12 times less. Similarly the amount of metformin they gave to the mice is 250mg/kg, the dosage of metformin for said male is about 1000mg/day which is about 12mg/kg or 20 times less. In both cases the amount of medication they gave the mice is way more than a human would take and they gave it to the mice for a lot longer (4 times longer) than a covid-19 treatment would last for.

The experiments were performed in cell culture medium, most likely containing less proteins and, thus, a higher unbound fraction. What was the protein binding of nelfinavir in this medium?  The translation of the IC50 to the in vivo situation needs to be done with a correction for difference in protein binding.<br>)2.

Also conducted scATACseq on kidney tissue specifically to map chromatin accessibility relevant to above genes.  <br>- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 predominantly detected in ciliated, club cells and type2 <br>alveolar cells, as well as proximal tubule cells of kidney, and cholangiocytes in liver (agreeing with human data). Some differences exist in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression between human and NHP samples, especially in liver but also in lung.  <br>- Correlation analyses show immune-modulatory genes such as TMEM27, IDO2, DNAJC12, and ANPEP co-expressed with ACE2 upregulation in kidney. Also, IL6R gene expression correlated well with ACE2 in proximal tubule cells (agreeing with human data). <br>- scATACseq of kidney cells determined open chromatin regions with discrete ACE2 peaks in proximal tubule cells S3, and TF motifs for these regions were enriched in STAT1/STAT3 and IRF1 binding sites.</p><p><u>Limitations </u><br>- Variations in ACE2/TMPRSS2 gene expression between NHP and human tissues could arise due to differences in digestion and/or processing protocols hence biasing reads.

When we speak about antibodies modified following ACE2 surface (at the level of interactions with spike RBD, see Fig. 7 and its legend), we meant to modify residues of existing antibodies (active against the similar previous SARS-CoV-1, see Fig. 6 and its legend) for making those antibodies more efficient in binding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (i.e., see Fig. 8 about modified antibodies according to what reported in Table 3, and corresponding legends).</p><p>Modifying ACE2 in vivo in humans is theoretically possible (if we think about CRISPR-cas9 assays), but practically not reliable with our current technology, for arriving in the main affected tissues efficiently.</p><p>It also would not be sustainable and sufficient fast for treating this infection, with the major problem to deal with mutations directly introduced in vivo in human ACE2 enzyme that works efficiently in our cells.</p><p>Every time you mutate an enzyme directly in human you cannot predict exactly consequences of that mutation. It is instead more correct to use CRISPR-cas9 science in rare diseases, when you have to mutate a pathological variant in the correct amino acid for re-establishing the healthy wild type enzyme.</p><p>Finally, do not forget that ACE2 is just one of the several receptor enzymes used by viruses for entering human or mammalia cells.....</p><p>What we can do with ACE2, is preparing (i.e.) a recombinant (synthetic) ACE2 protein to administer it to patients (as we do with insuline). If the recombinant (synthetic) ACE2 is even mutated for making it more specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, it might target the virus in the blood slowing down the infection (on this concern you can read references 68 and 69 cited in our paper) and allowing our immune systems to build the right antibodies for killing the virus.</p><p>We need to believe in and trust scientific research and find the right funding resources for continuing to do good science.</p><p>I hope that your question was addressed in full.</p><p>Best,<br>CLP</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.17.046185";"2020-04-21";"09:58:58";"2020-04-21T09:58:58";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.046185v1";"046185"

CTL, HTL, and B cell linear epitopes were identified, scored, and percentile-ranked utilizing respective IEDB server tools. SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein, surface (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and several open reading frame proteins were screened in silico for potential CTL, HTL, and B cell epitopes. CTL epitopes were identified by the “MHC-I Binding Predictions” IEDB tool with default parameters of 1st, 2nd, and C-term amino acids; epitopes were ranked by total score combining proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport, and MHC scores combined. HTL epitopes were identified by the “MHC-II Binding Predictions” IEDB tool, which gives a percentile rank by combining 3 methods (viz. combinatorial library, SMM_align &amp; Sturniolo, score comparison with random five million 15-mer peptides within SWISSPROT). B cell linear epitopes were identified by the “B Cell epitope Prediction” IEDB tool, which searches continuous epitopes based on propensity scales for each amino acid.</p><p>From these proteins, 38 CTL top percentile ranked epitopes, 42 HTL top scorers, and 12 B cell top scorers were used for further analysis. Candidates were then analyzed for epitope conservation analysis (number of protein sequences containing that particular epitope), toxicity, population coverage, and overlap with one another. 9 epitopes that overlapped among all three types (CTL, HTL, and B cell linear) were then analyzed for interaction with HLA binders, showing stable binding with A*11:01, A*31:01, B3*01:01, and B1*09:01, and TAP, demonstrating ability to pass from cytoplasm into the ER. Two MEVs were formulated using the top CTL and HTL epitopes, which were then analyzed for physicochemical properties, allergenicity, and potential to induce IFN-gamma production. Final 3D modeling, refinement, and discontinuous B cell epitope analysis were completed to optimize the space-occupancy of the MEVs. This rendering was used to assess docking with TLR3, the major domain used by Ov-ASP-1. Codon adaptation optimization yielded cDNA capable of high expression in mammalian host cells. Taken together, this in-silico study produced two MEVs containing CTL, HTL, and B cell epitopes capable of eliciting potent cell-mediated and humoral responses for HLA types representing up to 96% (SD 31.17) of the population. Further in vitro study is warranted to confirm its clinical potential.</p><p><b>Limitations:<br></b><br>In silico approaches are based upon models, however accurate, that make certain assumptions and contain biases inherent to training data. Synthesizing and testing a few candidates alongside their initial findings would make this method far more robust. It remains to be seen the efficacy of screened epitopes and corresponding multi-epitope formulations function in vitro and in vivo models.</p><p><b>Significance:<br></b><br>This study reports an in silico approach to producing multi-epitope vaccines that can produce potent adaptive immune responses. Utilizing protein databases, established protein modeling, folding, and docking algorithms, as well as population analysis, the team identifies 38 MHCI-binding, 42 MHCII-binding, and 12 B cell epitopes that can be linked with Ov-ASP-1 adjuvant to form stable proteins. These proteins are shown to dock well with HLA-alleles, TAP, TLR3, and to induce IFN-gamma responses.</p><p><i>Review by Matthew Lin as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.<br></i></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.01.019299";"2020-04-21";"02:25:55";"2020-04-21T02:25:55";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.019299v1";"019299"

The authors also discuss potential implications for COVID-19 therapy, as they compare AZT to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), and further suggest the use of ciprofloxacin (CPX) based on acido-tropic lipophilic weak base properties of these drugs. The study examines AZT’s mechanism of action in vitro on cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelial cells and find: <br>-	AZT elicits pH normalization in trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes from their subtly increased acidification in CF epithelial cells. <br>-	AZT reduces inflammatory mediators in CF lung epithelial cells with or without bacterial products challenge: basal NFκB activation was reduced by 50% and by 40% in bacterial challenge; basal IL-8 secretion was reduced by almost 70 %, and by approximatively 33% after bacterial product challenge.<br>-	AZT corrects Furin activity in CF cells’ intracellular organelles and leads to a decrease in abundance of the profibrotic mediator TGF-beta.</p><p>Limitations: <br>This study is conducted in-vitro on respiratory epithelial cells affected by cystic fibrosis, and even though normal human epithelial cells were included in some experiments, they were not treated with AZT or CPX. The AZT results are derived from only 3 independent in-vitro experiments. The number of experiments supporting the CPX is not clear, nor why different cell types were used in AZT and CPX experiments. Very little is shown, except for TGN pH normalization, to suggest replication of AZT’s results with CPX. <br>The biological mechanism linking pH increase in the TGN and the endosome and the decrease in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effect in CF epithelial cell would need to be further explored.<br>The hypothesis of similar effect in pH shift in normal cells or in a SARS-CoV2 affected cells would need to be substantiated by experimental data.</p><p>Findings implications: As we are desperately looking for a COVID-19 therapy, an hic and nunc approach identifying FDA-approved drugs with known safety profiles, is appealing. The preliminary in-vitro findings of this study warrant further in-vivo studies regarding these drugs. <br>Moreover, the biological mechanism underscored in this study could provide insights in the link between SARS-Cov2 viral infection and hyperinflammatory reaction as well as anti-viral effects. In particular, the Furin activity reduction by AZT may result in hindering SARS-CoV2 entry, as its Spike protein possess a novel Furin cleavage site.</p><p>Review by Jaime Mateus-Tique as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.29.008631";"2020-04-21";"01:30:56";"2020-04-21T01:30:56";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.29.008631v1";"008631"

MHV-a59 also has a furin-cleavage site at S1/S2. Binding of this virus to HS probably has a negative effect on entry, which can be overcome by PBS-DEAE. MHV/BHK does depend on HS for entry (PMID: 16254381). Its furin cleavage site at S1/S2 is no longer cleaved in the producer cell (similarly for FCoV ref 28, ref does not deal with IBV or MHV btw). So cleavage at the furin/multibasic cleavage site appears inversely correlated with HS binding. To what extent were the S proteins in this study processed by furin? Furthermore, binding to HS may not necessarily be helpfull for infection, as HS may probably also function as a  decoy receptor.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.041459";"2020-04-24";"22:25:46";"2020-04-24T22:25:46";"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041459v1";"041459"

Vaccine preparation (PiCoVacc) was generated from a viral strain (CN2) isolated from a COVID-19 patient and cultured on Vero cells during 10 passages, before being inactivated with Beta-propiolactone, an alkylating agent that damages nucleic acids and inhibits viral membrane fusion.<br>Balb/c mice and Wistar rats were injected at d0 and d7 with PiCoVacc (0, 1.5 or 3 or 6 ug per dose) and alum adjuvant. SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD specific IgG were detected after 1 week and continued to increase until the end of the study (week 6). Micro-neutralization assays showed a progressive augmentation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the strain used to make the PiCoVacc from week 1 to week 6. These antibodies (from week 3) also neutralized 9 others SARS-CoV-2 strains.<br>Next, rhesus macaques (n=4 per group) were immunized intramuscularly three times at d0, d7 and d14 with 0 (sham), 3ug (medium dose) or 6ug (high dose) of PiCoVacc with alum adjuvant, or only physiological saline. S-specific IgG and nAbs were measured at week 2 in both vaccinated groups. No fever or weight loss was observed after immunization. Biochemical blood tests, lymphocytes subset percent and cytokines showed no particular changed. Histopathological analysis of several organs (kidney, brain, liver, heart, spleen) did not show any changes either.<br>Macaques were then challenged by intra-tracheal inoculation of 106 TCID50 viral preparation of a different strain through the intra-tracheal route, 8 days after the third vaccine inoculation. All non-vaccinated controls showed important amount of viral RNA in pharynx, crissum and lung until day 7 post inoculation (dpi) and had severe interstitial pneumonia, whereas vaccinated macaques showed a quick decrease in throat viral loads and small histopathological changes in the lungs. Macaque vaccinated with the high dose had undetectable viral loads in lungs and anal swab at any point of the study. No Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) was observed.</p><p><b>Limitations</b><br>The macaques were challenge at the peak of the antibody response induced by the vaccine and no data was collected to assess the length of vaccine protection. Furthermore, the macaques were euthanized as early as seven days after the virus challenge and longer time of analysis will be required to evaluate potential immune-pathological effects of the vaccination and the dynamics of the infection in the different groups. Finally, the size of the study is very limited with 4 animals vaccinated per group. <br>While SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively stable, it would be interesting to test cross reactivity and protection with heterologous viruses, to confirm that the nAb induced by the vaccine can neutralize many other SARS-CoV-2 strains, as it was performed in the mice and rat studies. Indeed, although two different strains were used for the immunization and the challenge in rhesus macaques, the S protein sequences of those strains are identical, and the Genbank accession number to compare the rest of the sequence was not made available yet.<br>Furthermore, as most of COVID-19 severe patients are of advanced age, testing if this inactivated vaccine can also elicit antibody response in aged macaques would be of great interest.<br>The timing of vaccination and challenge is not clear with contradictory timelines indicated in the figures and main text. The authors do not describe the inactivation process of the virus enough, nor show any evidence of inactivation. More description and evidence of the inactivation (by showing that the virus does not grow in Vero cells nor in animals) is required to assess efficacy of vaccination<br><i>Finally, the resolution of the figures is really low and makes it hard to analyze<br></i></p><p><b>Significance</b><br>Development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is strongly needed as no effective treatment has been found yet. Among all the vaccine clinical trials already started2, this pre-clinical study shows that this inactivated vaccine could represent a good candidate for further development as it protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge without immediate side-effects. Although more pre-clinical data seem to be needed before starting human trials, this is the first study to our knowledge to show effectiveness in non-human primates. The biopharmaceutical firm, Sinovac, has registered phase I and II clinical trials 1. Moreover, the inactivation technique for vaccine development is well known and can be adapted for production in other facilities.</p><p><b>Credit</b><br><i>Reviewed by Emma Risson as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai.<br></i><br>1.

I think this is very solid evidence for cats getting this new virus, not just as an exception, but at a high rate in areas with an outbreak. Of course, it won't be that easy to detect an infection of a human by a cat, but it is known by now that humans can infect humans, cats can infect cats (experimentally via air droplets). It wouldn't surprise me if there is also apossible transmission from cat to human. There should be also tests in other areas in the world, especially with many cats, like in Spain, Italy, France. In addition, I suggest to test dogs in Oslo, Norway, where there was an outbreak of a ""mysterious dog's disease"" (CNN) last August, September 2019, with about 40 dogs dead and over 240 extremely sick.

Smoking increases circulating IL-6 levels, which in theory would increase TMPRSS2 expression via the AR (and likely explains the observed human results).  I strongly suspect TMPRSS2 expression in lung is primarily regulated by IL-6 in the presence of sufficient (non-castrate) androgen levels.  Moreover, all the high-risk groups for severe COVID-19 infection possess elevated IL-6 levels.  The mouse study desperately needs to be redone with exogenous IL-6 administration.

Atazanavir (ATV), an FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor with fewer side effects than liponavir (currently in COVID-19 clinical trial: NCT04307693), can reach lung tissue through intravenous administration and suggests functional improvement in pulmonary fibrosis patients. In this study, in vitro assays with VeroE6 and A549 cell lines demonstrate ATV’s binding specificity for and inhibitory action on Mpro. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have previously been shown to correlate with COVID-19 mortality, and measured levels were reduced in ATV-treated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, co-treatment with ATV and ritonavir prevented induction of IL-6 and TNF-a in monocytes, which was as good or better than chloroquine treatment. These data suggest it may be possible to repurpose ATV for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b></p><p>The study was performed entirely in vitro in VeroE6 and A549 cells. <br>Comparisons were done against chloroquine, a relatively toxic compound yet to demonstrate efficacy during in vivo testing1–3. Molecular docking stimulations are limited by previous data and training sets; while unlikely, there is a possibility that the binding properties modeled are not reflective of the true interactions.</p><p><b>Importance of findings:</b></p><p>This study identifies atazanavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, as an alternative to liponavir/ritonavir to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. A safer toxicity profile, localization to lung tissue, and demonstrated in vitro efficacy to reduce cell mortality markers and inflammatory markers in monocytes make the case that ATV is a potential candidate to prevent SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.</p><p><b>References</b><br>1.

Although in theory it is possible to do mutagenesis in vivo (if we think to CRISPR-CAS9 approaches), a similar approach is not sustainable and sufficiently quick with our current technology, for producing variants in all the main affected tissues. You have also to consider that our approaches based on CRISPR-cas9-like technology are able to change just one amino acid for each assay....and the approach needs to be better studied....You can find a recent review on the topic at this link:<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-018-04252-2%3AzgSSDoBGUdJBlCMk3wZOj6sgafA&amp;cuid=2634513"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04252-2"">https://www.nature.com/arti...</a> More importantly, it is better to use CRISPR-cas9 approaches for replacing amino acid responsible for impairing enzymes (typically observed in rare diseases or some cancers) aiming to re-introduce the working amino acid known for being present in the wild-type/native functional enzyme. Finally, you have to consider that ACE2 is just one of several receptors used by pathogens for entering our cells... ************************************************************* <br>Our ms instead shows that we can produce antibodies able to target the spike protein of this coronavirus (SARS.CoV.2) starting from previous known antibodies (designed against SARS.CoV.1) and mimicking ACE2 surface. We can mimic ACE2 surface, thx to the existence of a neutralizing antibody that binds the SARS.CoV.2 spike protein (at the level of the receptor binding domain, RBD) as described in Fig. 7 (see also Fig. 7 legend) at a site very close to the binding site of ACE2. In Fig. 6 (see also Fig. 6 legend) we describe the two antibodies known for being able to target at different positions SARS.CoV.1 spike RBD. Furthermore, in Fig. 8 we show variants that can be introduced in those antibodies for creating new neutralizing antibodies with higher affinity for SARS.CoV.2 spike RBD domain (See Fig. 8 and the corresponding legend), according to what reported in Table 3. ********************************************************************** <br>Coming back to your question, and based on our observations, you can imagine that you can administer the ACE2 recombinant (synthetic) protein (similar to what we do with insulin in diabetic patients, and similar to what described in references (68, 69)) for slowing down viral infections, allowing our immune cells to produce antibodies for killing the virus. Also based on our observations and 3D models, you can imagine that it would be possible to prepare a recombinant ACE2, with selected replaced residues for making its binding to Spike RBD more efficient than the binding observed for the native ACE2 present on our cell surface. Starting from the above cited interactions it would also be possible to build a diagnostic kit for estimating the presence of SARS.CoV.2 through their binding to the spike protein putatively present in asymptomatic people. Alternatively, you might use the single RBD domain (if correctly folded as in the native whole spike protein) instead of the entire spike protein trimer for creating a diagnostic kit able reveal the presence of high affinity antibodies directed against the RBD of the SARS.CoV.2 spike protein... <br>*********************************************************************** <br>Scientific research may lead to several good solutions. and we need to believe in and trust scientific research. Nevertheless, we have not to forget (above all our politicians must remember) that we need dedicated space and funding resources for continuing to do good science!! I hope that your question was addressed in full.

The transcriptomics also map TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and ST14 protease gene expression across mature enterocytes and other enteric cells. They additionally show ACE2 protein localizing to the brush border of the intestinal epithelium. <br>- Researchers use VSV chimera reporter virus with SARS-CoV-2 S protein to assay viral tropism in culture and demonstrate active replication in human duodenal enteroids as well as apical mature enterocytes (ACE2+) in monolayer system. <br>- Used HEK293 with ectopic expression of proteases to show that TMPRSS2 or <br>TMPRSS4 co-expression with ACE2 enhanced viral infectivity by enhancing endocytosis. CRISPR-Cas9 based deletion or pharmacological inhibition of TMPRSS proteases in human primary enteroids limited viral replication, more so upon TMPRSS4 deletion. <br>- Further, a co-culture system designed with ACE2/TMPRSS2/4 expressing host cells and S-protein expressing donor cells, to mimic enteroid cell population interactions. Importantly found that TMPRSS2 can influence viral entry <i>in trans</i> through paracrine interaction, unlike TMPRSS4 that functions <i>in cis</i>. <br>- SARS-CoV-2 chimera virus were very unstable in colonic fluids, compared to rotaviruses that were stable in gastric and colonic fluids. Supporting these data, CoVID-19 patient fecal sample analysis also consistently showed viral RNA load, but no infectious particles.</p><p><u>Limitations </u><br>- The studies use pseudotyped-VSV reporter virus instead of WT virus, which could potentially have an impact on tropism. It will be important to replicate some of the <br>co-culture studies using active SARS-CoV-2 virus as confirmation. Similarly, ectopic expression and co-culture experiments can be strengthened by replicating studies in primary cells.  <br>- Study mentions lack of infectious particle in fecal samples, but no conclusive data presented to support this important point.</p><p><u>Significance </u><br>- TMPRSS4 important for influenza virus tropism, but not previously shown to be important in CoV-2 infectivity in the gut context.  <br>- Co-culture experiments imply that paracrine interaction of TMPRSS2 (from goblet cells for example) on neighboring TMPRSS4/ACE2 expressing enteric cells can drive synergistic increase in viral infectivity in gut epithelia. Whether such gene expression distribution and protein interactions exist in other tissue contexts (lung, kidney) remains to be seen.  <br>- Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been broadly observed,<br> but intestinal infection of ACE2++ cells has been reported clinically; <br>this study reconciles these paradoxical observations by demonstrating <br>that despite active infection and replication in enterocytes the virus <br>might not remain intact in colonic fluids.

"17570";"4896544595";"sinaiimmunologyreviewproject";"Sinai Immunol Review Project";"<p><u>Main findings</u><br>In this report, the authors provide an evaluation of available animal models, based on their ability to recapitulate characteristics of COVID-19 as seen in humans. As of now, both non-human primate models and transgenic hACE2 mice have limitations. An immediate type I IFN response, for one, has been notable in these models, even though the dysregulated inflammatory response seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is significant in its delayed IFN response.</p><p>Here, the authors describe the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and viral load in wild-type (WT), Ifnar1-/-, and Il28r-/- C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that wild-type mice that do not bear the human ACE2 receptor can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, ""although inefficiently and likely transiently."" Comparison with mice without the type I IFN receptor and the type III IFN receptor showed that all strains presented with a mild lung pathology that did not resemble COVID-19 bronchopneumonia; notably, though, Ifnar1-/- mice did present with increased levels of inflammatory infiltration, compared to the WT strain, suggesting that the active and functional IFN response in WT mice restricts pathogenesis. Hence, the disease is not fully replicable in mice.</p><p>The authors then propose that Syrian hamsters may be a better model, given previous reports that they are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. WT, STAT2-/- (loss of type I and III IFN signaling), and Il28r-/- (loss of type III IFN signaling) hamsters were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. WT hamsters carried high viral loads and infectious titers in the lungs, and histological analysis revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis, massive immune infiltration, and edema. These findings reflect the histopathological characteristics of human bronchopneumonia seen in COVID-19.</p><p>Interestingly, while viral RNA levels were not significantly different in the lungs of these hamsters, titers of infectious virus in the lung and viremia were highest in the STAT2-/- hamsters, which suggests STAT2 plays a role in deterring viral dissemination. In fact, these hamsters had the highest levels of viral RNA in the spleen, liver, and upper and lower GI tracts. Still, Il28r-/- hamsters exhibited bronchopneumonia and lung inflammation, actually to a greater extent than STAT2-/- hamsters, suggesting that type III IFN indeed plays an important, protective role in restricting pathogenesis and the inclusion of a type I IFN exacerbates bronchopneumonia. Though, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-ɣ were not remarkably high in the serum of infected hamsters, IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in the lungs of infected STAT2-/- and Il28r-/- hamsters.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br>Without comparing the aforementioned three murine strains to a transgenic hACE2 mouse strain as a ""control"", it is difficult to properly assess the significance of viral replication and load in the non-transgenic mice. A similar limitation can be identified in the experiments involving the Syrian hamsters. A transgenic model with hamsters would provide additional evidence to suggest that viral replication in these animals in the absence of a human version of the ACE2 receptor is not happenstance and is truly sufficient to reflect COVID-19 disease. Or, alternatively, a transient knockout of the ACE2 receptor in hamsters before challenging them with SARS-CoV-2 to assess for signs of reduced viral infection may be appropriate.</p><p>Another experiment that is absent in this study is the use of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 components required for viral entry as a means of immunizing Syrian hamsters before challenging them with the virus. This, followed by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry for ACE2-expressing cells, would provide further validity to the concept of SARS-CoV-2 actually invading and replicating inside ACE2+ cells in Syrian hamsters, which has been described for SARS-CoV-1, but not yet for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p><u>Significance</u><br>Ongoing studies have identified notable limitations to the use of mice to recapitulate human COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lung pathology is not significant. Moreover, viral dissemination to extrapulmonary organs, including the GI tract or the liver, and viremia are not observed. Therefore, to address this unmet need for an improved animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the present study proposed the use of golden Syrian hamsters, which have been previously described to better reflect SARS-CoV-1 infection than mice. The histopathological findings do provide convincing evidence to suggest that these animals may indeed be superior than mice to also study SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, but the role of STAT2 - as suggested by the experiments involving Syrian hamsters - remains to be further elucidated. The precise cellular mechanism for viral dissemination throughout the vasculature and to other peripheral organs is not clear, so the supposed dual impact of STAT2 deletion in mice or in hamsters is still phenotypic observation.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Matthew D.

ACE2 receptor was highly expressed in cholangiocyte-biased liver progenitors (EPCAM+) which also had a high expression for TROP2 gene. TMPRSS2 was expressed by both TROP2high and TROP2int liver cells. The authors reported that these cholangiocyte-biased progenitor cells had a high expression of TROP2 that correlated with high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in liver.

Of those, 944 belong to viruses that infect humans, including both viruses with low CFR (NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1) and those with high CFR (MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). The full genomes of these coronaviruses were aligned to detect high-confidence genomic features that were predictive of the high-CFR. Eleven regions were detected in total, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the spike (S) glycoprotein were significantly enriched with those predictive regions. Further analysis revealed that 4 out of 11 differences identified were reflected in the protein alignment, 3 of which resided in the N phosphoprotein and one in the S glycoprotein. The deletions and insertions found in N proteins mapped to monopartite nuclear localization signals (NLS), one bipartite NLS and a nuclear export signal (NES). They resulted in the accumulation of positive charges in the monopartite NLS, bipartite NLS and NES of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, whereas in MERS-CoV, positive charges accumulated primarily in the first of the two monopartite NLS. The accumulation of positive charges is known to result in the enhancement of these signals, thus implying that the localization pattern of the N proteins differs between high-CFR and low-CFR strains, and this may be a factor contributing to the increased pathogenicity of high-CFR strains. The analysis of S protein revealed a unique 4 amino acid insertion upstream of the heptad repeat region in all high-CFR viruses but not in any of the low-CFR ones. The structural analysis of SARS-CoV confirmed that this insertion increased the length and flexibility of the region connecting the fusion peptide and the first heptad repeat, likely affecting the membrane fusion process of the high-CFR coronaviruses. <br>By the alignment of all 3001 collected coronavirus strain sequences, they also identified a unique insert in the RBD and the RBM in the cases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and within the subdomain that binds to DPP4 in the case of MERS-CoV. This unique insert was also found in the most proximal zoonotic strains before the zoonotic strains jumped to human. The unique insertions occurred independently in three high-CFR strains and resulted in a larger hydrophobic surface and additional interactions, which might contribute not only to the zoonotic transmission of the high-CFR CoV strains to humans but also their high CFR.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study:  </u><br>This study provides predictions on unique sequences present in coronaviruses of high pathogenicity, and in highly related zoonotic species. Functional analysis of the unique elements is not carried out. <br>There is an inconsistency related to description of positive/negative charged proteins between figure legends of 2 and 3, and the main text.<br><u>The importance and implications for the current epidemics:</u><br>The identification of unique sequences presents in the high-CFR but not in the low-CFR human coronaviruses can be experimentally tested to investigate the importance of each unique motive in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of human coronaviruses.
