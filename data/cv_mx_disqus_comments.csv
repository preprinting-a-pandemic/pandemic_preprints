The uncertainty of estimates of incubation rate and other intervals provided in the abstract is likely greater then what is reported, the numbers thus should be treated with caution. Only cases outside of Wuhan up to January 24th 2020 are included (31 - 43 cases are available for the individual subanalyses).</p><p>This review has been crossposted on pubPeer, medRxiv, <a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprereview.org%3AEFW5IcAVRLUx5WtMZE-vOptQgvU&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""prereview.org"">prereview.org</a>.</p><p><i><b>Disclaimer:</b> I lack background in epidemiology to let me evaluate whether the proposed modelling approach is a standard one, if much better tools are available or if there are possible issues with the underlying data. In the following, I therefore focus primarily on the statistical aspects of the method employed, without considering alternative approaches.<br></i></p><p><b>The big picture:</b><br>The main idea of the preprint is to use cases of 2019-nCoV reported in patients that spent only a short time in Wuhan to estimate incubation rate. The underlying assumption is that those patients could have been exposed to the virus only during their stay in Wuhan.</p><p><b>Strengths:</b><br>The approach is interesting in that it removes the need to directly guess when/how the patients got into contact with the virus. It is also conceptually simple and requires few additional assumptions.</p><p>I  find it great that multiple models for the time intervals are tested and reported. The fact that the models mostly agree increases my confidence in the results.</p><p>I further congratulate the authors on being able to put the analysis together very quickly and provide a clear and concise manuscript. I am thankful they posted their results publicly as soon as possible.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b><br>The main disadvantage of the chosen approach is that it let's the authors to only use a fraction of the reported cases and that the approach is only valid on data from the early phase of the epidemic. Once more cases happen outside Wuhan, the number patients who have become infected elsewhere will increase and the approach of this preprint will no longer be applicable. This is however not strongly detrimental to the manuscript and it could hopefully serve as one of many approaches to estimate the characteristics of 2019-nCoV, each with its own strenghts and limitations.</p><p>There are however some specific points I find problematic in the manuscript.</p><p>1) Using AIC for model selection might be brittle, especially since the differences in AIC are very small and the AIC itself is a noisy measure. Using some sort of model averaging and/or stacking would likely be beneficial.</p><p>2) Also, no explicit effort to verify that the models used are appropriate has been reported. A simple model check would be to overlay the actual data over Figure 1 (e.g. the empirical CDF produced assuming both exposure and onset happend in the middle of the interval). Similar effort could be useful for Figure 2.</p><p>3) Taking 1 and 2 together implies there is substantial uncertainty about which model is the best. Further, no strong guarantees that at least one of the proposed models is appropriate were given. The uncertainty bounds computed using only the ""best fit"" model are therefore certainly overly optimistic as they ignore this uncertainty. While this is challenging to account for mathematically, I believe it should be reported prominently in the manuscript to avoid confusion.</p><p>4) While using only visitors to Wuhan makes sense to estimate the incubation period, the estimates of time from illness onset to hospitalization and/or death would likely benefit from including all cases. I don't see why only using cases outside of Wuhan for these other estimates is beneficial. I can however see why incubation period might be the primary focus of the paper and therefore a dataset with cases in Wuhan was not constructed.</p><p>5) For some reason the link to supplementary data is broken (probably not author's fault), so I cannot investigate the dataset. Code is also not available so it is hard to judge the modelling approach in detail.<br>I have contacted the authors and will update this review if I receive that data and/or code.</p><p>The only issue I feel strongly about in this manuscript is with the abstract, which should IMHO clearly state that only a small number of cases has been used and that the uncertainty is likely larger than what was computed. Otherwise the paper seems to be a good contribution to the global effort to understand 2019-nCoV.</p>";"10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754";"2020-02-02";"15:58:08";"2020-02-02T15:58:08";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754v1";"2020.01.26.20018754"

Another group showed SARS survived 5 days on stainless steel. We and others also showed flu survives several days. Implications are that in a closed environment a potentially infectious aerosol of small particle size can remain suspended in air for some time before landing on surfaces – hence being outdoors or opening windows is probably a good thing. It might question whether the 2 metre gap between people is sufficient in a confined space. As I have said before, survival of coronaviruses for days on touch surfaces (not the 2 hours cited by some advisers) is a hygiene risk, and it is difficult to avoid touching door handles, stair rails, public touch screens etc. It re-emphasises the need for good personal hygiene such as washing hands rigorously throughout the day, or using an alcohol hand gel, and avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth.</p><p>Because this is a pre-print it is difficult to know exactly what they have done. Clearly they are using a different virus and culturing in Vero-E6 kidney cells while we used MRC-5 lung cells. An important difference may be that in their 2003 MERS paper they used 100ul culture onto unspecified size surfaces (“washers”) –McMaster-Carr, USA); for the new paper where they say they used 50ul of virus then we know that this can take a long time to dry out. Copper alloys kill bacteria and viruses when dry due to the inactivation mechanisms we have published. Our method to simulate hand contact uses 20ul onto 1 square cm, spread over the surface and then dries out in several minutes; sometimes we use 1ul when we have high concentrations of pathogen available.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, our cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 1mM GlutaMax-1*, nonessential amino acids, and 5% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. Their cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (Logan), 1 mM L-glutamine (Lonza), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco).</p><p>*(GlutaMAX™-1 (Gibco), L-alanyl-L-glutamine, is a dipeptide substitute for L-glutamine. GlutaMAX™-1 can be used as a direct substitute for L-glutamine at equimolar concentrations in both adherent and suspension mammalian cell cultures with minimal or no adaptation. GlutaMAX™-1 is highly soluble, heat-stable, and improves growth efficiency and performance of mammalian cell culture systems. GlutaMAX™-1 eliminates problems associated with thespontaneous breakdown of L-glutamine into ammonia during incubation, allowing for longer lasting cultures. )</p><p>Importantly, glutamine binds copper while it also spontaneously breakdowns at physiological pH to ammonia which reacts with copper to precipitate light blue Cu(OH)2. This would give a partial passivation effect, making the copper surfaces less antiviral while our GlutaMAX-1 would not; hence explaining their longer time for copper inactivation.</p><p>This is one of the reasons we decided GlutaMAX-1 was the better option to avoid subsequent potential copper binding problems in the surface contact experiments.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217";"2020-03-16";"16:32:43";"2020-03-16T16:32:43";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2";"2020.03.09.20033217"

I have a few questions, the answer to which might make it even more valuable and better able to evaluate the rates of transmission as an effect of age. I take these mostly from carefully table 3 and table 1, but also from the 'transmission characteristics' subsection of the results section.</p><p>Of the 1298 close contacts, it appears only 1155 actually had tests come back.</p><p>There is evidently substantial overlap between the household (HH) contacts and the meal contacts, which makes sense. Certainly the travel contacts in general are coming back much lower. The question is, where do the age groups stratify within these. I would imagine by far the close contacts with 0-9 and 10-19 are much more likely in the HH, as well as the ""often"" category"" of contact frequency, as there is a much less likelihood of having co-travel and co-non household meals with kids for the substantial majority of your initial cases (except for maybe the 4 who were kids). I suspect this may skew the conclusion that the rates of transmission for these two younger age groups are similar to older groups. I suspect likewise that the substantial portion of the travel negatives are with older age groups. I think performing the age analysis, or at least presenting the data, for each age group for the HH, travel, meal, and contact frequency subgroups would be helpful. I am aware that the n for some of these subgroups might be too low to allow for a real analysis, but then that is part of my point...<br>Also, there is a substantial gender difference in those infect among close contacts, with females having a far greater % infection rate (almost double!). Similarly to the age effects, stratifying this gender ratio by age as well as close contact type would be of benefit.</p><p> I hope you find my comments constructive and can address them.

I am not a virologist, but I understand that just because SARA-CoV-2 can be aerosilized in similar systems that you used in your paper, that it may not mean there is clinical aerosolization and viral spread. While you touch on this in the paper and state that it is ""plausible"" that aerosol may contribute to spread, I think there needs to be more nuance to this discussion as to how likely this may be. To my understanding there are notable cases where in vitro systems such as the one in this study have found steady viral aerosols, but clinical aerosolization was not significant enough to present a means of viral spread (i.e. ebola).</p><p>I think discussing the topic of aerosolization in more detail are especially important for this paper during this time period -- one where many non-virologists and laypeople are reading high-brow virology literature.

It still needs to go through peer-review, etc., to be published.</p><p>That said, if this research is borne out/validated then this is pretty problematic news. The Chinese Government gave an R0 value of 2.6-2.9 or something like that, and also has publicly said the mortality rate is similar to the 2006 SARS outbreak (which had a lower R0 of something like 1.9 or something (possibly lower) ultimately. Assuming these figures are more accurate, If the Chinese Government is either not finding or hiding the number of cases but not the number of deaths, it actually may be good news, as the mortality rate would be considerably lower. However if they are wrong about or lying about both figures and it is both more contagious and more deadly, this could be a pretty serious epidemic/pandemic. If they, for instance are underestimating or underreporting the mortality rate by about .5 deaths per 1000 (I believe that’s the metric I’ve seen), the mortality rate would be roughly that of the 1918 Spanish Flu. Now, we are far better at treating symptoms now and preventing person to person spread of disease as we were in 1918, as well as developing vaccines. We have a lot of developed treatments that could be effective in minimizing symptoms or fighting the disease as well, even short of a currently viable cure/particularly effective treatment.<br>However, that R0 value, if anywhere close to on target is pretty alarming. Even if the actual value is halfway between China’s figures and this study’s figures, and even if it were merely as deadly as SARS was.</p><p>Still, this isn’t an official figure yet. This isn’t even published, we don’t know how much other research will validate this number or contest it. So don’t panic based on a pre-print article. This probably has more value being available for other researchers, whom seeing other people’s figures, or methodology could benefit in their own research or methodology, and public heath officials who need to try to assess what a worst case scenario may look like. If these figures are accurate, they would be alarming. Even somebody who can read statistics and the language correctly in shouldn’t simply take something like this as fact, until it gets through peer review, other experts evaluate it once it’s published, and other figures start to align with their findings. I engaged in speculation, as it is really concerning should these figures be correct, and an interesting conversation to engage in. However, I am not credentialed in epidemiology, public health, or medicine. You should listen to experts and public health officials, over then speculation of somebody like myself.

Most importantly, the timings of the clinical measurements are not described relative to the disease course, so it is unclear if the differences between ‘severe’ and ‘non-severe’ infections are occurring before progression to severe disease (which would make them useful prognostic markers), or after (which would not).</p><p>This paper among many retrospective studies coming from hospitals around the world treating individuals with COVID-19. In this case, largely because of the sparse description of the study design, this paper offers little new information. However, studies like this could be very valuable and we would strongly encourage the authors to revise this manuscript to include more information about the timeline of clinical measurements in relation to disease onset and more details of patient outcomes.</p><p>This review was undertaken as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906";"2020-03-20";"22:45:31";"2020-03-20T22:45:31";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031906v1";"2020.03.05.20031906"

The authors identify a population of abnormally large (FSC-hi) monocytes, present in COVID19 patients, but absent in PBMCs of healthy volunteers (n=16) or  patients with different infections (AIDS, malaria, TB). This FSC-hi monocytic population contains classical, intermediate and non-classical (monocytes (based on CD14 and CD16 expression) that produce inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF and IL-10). The authors suggest an association of FSC-hi monocytes with poor outcome and correlate a high percentage of FSC-low monocytes, or higher ratio of FSC-low/hi monocytes, with faster hospital discharge.</p><p><b>LIMITATIONS</b>: While identification of the monocytic population based on FSC is rather robust, the characterization of these cells remains weak. A comprehensive comparison of FSC-hi monocytes with FSC-low monocytes from patients and healthy controls would be of high value. It is unclear if percentages in blood are among CD45+ cells. Furthermore, it would have been important to include absolute numbers of different monocytic populations (in table 1 there are not enough samples and it is unclear what the authors show).<br>The authors show expression of the ACE2 receptor on the surface of the monocytes, and highlight these cells as potential targets of SARS-Cov2. However, appropriate controls are needed. CD16 has high affinity to rabbit IgG and it is unclear whether the authors considered unspecific binding of rabbit anti-ACE2  to Fc receptors. Gene expression of ACE-2 on monocytes needs to be assessed. Furthermore, it would be important to confirm infection of monocytes by presence of viral proteins or viral  particles by microscopy.<br>Considering the predictive role of FSC-hi monocytes on the development of the disease and its severity, some data expected at this level are neither present nor addressed. Although the cohort is small, it does include 3 ICU patients. What about their ratio of FSC-low vs FSC-hi monocytes in comparison to other patients? Was this apparent early in the disease course? Does this population of FSC-hi monocytes differ between ICU patients and others in terms of frequency, phenotype or cytokine secretion? <br>In general, figures need to revised to make the data clear. For example, in Fig. 5, according to the legend it seems that patients with FSC-high monocytes are discharged faster from the hospital. However according to description in the text, patients were grouped in high or low levels of FSC-low monocytes.</p><p><b>RELEVANCE</b> : Despite the limitations of this study, the discovery of a FSC-high monocyte population in COVID-19 patients is of great interest. With similar implication, a the recent study by Zhou et al (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biorxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.02.12.945576v1%29%3Aod7q3vMw8WeCsCYZ0_-erRUAVwU&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945576v1)"">https://www.biorxiv.org/con...</a> identified a connection between an inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocyte population and pulmonary immunopathology leading to deleterious clinical manifestations and even acute mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Using flow cytometry of circulating PBMC, the authors found that the total lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients was slightly reduced. This is in striking contrast to severe patients in which severe lymphopenia is common and correlates with severity of disease. The relative CD19 cell count including particularly Germinal Center B cell (GCB) counts were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients. With respect to T cells, the authors describe no substantial differences in CD4 and CD8 T cell counts. However, when analyzing T cell subsets, the authors discovered significantly increased expression of CD25 and PD-1 as markers of late activation and exhaustion in CD8+ T cells, respectively. Moreover, the amount of naïve CD4 T cells as well as of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients.</p><p>In an attempt to find correlations between patient characteristics and the status of the adaptive immune system, the authors applied Person’s correlation coefficient and found no major impact of age on CD8+ T cell activation as well as on Tfh and GCB-like T cell differentiation.</p><p>Summing up, the authors performed a thorough phenotypic analysis of B and T cell subsets in COVID-19 patients giving a promising insight into the status of the adaptive immune system in their patient cohort with mild symptoms.</p><p><u>Critical analysis:</u><br>The strength of this study is the in-depth multiparameter analysis of adaptive immune cells in a reasonably sized cohort of 38 patients and 18 healthy controls. The assumption that COVID-19 patients with mild disease show an appropriate antigen-specific response due to an increase of Tfh and GCB cells is justified by the data.</p><p><u>Implications of the findings in the context of current epidemics:</u><br>The study clearly shows that patients with mild-disease have increased Tfh and GCB and understanding the specificity of this response and how they correlate with disease course will be interesting to explore.

Age ≥ 18 years<br>2.	Positive diagnosis COVID-19 by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR<br>3.	Diagnosis of pneumonia on chest CT <br>4.

Mild ARDS has a PaO2/FIO2 of 200-300 mmHg, moderate is <br>100-200, and severe &lt; 100.<br>5.	Willing to receive a random assignment to any designated treatment group; not participating in another study at the same time</p><p><b>Exclusion criteria</b>: <br>1. Severe or critical respiratory illness (not explicitly defined, <br>presumed to be respiratory function worse than outlined in inclusion <br>criteria); or participation in trial does not meet patient’s maximum <br>benefit or safe follow up criteria<br>2.	Retinopathy or other retinal diseases<br>3.	Conduction block or other arrhythmias<br>4.	Severe liver disease, defined by Child-Pugh score ≥ C or AST &gt; twice the upper limit<br>5.	Pregnant or breastfeeding<br>6.	Severe renal failure, defined by eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, or on dialysis<br>7.	Potential transfer to another hospital within 72h of enrollment<br>8.	Received any trial treatment for COVID-19 within 30 days before the current study</p><p>All patients received the standard of care: oxygen therapy, antiviral <br>agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin, with or without <br>corticosteroids. Patients in the HCQ treatment group received additional<br> oral HCQ 400 mg/day, given as 200 mg 2x/day. HCQ was administered from <br>days 1-5 of the trial. The primary endpoint was 5 days post enrollment <br>or a severe adverse reaction to HCQ. The primary outcome evaluated was <br>time to clinical recovery (TTCR), defined as return to normal body <br>temperature and cough cessation for &gt; 72h. Chest CT were imaged on <br>days 0 and 6 of the trial for both groups; body temperature and patient <br>reports of cough were collected 3x/day from day 0 – 6. The mean age and <br>sex distribution between the HCQ and control arms were comparable.</p><p><b>Findings</b><br>There were 2 patients showing mild secondary effects of HCQ treatment. More <br>importantly, while 4 patients in the control group progressed to severe <br>disease, none progressed in the treatment group.<br>TTCR was significantly decreased in the HCQ treatment arm; recovery from fever <br>was shortened by one day (3.2 days control vs. 2.2 days HCQ, p = <br>0.0008); time to cessation of cough was similarly reduced (3.1 days <br>control vs. 2.0 days HCQ, p = 0.0016).<br>Overall, it appears that HCQ treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 has a modest effect on clinical recovery (symptom relief on average 1 day earlier) but may be more <br>potent in reducing the progression from mild to severe disease.</p><p><b>Study Limitations </b><br>This study is limited in its inclusion of only patients with mild disease, <br>and exclusion of those on any treatment other than the standard of care.<br> It would also have been important to include the laboratory values of <br>positive RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 to compare the baseline and <br>evolution of the patients’ viral load.</p><p><b>Significance</b><br>Despite its limitations, the study design has good rigor as a double blind RCT <br>and consistent symptom checks on each day of the trail. Now that the FDA<br> has approved HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 in the USA, this study <br>supports the efficacy of HCQ use early in treatment of patients showing <br>mild symptoms, to improve time to clinical recovery, and possibly reduce<br> disease progression. However, most of the current applications of HCQ <br>have been in patients with severe disease and for compassionate use, <br>which are out of the scope of the findings presented in this trial. <br>Several additional clinical trials to examine hydroxychloroquine are now<br> undergoing; their results will be critical to further validate these <br>findings.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Rachel Levantovsky as a part of a project<br> by students, postdocs and faculty in the Immunology Institute at the <br>Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758";"2020-04-01";"16:34:11";"2020-04-01T16:34:11";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v2";"2020.03.22.20040758"

In accordance with other studies, age and hypertension were risk factors for disease severity, and lymphopenia and increased IL-6 was observed in severe patients.  The authors show that fasting blood glucose (FBG) was altered and patients with severe disease were often hyperglycemic. Data presented support that hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, and reduction in high-densitylipoprotein (HDL-C) and ApoA1 were associated with disease severity.  </p><p><b>Limitations:</b>  In this study non-severe patients were divided in two groups based on average course of the disease: mild group1 (14 days, n=28) and mild group 2 (30 days, n=44). However mild patients with a longer disease course did not show an intermediate phenotype (between mild patients with shorter disease course and severe patients), hence it is unclear whether this was a useful and how it impacted the analysis. Furthermore, the non-exclusion of co-morbidity factors in the analysis may bias the results (e.g. diabetic patients and glucose tests) It is not clear at what point in time the laboratory parameters are sampled. In table 3, it would have been interesting to explore a multivariate multiple regression. The correlation lacks of positive control to assess the specificity of the correlation to the disease vs. correlation in any inflammatory case. The dynamic study assessing the predictability of the laboratory parameter is limited to 2 patients.  Hence there are several associations with disease severity, but larger studies are necessary to test the independent predictive value of these potential biomarkers. </p><p><b>Findings implications: </b> As hospital are getting overwhelmed a set of easily accessible laboratory indicators (such as serum total protein) would potentially provide a triage methodology between potentially severe cases and mild ones.

All patients (mean age=69.22 years) had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and their median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Most patients were older male (70% male) with co-morbidities and only 11 % were smokers. 75% patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Many patients had chronic diseases, including hypertension (58.33%). cardiovascular disease (22.22%) and diabetes (19.44%). Typical clinical feature measured in these patients includes lymphopenia and elevated markers of inflammation.</p><p>Limitations: As noted by the authors, the conclusions of this study are very limited because this is single-centered study focusing on a small cohort of patients who did not survive.

Countries that never implement BCG vaccination have a higher mortality rate than countries which have a BCG vaccination policy (16.38 deaths per million people vs 0.78). Next, the authors show that an earlier start of vaccination correlates with a lower number of deaths per million inhabitants. They interpret this as the vaccine protecting a larger fraction of elderly people, which are usually more affected by COVID-19. Moreover, higher number of COVID-19 cases were presented in countries that never implemented a universal BCG vaccination policy.</p><p><b>Limitations:<br></b>While this study aims to test an intriguing hypothesis unfortunately, the data is not sufficient at this time to accurately make any determinations. Several caveats must be noted including: not all countries are in the same stage of the pandemic, the number of cases/deaths is still changing very rapidly in a lot of countries and thus the association may only reflect exposure to the virus. This analysis would need to be re-evaluated when all the countries are passed the pandemic and more accurate numbers are available. Additionally, very few middle and high-income countries ever implemented universal BCG vaccination, which can be a source of bias (5 countries, vs 55 that have a BCG vaccine policy). Effective screening and social isolation policies also varied considerable across the countries tested and may reflect another important confounder. The authors could consider analyzing the Case Fatality Rate (CFR, % of patients with COVID-19 that die), to more correct for exposure although testing availability will still bias this result.  Variability in mortality within countries or cities with variable vaccination and similar exposure could also be appropriate although confounders will still be present.</p><p><b>Relevance:<br></b>BCG vaccine is a live attenuated strain derived from Mycobacterium bovis and used for a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB). This vaccine has been proven to be efficient in preventing childhood meningitis TB, but doesn’t prevent adult TB as efficiently. For this reason, several countries are now only recommending this vaccine for at-risk population only.<br>This study shows that there is a correlation between BCG vaccination policy and reduced mortality for Covid-19. Indeed, BCG vaccine has been shown to protect against several viruses and enhance innate immunity1, which could explain why it could protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. Moreover, the efficiency of adult/older people vaccination and protection against Covid-19 still needs to be assessed. Regarding this, Australian researchers are starting a clinical trial of BCG vaccine for healthcare workers2, to assess if it can protect them against Covid-19.</p><p>1.

I disagree with it for several reasons:<br>The paper from Wallinga estimates age-specific contact matrices for contacts for RESPIRATORY diseases, it is not for influenza only. Indeed, for any respiratory disease, the contact is defined in the same way. COVID-19 and influenza are both respiratory diseases, and as such, they share the same definition of what a contact is, and what an infectious contact would be. So it is perfectly valid to use it. Furthermore, while children are only showing mild symptoms of COVID-19, that doesn't mean they are not transmitting the disease. In fact, this paper shows that they get infected at the same rate as other age groups (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.03.03.20028423v3%29%3A6Ea8YzroARoXd7cvw0wZHTpcN0E&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v3)"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a>. <br>Finally, the paper doesn't show that isolating children has the biggest impact, it shows that it has a considerable impact, as they are definitely part of the chain of transmission.

This yet was in a Twitter thread involving an excited discussion about the extent to which the UK government was lying in its announcement, and repeated assertion today, that there is a delay in the supply and distribution of covid19 tests due to the lack of reaction agents available in the supply chain for the test. Whether or not this is the case, or is part of a deliberate govt policy to allow the virus to spread and to reach 'herd immunity' is a matter of heated debate, but not necessarily of concern to you. However, should your simple pre-heating method be proven effective and reliable, it would clearly be a game-changer.

I would like to make the following points: <br>Overall, the evidence<br>presented certainly raises concern about the ability of COVID-19 to infect the kidney.<br>However, the implications of this finding are such that more rigorous immunohistochemistry<br>controls are very desirable. Normal kidney and renal sections form unrelated<br>autopsies showed no antibody staining, but it would be important to rule out non-specific<br>staining in damaged tissue. I have personally seen such non-specific staining<br>with C5b-9 antibodies. Therefore, negative controls should include tissues with<br>acute tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis not related to COVID-19</p><p>Electron microscopy can<br>certainly be done on paraffin embedded tissue, since viruses survive formalin fixation<br>quite well. That would make the case watertight and provide really convincing<br>evidence that COVID-19 can infect tubular epithelium.<br>To further define the<br>spectrum of renal injury in COVID-19 infection, the cases with proteuria reported<br>in this draft manuscript should undergo systematic urine sediment examination<br>with special reference to presence of inflammatory debris, casts, viral cytopathic<br>effect and ultrastructural evidence of viral particles.<br>Even if renal infection is further<br>confirmed, one should keep in mind that the kidney pathology presented may only<br>occur in a minority of patients with very severe infection. Renal dysfunction<br>in the setting of viral pneumonia can be due to pre-renal factors, medications,<br>cardiac-renal syndrome, and other comorbidities. The risk of transmission of COVID-19<br>from an unrecognized infected donor to a recipient may be much lower via kidney<br>compared to  lung transplantation.<br>Further research is needed to quantify that risk in numeric terms and come up<br>with more precise risk estimates of COVID-19 transmission via organ transplantation.<br>Parmjeet Randhawa,<br>Professor of Pathology,<br>Division of Transplantation Pathology, <br>University of Pittsburgh and The Thomas E Starzl<br>Transplantation Institute, <br>Pittsburgh, PA, USA</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120";"2020-03-31";"16:51:49";"2020-03-31T16:51:49";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.20031120v3";"2020.03.04.20031120"

From February 4 – February 28, 2020 142 COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. 62 patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in a double blind, randomized control trial, with 31 patients in each arm.</p><p><u>Inclusion criteria:</u><br>1.	Age ≥ 18 years<br>2.	Positive diagnosis COVID-19 by detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR<br>3.	Diagnosis of pneumonia on chest CT <br>4.	Mild respiratory illness, defined by SaO2/SPO2 ratio &gt; 93% or PaO2/FIO2 ratio &gt; 300 mmHg in hospital room conditions (Note: relevant clinical references described below.)<br></p><blockquote>a.	Hypoxia is defined as an SpO2 of 85-94%; severe hypoxia &lt; 85%. <br>b.	The PaO2/FIO2 (ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen) is used to classify the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mild ARDS has a PaO2/FIO2 of 200-300 mmHg, moderate is 100-200, and severe &lt; 100.</blockquote><p><br>5.	Willing to receive a random assignment to any designated treatment group; not participating in another study at the same time</p><p><u>Exclusion criteria: </u><br>1.	Severe or critical respiratory illness (not explicitly defined, presumed to be respiratory function worse than outlined in inclusion criteria); or participation in trial does not meet patient’s maximum benefit or safe follow up criteria<br>2.	Retinopathy or other retinal diseases<br>3.	Conduction block or other arrhythmias<br>4.	Severe liver disease, defined by Child-Pugh score ≥ C or AST &gt; twice the upper limit<br>5.	Pregnant or breastfeeding<br>6.	Severe renal failure, defined by eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73m2, or on dialysis<br>7.	Potential transfer to another hospital within 72h of enrollment<br>8.	Received any trial treatment for COVID-19 within 30 days before the current study</p><p>All patients received the standard of care: oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin, with or without corticosteroids. Patients in the HCQ treatment group received additional oral HCQ 400 mg/day, given as 200 mg 2x/day. HCQ was administered from days 1-5 of the trial. The primary endpoint was 5 days post enrollment or a severe adverse reaction to HCQ. The primary outcome evaluated was time to clinical recovery (TTCR), defined as return to normal body temperature and cough cessation for &gt; 72h. Chest CT were imaged on days 0 and 6 of the trial for both groups; body temperature and patient reports of cough were collected 3x/day from day 0 – 6. The mean age and sex distribution between the HCQ and control arms were comparable.</p><p><b>Findings</b></p><p>There were 2 patients showing mild secondary effects of HCQ treatment. More importantly, while 4 patients in the control group progressed to severe disease, none progressed in the treatment group.<br>TTCR was significantly decreased in the HCQ treatment arm; recovery from fever was shortened by one day (3.2 days control vs. 2.2 days HCQ, p = 0.0008); time to cessation of cough was similarly reduced (3.1 days control vs. 2.0 days HCQ, p = 0.0016).<br>Overall, it appears that HCQ treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 has a modest effect on clinical recovery (symptom relief on average 1 day earlier) but may be more potent in reducing the progression from mild to severe disease.</p><p><b>Study Limitations </b></p><p>This study is limited in its inclusion of only patients with mild disease, and exclusion of those on any treatment other than the standard of care. It would also have been important to include the laboratory values of positive RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 to compare the baseline and evolution of the patients’ viral load.</p><p><b>Significance</b></p><p>Despite its limitations, the study design has good rigor as a double blind RCT and consistent symptom checks on each day of the trail. Now that the FDA has approved HCQ for treatment of COVID-19 in the USA, this study supports the efficacy of HCQ use early in treatment of patients showing mild symptoms, to improve time to clinical recovery, and possibly reduce disease progression. However, most of the current applications of HCQ have been in patients with severe disease and for compassionate use, which are out of the scope of the findings presented in this trial. Several additional clinical trials to examine hydroxychloroquine are now undergoing; their results will be critical to further validate these findings.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Rachel Levantovsky as a part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty in the Immunology Institute at the Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758";"2020-03-30";"22:23:50";"2020-03-30T22:23:50";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v1";"2020.03.22.20040758"

The aim was to describe clinical, epidemiological and laboratory features of fatal cases in order to identify the possible primary mortality causes related to COVID-19.</p><p>Among 101 death cases, 56.44% were confirmed by RT-PCR and 43.6% by clinical diagnostics. Males dominated the number of deaths and the average age was 65.46 years. All patients died of respiratory failure and multiple organs failure, except one (acute coronary syndrome). The predominant comorbidities were hypertension (42.57%) and diabetes (22.77%). 25.74% of the patients presented more than two underlying diseases. 82% of patients presented myocardial enzymes abnormalities at admission and further increase in myocardial damage indicators with disease progression: patients with elevated Troponin I progressed faster to death. Alterations in coagulation were also detected. Indicators of liver and kidney damage increased 48 hours before death. The authors studied the deceased patients’ blood type and presented the following results: type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB (8.08%) and type O (18.19%), which is inconsistent with the distribution in Han population in Wuhan.</p><p>Clinical analysis showed that the most common symptom was fever (91.9%), followed by cough and dyspnea. The medium time from onset of symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development was 12 days. Unlike SARS, only 2 patients with COVID-19 had diarrhea. 98% presented abnormal lung imaging at admission and most had double-lung abnormalities. Related to the laboratorial findings some inflammatory indicators gradually increased during the disease progression, such as IL-6 secretion in the circulation, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), while platelets numbers decreased. The authors also reported an initial lymphopenia that was followed by an increase in the lymphocytes numbers. Neutrophil count increased with disease progression.</p><p>The patients received different treatments such as antiviral drugs (60.40%), glucocorticoids, thymosin and immunoglobulins. All patients received antibiotic treatment and some received antifungal drugs. All patients received oxygen therapy (invasive or non-invasive ones).</p><p>Limitations<br>This study involves just fatal patients, lacking comparisons with other groups of patients e.g. patients that recovered from COVID-19. The authors didn’t discuss the different approaches used for treatments and how these may affect the several parameters measured. The possible relationship between the increase of inflammatory indicators and morbidities of COVID-19 are not discussed.</p><p>Relevance<br>This study has the largest cohort of fatal cases reported so far. The authors show that COVID-19 causes fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. This study highlights prevalent myocardial damage and indicates that cardiac function of COVID-19 patients should be carefully monitored. The data suggest that Troponin I should be further investigated as an early indicator of patients with high risk of accelerated health deterioration. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections were frequent in critically ill patients and these need to be carefully monitored in severe COVID-19 patients. Differences in blood type distribution were observed, suggesting that type A is detrimental while type O is protective – but further studies are needed to confirm these findings and elucidate if blood type influences infection or disease severity. Several inflammatory indicators (neutrophils, PCT, CRP and IL-6, D-dimer) increased according to disease severity and should be assessed as biomarkers and to better understand the biology of progression to severe disease.<br>Reviewed as part of a project by students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.09.20033068";"2020-03-30";"21:04:58";"2020-03-30T21:04:58";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033068v2";"2020.03.09.20033068"

This is a feasibility pilot study. The authors report the administration and clinical benefit of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) (1:640 titer) derived from recently cured donors (CP selected among 40 donors based on high neutralizing titer and ABO compatibility) to 10 severe COVID-19 patients with confirmed viremia. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The secondary endpoint were clinical signs of improvement based on symptoms and laboratory parameters.</p><p>The authors reported use of methylene blue photochemistry to inactivate any potential residual virus in the plasma samples, without compromising neutralizing antibodies, and no virus was detected before transfusion.</p><p>The authors report the following:<br>	No adverse events were observed in all patients, except 1 patient who exhibited transient facial red spotting.<br>	All patients showed significant improvement in or complete disappearance of clinical symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain after 3 days of CP therapy. <br>	Reduction of pulmonary lesions revealed by chest CT.<br>	Elevation of lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocytopenia. <br>	Increase in SaO2 in all patients, indicative of recuperating lung function. <br>	Resolution of SARS-CoV-2 viremia in 7 patients and increase in neutralizing antibody titers in 5 patients. Persistence of neutralizing antibody levels in 4 patients.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br>It is important to note that most recipients had high neutralization titers of antibodies before plasma transfusion and even without transfusion it would be expected to see an increase in neutralizing antibodies over time. In addition to the small sample set number (n=10), there are additional limitations to this pilot study:<br>1.	All patients received concurrent therapy, in addition to the CP transfusion. Therefore, it is unclear whether a combinatorial or synergistic effect between these standards of care and CP transfusion contributed to the clearance of viremia and improvement of symptoms in these COVID-19 patients. <br>2.	The kinetics of viral clearance was not investigated, with respect to the administration of CP transfusion. So, the definitive impact of CP transfusion on immune dynamics and subsequent viral load is not well defined.<br>3.	Comparison with a small historical control group is not ideal.</p><p><u>Relevance</u><br>For the first time, a pilot study provides promising results involving the use of convalescent plasma from cured COVID-19 patients to treat others with more severe disease. The authors report that the administration of a single, high-dose of neutralizing antibodies is safe. In addition, there were encouraging results with regards to the reduction of viral load and improvement of clinical outcomes. It is, therefore, necessary to expand this type of study with more participants, in order to determine optimal dose and treatment kinetics. It is important to note that CP has been studied to treat H1N1 influenza, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, although it has not been proven to be effective in treating these infections.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145";"2020-03-30";"15:38:19";"2020-03-30T15:38:19";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1";"2020.03.16.20036145"

Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 were selected for data extraction. 80% of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IRQ, 36-120). Most frequent therapies in the trials included; 1) antiviral drugs [lopinavir/ritonavir (n-15); umifenovir (n=9);  favipiravir (n=7); redmesivir (n=5)]; 2) anti-malaria drugs [chloroquine (n-11); hydroxychloroquine (n=7)}; immunosuppressant drugs [methylprednisolone (n=5)]; and stem cell therapies (n=23). Medians of the total number of planned inclusions per trial for these therapies were also included. Stem cells and lopunavir/ritonavir were the most frequently evaluated candidate therapies (23 and 15 trials respectively), whereas remdesivir was only tested in 5 trials but these trials had the highest median number of planned inclusions per trial (400, IQR 394-453). Most of the agents used in the different trials were chosen based on preclinical assessments of antiviral activity against SARS CoV and MERS Cov corona viruses.</p><p>The primary outcomes of the studies were clinical (66%); virological (23%); radiological (8%); or immunological (3%). The trials were classified as those that included patients with severe disease only; trials that included patients with moderate disease; and trials that included patients with severe or moderate disease.</p><p>Limitations: The trials evaluated provided incomplete information: 23% of these were phase IV trials but the bulk of the trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Only 52% of the trials (n=60) reported treatment dose and only 34% (n=39) reported the duration. A lot of the trials included a small number of patients and the trials are still ongoing, therefore no insight was provided on the outcome of the trials.</p><p>Significance: Nonetheless, this review serves as framework for identifying COVID-19 related trials, which can be expanded upon as new trials begin at an accelerated rate as the disease spreads around the world.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.18.20038190";"2020-03-30";"15:27:50";"2020-03-30T15:27:50";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038190v2";"2020.03.18.20038190"

Proportion of severe and critical patients in the ALT elevation group was significantly higher than that of normal ALT group. Multivariate logistic regression performed on clinical factors related to ALT elevation showed that CRP ≥ 20mg/L and low lymphocyte count (&lt;1.1*10^9 cells/L) were independently related to ALT elevation—a finding that led the authors to suggest cytokine storm as a major mechanism of liver damage.</p><p>Limitations: The article’s most attractive claim that liver damage seen in COVID patients is caused by cytokine storm (rather than direct infection of the liver) hinges solely on their multivariate regression analysis. Without further mechanistic studies a) demonstrating how high levels of inflammatory cytokines can induce liver damage and b) contrasting types of liver damage incurred by direct infection of the liver vs. system-wide elevation of inflammatory cytokines, their claim remains thin. It is also worth noting that six of their elevated ALT group (n=33) had a history of liver disease (i.e. HBV infection, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver) which can confound their effort to pin down the cause of hepatic injury to COVID.</p><p>Significance of the finding: Limited.

Magnetic Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassay was used to evaluate IgM and IgG seroconversion in 285 hospital admitted patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and in 52 COVID-19 suspected patients that tested negative by RT-PCR. A follow up study with 63 patients was performed to investigate longitudinal effects. In addition, IgG and IgM titers were evaluated in a cohort of close contacts (164 persons) of an infected couple.</p><p>The median day of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM was 13 days after symptom onset. Patients varied in the order of IgM/ IgG seroconversion and there was no apparent correlation of order with age, severity, or hospitalization time. This led the authors to conclude that for diagnosis IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection.</p><p>IgG titers, but not IgM titers were higher in severe patients compared to non-severe patients after controlling for days post-symptom onset. Importantly, 12% of COVID-19 patients (RT-PCR confirmed) did not meet the WHO serological diagnosis criterion of either seroconversion or &gt; 4-fold increase in IgG titer in sequential samples. This suggests the current serological criteria may be too stringent for COVID-19 diagnosis.</p><p>Of note, 4 patients from a group of 52 suspects (negative RT-PCR test) had anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgM and IgG. Similarly, 4.3% (7/162) of “close contacts” who had negative RT-PCR tests were positive for IgG and/or IgM. This highlights the usefulness of a serological assay to identify asymptomatic infections and/or infections that are missed by RT-PCR.</p><p>Limitations:<br>This group’s report generally confirms the findings of others that have evaluated the acute antibody response to SARS-Cov-2. However, these data would benefit from inclusion of data on whether the participants had a documented history of viral infection. Moreover, serum samples that were collected prior to SARS-Cov-2 outbreak from patients with other viral infections would serve as a useful negative control for their assay. Methodological limitations include that only one serum sample per case was tested as well as the heat inactivation of serum samples prior to testing. It has previously been reported that heat inactivation interferes with the level of antibodies to SARS-Cov-2 and their protocol may have resulted in diminished quantification of IgM, specifically (Xiumei Hu et al, <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.03.12.20034231v1%29%3A8z85lI2RGBrdNiD8JTguOe3D0Wc&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231v1)"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a>.</p><p>Relevance:<br>Understanding the features of the antibody responses against SARS-CoV is useful in the development of a serological test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

There is ample transmission in humid tropical countries, and it is taking off and case numbers are mounting quickly. Your study outcome and predictions are falsified, and responsible scientists would accept that point and respond accordingly.

That is what created the ""niche"" that you guys used for your projections. The temperate-zone focus that you predicted is not upheld...

This unfolding emergency has prompted the<br> preparation and dissemination of the article “Spread of SARS-CoV-2 <br>Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate” by Araújo and Naimi <br>(2020).  The authors present the results of an ensemble forecast made <br>from a suite of species distribution models (SDMs), where they attempt <br>to predict the suitability of the climate for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 <br>over the coming months.  They argue that climate is likely to be a <br>primary regulator for the spread of the infection and that people in <br>warm-temperate and cold climates are more vulnerable than those in <br>tropical and arid climates.  A central finding of their study is that <br>the possibility of a synchronous global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is <br>unlikely.  Whilst we understand that the motivations behind producing <br>such work are grounded in trying to be helpful, we demonstrate here that<br> there are clear conceptual and methodological deficiencies with their <br>study that render their results and conclusions invalid.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728";"2020-03-29";"10:45:38";"2020-03-29T10:45:38";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728v1";"2020.03.12.20034728"

They performed a 16-day kinetic analysis of peripheral blood from time of disease onset. Patients in the severe group were older (medium age of 59.7, compared to 48.7 in mild group) and more likely to have hypertension as a co-morbidity. Lymphopenia was observed in 44.4% of the mild patients and 84.6% of the severe patients. Lymphopenia was due to low T cell count, specially CD8 T cells. Severe patients showed higher neutrophil counts and an increase of cytokines in the serum (IL2, IL6, IL10 and IFNγ). The authors measured several other clinical laboratory parameters were also in severe cases compared to mild, but concluded that neutrophil to CD8 T cell ratio (N8R) as the best prognostic factor to identify the severe cases compared to other receiver operating characteristic (ROC).</p><p><u>Limitations:</u> This was a small cohort (N=40), and two of the patients initially included in the severe group (N=13) passed away and were excluded from the analysis due to lack of longitudinal data. However, it would be most important to be able to identify patients with severe disease with higher odds of dying. It seems that the different time points analyzed relate to hospital admission, which the authors describe as disease onset. The time between first symptoms and first data points is not described. It would have been important to analyze how the different measured parameters change according to health condition, and not just time (but that would require a larger cohort). The predictive value of N8R compared to the more commonly used NLR (Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio) needs to be assessed in other independent and larger cohorts. Lastly, it is important to note that pneumonia was detected in patients included in the “mild” group, but according to the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) this group should be considered “moderate”.</p><p><u>Relevance:</u> Lymphopenia and cytokine storm have been described to be detrimental in many other infections including SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV. However, it was necessary to confirm that this dramatic immune response was also observed in the SARS-CoV2 infected patients. These results and further validation of the N8R ratio as a predictor of disease severity will contribute for the management of COVID19 patients and potential development of therapies.</p><p><i>Review by Pauline Hamon as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671";"2020-03-28";"01:57:06";"2020-03-28T01:57:06";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023671v2";"2020.02.16.20023671"

Think of a blown up balloon that with some means you cause it to lose its tension strength so that it ruptures or divides into small fragments. A lot of substances can disrupt the envelope and each takes a certain amount of time. Some work quickly. Others not as quickly. I believe all the substances require to be in a water saturated fluid condition. Therefore a spray would not work unless it totally saturates the media in question. Therefore also, a total immersion would be the optimal condition. Thus drying the product after sanitizing is a process issue. Supposedly some alcohol solutions work very quickly.  This would be easier to dry then I imagine that an immersion in detergent water solution. Detergents, like soap, also disrupt the envelope but perhaps not as quickly. But alcohol vapor is explosive. Bleach solutions also work but bleach destroys materials. I think the disruption time is measured in minutes, so time may not be an issue for your production. Cotton drys quickly with heat and lots of air movement. If the concern is production, then a regular laundry wash and drying should be perfectly fine. If the concern is sanitizing after use then immediately dropping the item into a detergent solution, perhaps enhanced with another chemical like alcohol or bleach, might be the thing to do.

Also, virological clearance was more rapid with median of 3 days in the Meplazumab group vs 13 days in control group. In laboratory values, a faster normalization of lymphocyte counts in the Meplazumab group was observed, but no clear difference was observed for CRP levels.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b> While the results from the study are encouraging, this study was non-randomized, open-label and on a small number of patients, all from the same hospital. It offers evidence to perform a larger scale study. Selection bias as well as differences between treatment groups (e.g. age 51yo vs 64yo) may have contributed to results. The authors mention that there was no toxic effect to Meplazumab injection but more patient and longer-term studies are necessary to assess this.</p><p><b>Significance:</b> These results seem promising as for now there are limited treatments for Covid-19 patients, but a larger cohort of patient is needed. CD147 has already been described to facilitate HIV 2, measles virus 3, and malaria 4 entry into host cells. This group was the first  to describe the CD147-spike route of SARS-Cov-2 entry in host cells 1(p147). Indeed, they had previously shown in 2005 that SARS-Cov could enter host cells via this transmembrane protein 5). Further biological understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells and how this integrates with ACE2R route of entry is needed. Also, the specific cellular targets of the anti-CD147 antibody need to be assessed, as this protein can be expressed by many cell types and has been shown to involved in leukocytes aggregation 6. Lastly, Meplazumab is not a commercially-available drug and requires significant health resources to generate and administer which might prevent rapid development and use.</p><p>1.

Sixty-one (61) patients with COVID-19 treated in January at a hospital in Beijing, China were included. On average, patients were seen within 5 days from illness onset. Samples were collected on admission; and then patients were monitored for the development of severe illness with a median follow-up of 10 days].</p><p>Patients were grouped as “mild” (N=44) or “moderate/severe” (N=17) according to symptoms on admission and compared for different clinical/laboratory features. “Moderate/severe” patients were significantly older (median of 56 years old, compared to 41 years old). Whereas comorbidies rates were largely similar between the groups, except for hypertension, which was more frequent in the severe group (p= 0.056). ‘Severe’ patients had higher counts of neutrophils, and serum glucose levels; but lower lymphocyte counts, sodium and serum chlorine levels. The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) was also higher for the ‘severe’ group. ‘Severe’ patients had a higher rate of bacterial infections (and antibiotic treatment) and received more intensive respiratory support and treatment.</p><p>26 clinical/laboratory variables were used to select NLR and age as the best predictors of the severe disease. Predictive cutoffs for a severe illness as NLR ≥ 3.13 or age ≥ 50 years.</p><p>Identification of early biomarkers is important for making clinical decisions, but large sample size and validation cohorts are necessary to confirm findings. It is worth noting that patients classified as “mild” showed pneumonia by imaging and fever, and in accordance with current classifications this would be consistent with “moderate” cases. Hence it would be more appropriate to refer to the groups as “moderate” vs “severe/critical”. Furthermore, there are several limitations that could impact the interpretation of the results: e.g. classification of patients was based on symptoms presented on admission and not based on disease progression, small sample size, especially the number of ‘severe’ cases (with no deaths among these patients). Given the small sample size, the proposed NLR and age cut offs might not hold for a slightly different set of patients. For example, in a study of &gt;400 patients, ‘non-severe’ and ‘severe’ NLR were 3.2 and 5.5, respectively 1.</p><p>References:<br>1.

Patients were further sub-divided into three groups based on clinical symptoms and disease severity: (1) mild, positive Covid19 qPCR with no or mild clinical symptoms (fever; respiratory; radiological abnormalities);  (2) severe, at least one of the following: shortness of breath/respiratory rate &gt;30/min, oxygen saturation SaO2&lt;93%, Horowitz index paO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mmHg (indicating moderate pulmonary damage); and (3) critically ill, at least one additional complicating factor: respiratory failure with need for mechanical ventilation; systemic shock; multi-organ failure and transfer to ICU. Serum samples and throat-swaps were collected from all 48 patients enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by qPCR with positive results being defined as Ct values &lt; 40, and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was quantified using a commercially available detection kit. Briefly, patient characteristics in this study confirm previous reports suggesting that higher age and comorbidities are significant risk factors of clinical severity. Of note, 5 out of 48 of patients (10.41%), all in the critically ill category, were found to have detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, so-called RNAaemia. Moreover, serum IL-6 levels in these patients were found to be substantially higher and this correlated with the presence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels. The authors hypothesize that viral RNA might be released from acutely damages tissues in moribund patients during the course of Covid19 and that RNaemia along with IL-6 could potentially be used as a prognostic marker.</p><p>Potential limitations</p><p>While this group’s report generally confirms some of the major findings of a more extensive study, published in early February 2020, (Huang C et al, Lancet 2020; 395:497-506; <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Faction%2FshowPdf%3Fpii%3DS0140-6736%252820%252930183-5%29%3Ae6acqwnaZTiLdkRNBfdDASOOP0g&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930183-5)"">https://www.thelancet.com/a...</a>, there are limitations that should be taken into account. First, the number of patients enrolled is relatively small; second, interpretation of these data would benefit from inclusion of information about study specifics as well as providing relevant data on the clinical course of these patients other than the fact that some were admitted to ICU (i.e. demographics on how many patients needed respiratory support, dialysis, APACHE Ii/III or other standard ICU scores as robust prognostic markers for mortality etc). It also remains unclear at which time point the serum samples were taken, i.e. whether at admission, when the diagnosis was made or during the course of the hospital stay (and potentially after onset of therapy, which could have affected both IL-6 and RNA levels). The methods section lacks important information on the qPCR protocol employed, including primers and cycling conditions used. From a technical point of view, Ct values &gt;35 seem somewhat non-specific (although Ct &lt;40 was defined as the CDC cutoff as well) indicating that serum RNA levels are probably very low, therefore stressing the need for highly specific primers and high qPCR efficiency. In addition, the statistical tests used (t-tests, according to the methods section) do not seem appropriate as the organ-specific data such as BUN and troponin T values seem to be not normally distributed across groups (n= 5 RNAaemia+ vs. n= 43 RNAaemia-). Given the range of standard deviations and the differences in patient sample size, it is difficult to believe that these data are statistically significantly different.</p><p>Overall relevance for the field</p><p>This study is very rudimentary and lacks a lot of relevant clinical details. However, it corroborates some previously published observations regarding RNAemia and IL-6 by another group. Generally, regarding future studies, it would be important to address the question of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokine dynamics in relation to Covid19 disease kinetics (high levels of IL-6, IL-8 and plasma leukotriene were shown to have prognostic value at the onset of ARDS ; serum IL-2 and IL-15 have been associated with mortality; reviewed by Chen W &amp; Ware L, Clin Transl Med. 2015).</p><p>Reviewed as part of a project by students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520";"2020-03-25";"22:19:11";"2020-03-25T22:19:11";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520v1";"2020.02.29.20029520"

Renal functions remained stable in these patients. <br>- All 5 patients with CRF survived CoVID-19 therapy without progression to ARDS or worsening of CRF.</p><p><u>Limitations: </u><br>- Renal injury biomarkers in patients with incipient kidney abnormalities not tabulated separately, making overall data hard to interpret. It will be critical to separately examine kidney function (BUN, urine creatinine and eGFR) in patients that developed any kidney abnormalities (7.2~10.8% of cohort).  <br>- No information on type of CoVID-19 therapy used across cohort; will be useful to correlate how treatment modality influences kidney function (and other parameters).  <br>- Invokes previous clinical-correlation studies that indicate low instances of kidney damage [1,2], but those studies did not track longitudinal urine samples for acute renal injury markers and viral shedding.   <br>- CRRT in patients with CRF is standard therapy irrespective of CoVID-19 status; it will be important to compare clinical parameters of these patients (n=5) with virus-naïve CRF patients (none in this study) to make any meaningful conclusions.</p><p><u>Importance/Relevance: </u><br>- This study argues that renal impairment is uncommon in CoVID-19 and not associated with high mortaility, in stark contrast to a concurrent study (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1101%2F2020.02.08.20021212%3AQD_1eHEw9tpVELSLj0TaOhVgxyc&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212"">https://doi.org/10.1101/202...</a> ).

The median time from first symptom to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 10 days. All patients had decreased CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells, and a significant increase of serum IL-6. Furthermore, 91% had decreased NK cells. The changes in IL-6 levels preceded those in CD4 and CD8 cell counts.

However, the effect of this step on downstream SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody assays has not been examined. The authors tested the effect of heat inactivation (56 deg C for 30 minutes) versus no heat inactivation on a fluorescence immunochromatography assay. Heat inactivation reduced all IgM measurements by an average of 54% and most IgG measurements (22/36 samples, average reduction of 50%), consistent with the lower thermal stability of IgM than that of IgG. Heat inactivation caused a subset of IgM but not IgG readings to fall below a specified positivity threshold.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br>Limitations included the use of only one type of assay for testing heat inactivated vs non-inactivated sera, and the use of the same baseline for heat inactivated and non-inactivated sera. The results indicate that heat inactivation affects the quantification of SARS-CoV-2-antibody response, specially IgM, but still allows to distinguish positive specific IgG. Therefore, the effect of heat inactivation should be studied when designing assays that quantitatively associate immunoglobulin levels (especially IgM) to immune state.</p><p><i>Review by Andrew M.

Cytokine profiling of COVID patients reveal that TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 are increased in infected patients with patients in the ICU showing the highest levels. Interestingly, these three cytokine levels were inversely correlated with T cell counts and such inverse relationship was preserved throughout the disease progression. Surface staining of exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim-3) and flow cytometry of stained peripheral blood of 14 patients and 3 healthy volunteers demonstrate that T cells of COVID patients have increased expression of PD-1 with patients in ICU having the highest number of CD8+PD-1+ cells than their counterparts in non-ICU groups.</p><p>Limitations: Compared to the number of patients, number of control (n= 40) is small and is not controlled for age. Additional data linking inflammatory cytokines and the quality of the adaptive response including humoral and antigen specific T cell response is much needed. T cell exhaustion study relies on marker-dependent labeling of T cell functionality of a very limited sample size (n=17)—a functional/mechanistic study of these T cells from PBMCs would have bolstered their claims.</p><p>Significance of the finding: Limited but contains interesting implications. It is already known in literature that in the context of acute respiratory viral infections CD8 T cells exhibit exhaustion-like phenotypes which further underscores the importance of mechanistic studies that can elucidate how COVID infection leads to lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion-like phenotype. However, as authors have noted, the data does point to an interesting question: How these inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10) correlate with or affect effective viral immunity and what types of cells produce these cytokines? Answering that question will help us refine our targets for immune-modulatory therapies especially in patients suffering from cytokine storms.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364";"2020-03-25";"05:18:54";"2020-03-25T05:18:54";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1";"2020.02.18.20024364"

The authors have also tracked LYM% of 70 cases (15 deaths; 15 severe; 40 moderate) throughout the disease progression with fatal cases showing no recovery of lymphocytes ( &lt;5%) even after 17-19 days post-onset. The temporal data of LYM % in COVID patients was used to construct a Time-Lymphocyte% model which is used to categorize and predict patients’ disease severity and progression. The model was validated using 92 hospitalized cases and kappa statistic test was used to assess agreement between predicted disease severity and the assigned clinical severity (k = 0.49).</p><p>Limitations: Time-Lymphocyte % Model (TLM) that authors have proposed as a predictive   model for clinical severity is very simple in its construction and derives from correlative data of 162 patients.

Antibodies specific to SARS-CoV N protein (90% similarity to SARS-CoV-2) were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by PRNT (plaque reduction neutralizing test).  SARS-CoV-2 serum cross-reacted with SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins, and to a lower extent with MERS-CoV S protein, but not with the MERS-CoV S1 protein, consistent with an analysis of genetic similarity.  No reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was observed in serum from patients with ubiquitous human CoV infections (common cold) or to non-CoV viral respiratory infections.</p><p>Analysis: Authors describe development of a serological ELISA based assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies towards regions of the spike and nucleocapsid domains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Serum samples were obtained from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients.  Negative control samples include a cohort of patients with confirmed recent exposure to non-CoV infections (i.e. adenovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, influenza, RSV, CMV, EBV) as well as a cohort of patients with confirmed infections with ubiquitous human CoV infe<br>ctions known to cause the common cold. The study also included serum from patients with previous MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV zoonotic infections. This impressive patient cohort allowed the authors to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the development of their in-house ELISA assay. Of note, seroconversion was observed as early as 13 days following COVID-19 onset but the authors were not clear how disease onset was determined.</p><p>Importance: Validated serological tests are urgently needed to map the full spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population and to determine the kinetics of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.  Furthermore, clinical trials are ongoing using plasma from patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 as a therapeutic option.  An assay such as the one described in this study could be used to screen for strong antibody responses in recovered patients.  Furthermore, the assay could be used to screen health care workers for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 as personal protective equipment continues to dwindle.

This study compares peripheral blood from healthy controls from the same regions in Shanghai and Beijing, and COVID-19 patients to standardize a reference range of lymphocyte counts stratified by age.</p><p>Key findings: Lower levels of lymphocyte counts - CD4 and CD8 T cells- correlated with disease severity (T cell counts were significantly lower in critical patients (in intensive care units, ICU) vs non-ICU). Based on 14,117 normal controls in Chinese Han population (ranging in age from 18-86) the authors recommended that reference ranges of people with CD3+ lymphocytes below 900 cells/mm3, CD4+ lymphocytes below 500 cells/mm3, and CD8+ lymphocytes below 300 cells/mm3 be considered high risk of severe COVID-19. However, COVID-19 patients were not stratified by age. This study reported that the levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and IL-6 were elevated in COVID-19 pts., indicating clot formation, severe inflammation and cytokine storm, but these parameters were not shown for healthy controls Authors compare data from patients in Shanghai and Beijing with patients in Wuhan, but clinical data from patients in Wuhan are not presented and it is unclear where data from Wuhan were obtained. The authors suggest a correlation between mortality rates and lymphocyte counts when comparing different regions in China, but this claim is not substantiated by data analysis.

Data was compared to scRNAseq of samples collected from patients with influenza A (n=1), acute pharyngitis (n=1), and cerebral infarction (n=1), as well as, three healthy controls. COVID-19 patients were categorized into those with moderate (n=6), severe (n=1), critical (n=1), and cured (n=2) disease. Analysis across all COVID-19 disease levels revealed 56 different cellular subtypes, among 17 immune cell types; comparisons between each category to the normal controls revealed <b>increased proportions of CD1c+ dendritic cells, CD8+ CTLs, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells and a decrease in proportions of B cells and CD4+ T cells</b>.</p><p><b>TCR sequencing revealed that greater clonality is associated with milder COVID-19 disease</b>; BCR sequencing revealed that COVID-19 patients have circulating antibodies against known viral antigens, including EBV, HIV, influenza A, and other RNA viruses. This may suggest that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits production of antibodies against known RNA viruses.</p><p>Excluding enriched pathways shared by COVID-19 patients and patients with other conditions (influenza A, acute pharyngitis, and cerebral infarction), the authors identified the <b>interferon-MAPK signaling pathway as a major response to SARS-CoV-2 infection</b>. The authors performed quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for interferon-MAPK signaling genes: IRF27, BST2, and FOS. These samples were collected from a separate cohort of COVID-19 patients (critical, n=3; severe, n=3; moderate, n=19; mild, n=3; and cured, n=10; and healthy controls, n=5). Notably, consistent with the original scRNAseq data, FOS showed up-regulation in COVID-19 patients and down-regulation in cured patients. <b>The authors propose that FOS may be a candidate marker gene for curative COVID-19 disease</b>.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br>The sample size of this study is limited. To further delineate differences in the immune profile of peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a greater sample size is needed, and longitudinal samples are needed, as well. A better understanding of the immunological interactions in cured patients, for example, would require a profile before and after improvement.</p><p>Moreover, the conclusions drawn from this scRNAseq study point to potential autoimmunity and immune deficiency to distinguish different severities of COVID-19 disease. However, this requires an expanded number of samples and a more robust organization of specific immune cell subtypes that can be compared across different patients. Importantly, this criterion is likely needed to ensure greater specificity in identifying markers for COVID-19 infection and subsequent immune response.</p><p><u>Relevance</u><br>At the single-cell level, COVID-19 disease has been characterized in the lung, but a greater understanding of systemic immunological responses is furthered in this study. Type I interferon is an important signaling molecule for the anti-viral response. The identification of the interferon-MAPK signaling pathway and the differential expression of MAPK regulators between patients of differing COVID-19 severity and compared to cured patients may underscore the importance of either immune deficiency or autoimmunity in COVID-19 disease.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472";"2020-03-24";"04:17:55";"2020-03-24T04:17:55";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20033472v1";"2020.03.15.20033472"

Townsend Peterson, University of Kansas</p><p>I read the above-referenced manuscript preprint with interest. Araújo and Naimi are leaders in the field of distributional ecology, so I was (and am) interested in their perspective on the distributional ecology of SARS-CoV-2, and the COVID-19 disease that it causes. Obviously, the question is quite current, such that I’m interested in the topic and the ideas, but also in getting answers that will prove robust and predictive. For this reason, I take the rather odd step of offering a peer review, even though no one has asked for it…</p><p>My interest in this manuscript was piqued most of all by the statement in the Abstract that “the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics.” If true, this would be an interesting, and quite promising and optimistic result, as many are concerned about what will happen when SARS-CoV-2 begins to spread in Southeast Asia, Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, etc. So I will focus my comments on this result and the assumptions that revolve around it.</p><p>PRESENCE DATA<br>The occurrence data in the analysis were derived from available COVID-19 case occurrence data. “Coronavirus cases by the 10/03/2020 with data compiled and made available to the John Hopkins University Mapping 2019-nCoV portal... Regions with fewer than 5 positive cases were not included in the models. Exclusion of such sites was based on the working assumption that sites with small numbers of positive cases are likely imported from infected regions, thus failing to provide evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus is being transmitted locally within its ecological niche.” And also, in the Discussion of the manuscript… “Firstly, there is little reason to suspect that out-of-China contaminations would have occurred only, or mainly, with trade partners in the northern hemisphere... China is a big world player, having key commercial partnerships with Africa and Latin America. Yet there is not indication that meaningful local infections have taken place in these areas despite the global reporting of Coronavirus cases generally attributed to travelers coming from infected regions.”</p><p>This seemingly logical methodological step has rather important implications. It is true that many of the “singleton” occurrences will represent imported cases that were the result of infection taking place in early foci of infections (e.g., central China, Italy) and being taken to those places by travelers. In that sense, this methodological step is reasonable and logical. However, one should consider some important sources of bias that are likely associated with elimination of regions with few records…</p><p>1. Connectivity is nonrandom. That is, consider Wuhan, in central China. Check out the airline network connectivity visualizations shown in <a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Frocs.hu-berlin.de%2Fcorona%2Fdocs%2Fanalysis%2Fvisual_analytics%2F%3AYW-2mPOvVxpIB-lr1cq2MwepLMs&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/corona/docs/analysis/visual_analytics/"">http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/co...</a>. Its primary connections are all to northern, mesic, and temperate regions, and not at all directly to tropical and arid regions. Indeed, even given that major desert regions lie not too far to the west of Wuhan, they are not densely populated, such that land-based connections are also mostly to the east, and not to desert or tropical regions.</p><p>2. Testing bias. The relative unavailability of testing for COVID-19 cases has been commented extensively, even in the United States. The lack of testing clearly has resulted in broad (but silent) spread of COVID-19 prior to recognition of the broader extent of case distributions, as has been documented in Washington State, a COVID-19 focus in the western United States. With developing-world public health infrastructures being challenged with other, perhaps more pressing and immediate questions (e.g., dengue, malaria), COVID-19-caused respiratory problems and a few deaths from some pneumonia syndrome of unknown cause can easily go unrecognized. As COVID-19 testing becomes easier and faster, and the possibility for point-of-contact testing becomes a reality, I strongly suspect that many more tropical/humid cities will emerge as additional sites of viral transfer and COVID-19 infection.</p><p>ABSENCE OR BACKGROUND DATA<br>The authors appear not to have provided any information about the region over which they calibrated and evaluated their models (I will not go into problems with ROC AUC that are well-known, and do not need restating). This choice is well-known to make important differences in modeling outcomes [see Anderson, R. P., and A. Raza. 2010. The effect of the extent of the study region on GIS models of species geographic distributions and estimates of niche evolution: preliminary tests with montane rodents (genus Nephelomys) in Venezuela. Journal of Biogeography 37:1378-1393.]. Indeed, the calibration region should be a combination of the area that has been accessible to the species over relevant time periods, and the area over which sampling was conducted (Barve, N., V. Barve, A. Jimenez-Valverde, A. Lira-Noriega, S. P. Maher, A. T. Peterson, J. Soberón, and F. Villalobos. 2011. The crucial role of the accessible area in ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling. Ecological Modelling 222:1810-1819.).</p><p>Not only should the calibration area and the assumptions that led to that set of choices be made explicit, but they should be made in consideration of real-world features of the system at hand. That is, if the authors indeed calibrated their models at global extents, then that is a tacit assumption that the virus had had access to the entire Earth’s surface, but only “liked” (in a niche sense) the places where &gt;5 cases have been manifested. At least in the early stages of this epidemic, this assumption clearly is not robust, and will bias the model results against the suitability of humid tropical areas. A better approach might be to take primary and perhaps secondary linkages of air and land transportation, and to use them to create an accessible area hypothesis that responds better to the actual phenomenon at hand. Such a more conservative estimate of an accessible area might well reveal that hot and humid sites were not available to SARS-CoV-2 given realistic hypotheses of the dispersal potential of the virus, and the resulting conclusions about the distributional potential of the virus would likely be quite different.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS<br>The authors interpreted the importance and significance of their results thus: “… it appears the virus favors cool and dry conditions being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wet conditions.” And… “Much of the tropics have low levels of climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus owing to their high temperatures and precipitation (used here as a surrogate for humidity), followed by polar climates, where conditions of extreme cold temperatures seem to be beyond the virus critical minimum tolerance values. In most of such low climate suitability areas, human populations will likely be spared from outbreaks arising from local transmissions...”</p><p>Very simply, methodological decisions were made in this analysis that will lead to different conclusions. Decisions such as eliminating sites with few records, or using a global calibration area, as well as the testing bias discussed above, all align in leading to overfit models that will snug overmuch to the areas and environmental regimes where cases have already occurred. I do not think that the conclusions about low tropical/humid suitability are likely to prove robust, and I do not know enough about the conclusions of seasonality (which I have not discussed or assessed above).</p><p>Town Peterson</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728";"2020-03-22";"16:58:48";"2020-03-22T16:58:48";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034728v1";"2020.03.12.20034728"

Patients who refused participation or patients from another center not treated with HCQ were included as negative controls (n = 16). Among the patients in the treatment arm, 6 received concomitant azithromycin to prevent superimposed bacterial infection. The primary endpoint was respiratory viral loads on day 6 post enrollment, measured by nasopharyngeal swab followed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR.</p><p>HCQ alone was able to significantly reduce viral loads by day 6 (n = 8/14, 57.1% complete clearance, p &lt; 0.001); azithromycin appears to be synergistic with HCQ, as 6/6 patients receiving combined treatment had complete viral clearance (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p> Chloroquine is thought to inhibit viral infection, including SARS-Cov-2, by increasing pH within endosomes and lysosomes, altering the biochemical conditions required for viral fusion1,2. However, chloroquine also has immuno-modulatory effects that I think may play a role. Chloroquine has been shown to increase CTLA-4 expression at the cell surface by decreasing its degradation in the endo-lysosome pathway; AP-1 traffics the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 to lysosomes, but in conditions of increased pH, the protein machinery required for degradation is less functional3. As such, more CTLA-4 remains in endosomes and is trafficked back to the cell surface. It is possible that this may also contribute to patient recovery via reduction of cytokine storm, in addition to the direct anti-viral effects of HCQ.</p><p>Despite what is outlined above, this study has a number of limitations that must be considered. First, there were originally n = 26 patients in the treatment arm, with 6 lost to follow up for the following reasons: 3 transferred to ICU, 1 discharge, 1 self-discontinued treatment d/t side effects, and 1 patient expired. Total length of clinical follow up was 14 days, but the data beyond day 6 post-inclusion are not shown.</p><p>Strikingly, in supplementary table 1, results of the real-time RT-PCR are listed for the control and treatment arms from D0 – D6. However, the data are not reported in a standard way, with a mix of broadly positive or negative result delineation with Ct (cycle threshold) values, the standard output of real time PCR. It is impossible to compare what is defined as a positive value between the patients in the control and treatment arms without a standardized threshold for a positive test. Further, the starting viral loads reported at D0 in the groups receiving HCQ or HCQ + azithromycin were significantly different (ct of 25.3 vs 26.8 respectively), which could explain in part the differences observed in the response to treatment between 2 groups. Finally, patients in the control arm from outside the primary medical center in this study (Marseille) did not actually have samples tested by PCR daily. Instead, positive test results from every other day were extrapolated to mean positive results on the day before and after testing as well (Table 2, footnote a).</p><p>Taken together, the results of this study suggest that HCQ represents a promising treatment avenue for COVID-19 patients. However, the limited size of the trial, and the way in which the results were reported does not allow for other medical centers to extrapolate a positive or negative result in the treatment of their own patients with HCQ +/- azithromycin. Further larger randomized clinical trials will be required to ascertain the efficacy of HCQ +/- azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19.</p><p>References</p><p>1.	Wang, M. et al.

"1007";"4869182270";"sinaiimmunologyreviewproject";"Sinai Immunol Review Project";"<p>Key findings<br>The authors investigated the use of a commercially available form of heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), as a therapeutic drug for patients with COVID-19. Previous studies showed that in addition to its anticoagulant properties, LMWH exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the release of IL-6 and counteracting IL-6.</p><p>This was a retrospective single-center study conducted in Wuhan, China. Forty-two (42) hospitalized patients with coronavirus pneumonia were included, of which 21 underwent LMWH treatment (heparin group) and 21 did not (control). The general characteristics of the two groups of patients were statistically comparable. Both control and LMWH had the same hospitalization time and there were no critical cases in either group.</p><p>This study found that treatment with LMWH significantly reduced IL-6 levels in patients in the heparin group compared to the control group. However, LMWH treatment did not have an effect on the levels of other inflammatory factors: CRP, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-, and IFN-. Compared with the control group, patients in the heparin group had a significantly increased percentage of lymphocytes after treatment, further suggesting that LMWH treatment has anti-inflammatory effects and can reduce the lymphopenia associated with COVID-19.</p><p>Consistent with other studies in COVID-19 patients, they found that LMWH treatment can improve hypercoagulability. D-dimer and FDP levels (biomarkers of coagulation) in the heparin group significantly decreased from baseline after treatment, whereas there was no significant change in levels for the control group. Of note however, patients in the heparin group had a significantly higher level of D-dimer and FDP at baseline compared to the control group.</p><p>Importance<br>Many studies have shown that severely ill COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of IL-6 compared to patients with mild cases and it has been proposed that progression to severe disease may be caused by lymphopenia and cytokine storms. The anti-inflammatory effects of heparin may help prevent or reverse a cytokine storm caused by the virus and thus delay COVID-19 progression and improve overall condition in patients. The pleiotropic effects of heparin may have a greater therapeutic effect than compounds that are directed against a single target, such as an anti-IL-6 therapy. This is because COVID-19 patients commonly have complications such as coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiac pathology that may be mitigated by heparin treatment (Li J, <a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fet.al%3A6aezp-d7g56f8yLXypu0pTCfKjA&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""et.al"">et.al</a>; Wojnicz <a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fet.al%3A6aezp-d7g56f8yLXypu0pTCfKjA&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""et.al"">et.al</a>).</p><p>Limitations<br>This study is limited by a small sample size (n=44) and a single-center design. Double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials of LMWH treatment are needed to understand the possible benefit of the treatment. Additionally, this study was unable to control for the dose and days of treatment of LMWH. Identifying the correct dose and timing of LMWH is a matter of immediate interest. Of note, patients in the heparin group received two types of LMWH, enoxaparin sodium or nadroparin calcium, which have been reported to have differing anticoagulant activity. The use of different LMWHs in the heparin group warrants further explanation.</p><p>Another caveat of this study is that the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products were significantly higher at baseline for patients in the heparin group compared to those in the control group. Therefore, it is difficult to decipher whether some of the positive effects of heparin treatment were due to its anti-coagulation effects or direct anti-inflammatory effects. Future studies are that delineate the anti-inflammatory functions of heparin independently of its anticoagulant properties in cases of COVID-19 would be useful.</p><p>Lastly, this study did not discuss any side-effects of heparin, such as the risk of bleeding. Moreover, coagulation can help to compartmentalize pathogens and reduce their invasion, therefore anticoagulant treatments like heparin may have risks and it remains to be determined which patients would benefit from this therapy.</p><p>References:<br>Li J, Li Y, Yang B, Wang H, Li L.

Just read an article about a theory that Covid-19 binds to hemoglobin, causing the iron ion to be released, thus preventing the hemoglobin to bind with oxygen.

From the cdc summary there were 808,000 total hospitalizations with 61,000 deaths and I remember the flu season was pretty long.  I wonder how the curves for new cases, deaths, hospitalizations and icu use looked.  I remember stories that the hospitals were crowded but I don't remember stories about people dying because there weren't beds or ventilators.</p><p>I know that it's unpopular to compare coronavirus to the flu.  Underestimating a threat is dangerous and could (and maybe did) lead to delay in ramping up testing and beds and ventilators and other necessary medical resources.</p><p>When people were predicting 2,000,000 deaths in the US and then 200,000 deaths I could understand the fears.  But now they're predicting 60,000 deaths and it may end up half of that, so I think it's reasonable to make the comparisons.</p><p>Comparing situations to past situations is usually our best way to understand how to react.  In terms of how contagious and how lethal this epidemic/pandemic is, it now seems that it and the flu are similarly contagious and that covid is much less lethal.  The big difference is that we have a pretty big number of people with significant immunity to the flu while it's likely there was little immunity in our population to covid-19.  If we end up with 200,000,000 people becoming infected but with only 60,000 deaths, then covid was a fifth as lethal as the flu for 2017-2018 with  3 in 10,000 infections dying vs 14 in 10,000 infections dying from the flu.</p><p>However the comparison to the flu can lead to some counter-arguments.  For example, the cdc uses a multiplier of ~80 for estimated current flu infections vs confirmed flu infections.  Applying that to covid-19 means that we have ~500,000 confirmed cases so we would have had 40,000,000 total infections leaving another 160,000,000 to go assuming 60% of the population for herd immunity.  Projecting deaths would mean 17,000 + 68,000 for a total of 85,000.  We'll soon know what that multiplier is for covid-19 because there are a number of antibody surveys going on in the US and internationally.  You can bet that the same thing will happen for the flu next year and we'll have a more accurate estimate of infections and lethality for the flu rather than the current guesstimates.</p><p>A big question is how social distancing will have affected the final number of infections and deaths.  It seems so logical that social distancing will curb infections and deaths, but many suggest that it may end up only prolonging the length of the pandemic while not making a significant difference in total final infections and total final deaths.  The antibody tests may give us the answer to that as well.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752";"2020-04-10";"13:51:26";"2020-04-10T13:51:26";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752v1";"2020.03.27.20043752"

It's here below:</p><p>Corona Virus Disease (COVID) 2019: Comparison of Cases in India and Abroad</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The trends of COVID 19 infections, complications and mortality are similar in almost all the countries, including India.</p><p>Risk of developing severe disease and death is higher in those aged 60+ years, and particularly in those with modern diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease.</p><p>In India, 8.5% of the population is aged 60+ years, and 4-11% of the population aged less than 40 years is afflicted with hypertension and diabetes, and these are vulnerable to severe COVID 19.</p><p>The common factor for increased risk of severe COVID 19 is the presence of the so called metabolic syndrome at any age, old or young. These disorders are related to consumption of sugars and sweets, fruit juices, sweetened beverages, processed and fast foods, fried foods etc., and also alcohol consumption, and smoking. Avoiding these will be helpful in combating COVID 19.</p><p>COVID 19 remains a mild illness in almost 80-90% of those infected, and many patients lesser than 30 years of age are likely to have very mild or no symptoms.</p><p>Details:</p><p>India has already recorded about 5500 cases and more than 160 deaths due to COVID 19.

Considering the fact that 86-90% of the deaths occurred in those who had pre-existing diseases, the higher number of deaths in the 40-60 years age group seen in India is attributable to younger onset of these diseases in Indians. In India, the overall prevalence of hypertension is about 30%, and about 11% in the age group of 40 years or lesser. Type 2 Diabetes has an overall prevalence of 16-19%, whereas in the young, it is about 4-8%.

I am not sure that a test on a representative, random sample of the population would be the best way to get a more meaningful estimation of the total positive cases - but I agree with you on the need of a diffused testing strategy as the only way to understand the actual spread of the disease.<br>Following your explanation, while my previous critiques to the 'statistical' analysis remain valid, I would also like to add that nowhere in the manuscript it is explicitly recommended a strengthening of the testing strategy. The abstract (lines 27-32) explicitly indicates as the scope of the paper a more realistic estimate of the real extension of the infection using the deceased data to obtain a prediction of the total number of infected cases. The following sections of the paper even discuss the use of the deceased number as a quantity with a rather rigorous statistical meaning (line 248) to forecast the evolution of the epidemics in Italy, thus seeming to imply that the number of the deceased is in fact sufficient to make predictions. Only towards the very end of the article (line 436) there is some kind of vague criticism towards the existing testing strategy - which according to your comment is the core concept of the entire work.<br>In other words, it is clear from your additional comment that the intentions behind the work are valid, but the same valid intentions are not clear from the preprint itself, overshadowed by a massive focus on questionable estimates (see my previous comment) on the numbers of the pandemics.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243";"2020-04-09";"19:18:47";"2020-04-09T19:18:47";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046243v1";"2020.03.28.20046243"

Maternal admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation or death were defined as primary outcomes;  secondary study outcomes comprised clinical Covid-19 severity in both mothers and newborns, including development of ARDS, neonatal ICU admission as well as mortality.</p><p>Maternal characteristics and outcome: 3 out of 33 women were in their second trimester of pregnancy (17, 20 and 26 weeks), and 15/33 (45.5%) had a previous history of underlying chronic health disorders including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or nervous system disease. Common Covid-19 symptoms at presentation were fever (63.6%), dry cough (39.4%), fatigue (21.2%), and shortness of breath (21.2%). Less common symptoms included diarrhea, post-partum fever, muscle ache, sore throat and chest pain. 4 (12.1%) pregnant women had no apparent symptoms. The majority of cases were classified as mild (39.4%) or moderate (57.6%); however, one woman developed severe Covid-19. 40.6% of women were diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, 43.8% presented with unilateral pneumonia, and 15.6% showed radiological ground-glass opacity. 87.9% of women required oxygen administration, and one (3%) woman had to be put on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (primary outcome). 81.5% of women had a C-section and only 5% had vaginal deliveries. Obstetrical complications were seen in 22.2% of women, including three cases of preterm rupture of membranes, two cases of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and one case of spontaneous preterm labor. Five pregnancies were ongoing at the end of the observation point of this study; one woman decided to have her pregnancy terminated. Neonatal outcome:  Out of 28 newborns included in this study, 35.7% were born preterm at &lt;37 weeks of gestation with Apgar scores ranging from 8-10/10 at 1 min and from 9-10/10 after 5 min, indicating normal heart and respiratory rates. 17.9% of newborns were of low birth weight (not specified) and 14.3% showed signs of fetal distress (also not specified). According to the authors of this study, none of the newborns presented with clinical Covid-19 symptoms. However, one newborn, delivered at 34 weeks of gestation, was diagnosed with (apparently Covid-19 unrelated?) ARDS and transferred to NICU (secondary outcome). Of 26 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2, only one was found positive and showed radiological signs of pneumonia, but no clinical symptoms of Covid-19. It remains unclear whether this was the same case as the newborn diagnosed with ARDS. The affected newborn did not require any treatment and was discharged at 16 days post birth. In summary, the primary outcome “mechanical ventilation” in pregnant women was rare (3%), no other primary outcomes were reached. Most Covid-19 cases in pregnant women were described as mild to moderate. Only one of 28 (3.57%)  newborns was diagnosed with ARDS (secondary outcome).</p><p><b>Potential limitations</b></p><p>Major limitations of this study are its small size and the rudimentary and at times inadequate description of patient specifics. For example, underlying health conditions that might be affecting Covid-19 outcome in pregnant women should have been clearly specified (other than being of be listed (not just &lt;37 weeks). Given that maternal infection status seemed mostly unknown at the time of birth and, more importantly, that the majority of cases in this study were clinically asymptomatic or mild to moderate, it remains unclear whether the C-sections performed were a medical necessity or elective procedures. This is of importance and should have been discussed. With regard to neonatal outcome, it is also not apparent whether the newborn found to be infected with SARS-CoV2 and the case diagnosed with ARDS were the same individual. If this was the case, it would be incorrect to refer to all newborns as asymptomatic. Additionally, it seems somewhat unlikely that a newborn with a near-perfect Apgar score would present with ARDS immediately after birth. Likewise, any individual diagnosed with ARDS would certainly be expected to receive supportive treatment including (invasive) mechanical ventilation. While it is highly relevant that overall clinical outcome in pregnant women diagnosed with Covid-19 seems better than in SARS or MERS (as discussed by the authors), it nevertheless needs to be stressed that more than 37% of newborns in this study were delivered preterm and that the obstetric complication rate of 22% seems higher than non-Covid-19 average.</p><p><b>Overall relevance for the field</b></p><p>Observations in this study confirm some of the findings published in a case series by Yu N et al. (Lancet Infect Dis 2020; <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2F%3AZwAOIOdU2sSFW4vqnzMbU432G5I&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://doi.org/10.1016/"">https://doi.org/10.1016/</a> S1473-3099(20)30176-6). However, due to the relatively small study size of 33 pregnant women and 28 newborns, this study lacks statistical power and final conclusions on Covid-19 outcomes in pregnant women and newborns cannot be drawn. Yet, the data collected here are important and should be incorporated into larger data sets for more insight. Understanding the clinical course and effects of Covid19 in both pregnant women and newborns is essential, and while there are some recent publications on vertical SARS-CoV2 transmission between mothers and newborns (Dong L et al, JAMA March 26, 2020, doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4621; Zeng H et al, JAMA March 26, 2020, doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4861) as well as on neonatal infection at birth (Zeng L et al, JAMA March 26, 2020, doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.0878), our knowledge of how these patient subsets are affected is still very limited.</p><p><i>This review was undertaken as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20041061";"2020-04-08";"00:15:34";"2020-04-08T00:15:34";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041061v1";"2020.03.22.20041061"

The table provided for randomization doesn't show them either. Having a difference about risk factors could play a huge part in the difference - let's consider that control group had more people with pre-existing conditions, for instance, thus, the risk of evolving to a severe disease would be improved, independently of HCQ. Moreover, there is no mention of whether the four individuals who progressed to severe disease had any pre-existing conditions, needed mechanical ventilation or any other details of the ""severity"" - could it be a SpO2 of 92% only, accordingly to inclusion criteria.</p><p>The paper does not describes clearly the evaluation criteria. How was measured the cough? Was it dicotomic (have cough/don't have any cough)? How could you determine whether the pneumonia ""improved""? Was it accordingly to the presence/absence of infiltrates on X-Rays, or % of lungs compromised in CT-scan? Thus, calculating a significative p value for subjective criteria is really, really a difficult point.</p><p>It does not states, as well, the symptoms duration prior to admission and start of the intervention.

By comparing air quality levels with the spread and mortality of the virus, a significant correlation was found in China, Italy and the United States. People seem to become infected and die more often in those areas affected with poor air quality levels. Although the infection is still ongoing globally, these results are convincing because they are not influenced by different population densities.

And isn't that the very reason that you are testing the associations between the BCG and slope of the increase in the analysis of ""BCG vaccination policy is associated with a lower COVID-19 growth rate""?? <br>They are conceptually essentially the same analyses.Why are you introducing the apparently inadequate analyses using 3 categories of the slope (it loses information) if that is so inadequate and why aren't you intoruducing the analyses of the continuous numerical data, if that is not due to the fact that the later analyses yield insignificant findings.</p><p>3. &gt;&gt;In addition to these two big things, herd immunity is expected to exist.Therefore, considering these 3 factors, the analyses based on ""how long the country has advanced the BCG vaccination measure"" are theoretically inappropriate in testing this hypothesis.</p><p>I think your counterargument is getting more and more bizarre. If the strain of the BCG and the spread of TB is important, and if that is the reason you cannot introduce the analysis of how many years BCG is advanced in that country, for the very same reason, you should not introduce three category analyses (current, past, never). Because that is biased by the strain of BCG and TB. Why are you then introducing 3 category analyses ? and why aren't you introducing the analyses of how many years BCG has been advanced in that country, if that is not due to the fact that the later analyses yeild insignificant findings. <br>I think this is evidence that you are just cherry picking the conceptually apparently inappropriate analyses (that even you yourself admit they are biased according to your counterargument) that support your conclusion and that shouldn't be how things work in science.</p><p>4,  &gt;&gt;For example, even when we restrict the countries from 5000 to 15000 tests per million population, the effect remains.<br>I don't know why you can control the household incomes and you can't do the same analyses that control the number of testing (rather than restricting the countries). It shouldn't be an arbitrary issue.<br>You can easily do both,if the appropriate data of number of testing could be obtained (I heard it was difficult). I think the total inappropriateness of your main analyses are apparent (3 categories of BCG, which is biased according to your opinion, no control on the timing of the spread of the virus which you tried to control in subanalyses, but not in main analyses). It is even out of question, and you yourself admitted that the former is biased, and the latter is acceptable in your subanalysis.</p><p>5, &gt;&gt;Tourists from Asia: How about Japan and Taiwan, that had a lot of tourists from China and still have few patients who died.<br>&gt;&gt;A remarkable difference can be seen between Western Europe and Eastern Europe.<br>Anecdotal evidence doesn't matter.The difference can be easily attributed to the number of tourists.<br>Taiwan and other provinces of China could be robust to the virus, due to the highest alert and vigorous policies and not BCG, all that matter is the statistical test. <br>I couldn't obtain the data of Chinese tourists, so I obtained the number of tourists from UNWTO, and controlled it.<br>The number of tourists in the country is robustly associated with how fast the 100th case was detected after controlling the population (p = 0.001, partial correlation coefficient: -0.434), the number of cases 9 days after the detection of the 100th case (p = 0.009, partial correlation coefficient; 0.345), the number of 10 days after the detection of the 100th case (p = 0.006, partial correlation coefficient: 0.361)<br>And after controlling the population, number of tourists, and</p><p>6, <br>6. Masks: In Asian countries, it might be a factor. However, are there any differences in the percentage of people wearing masks between Western Europe and Eastern Europe? I don't know, but maybe not.<br>7. Food: Could be. But exactly what kind of food can explain this big differences? In case you can think of any particular food that can distinguish Western Europe from Eastern Europe, please let us know.<br>12, The strength of individual rights and freedom (in other words, how strongly the nation can control the individual behaviors).</p><p>The difference of Eastern Europe can western Europe can be easily explained by the number of tourists.<br>If you make a counterargument through cherry picking comparisons, then I also make a cherry picking comparison of ""why on earth Israel which stopped BCG is not yielding number of deaths compared with Iran and Turkey."" ""If Denish strain is not that good why on earth Singapore and Ethiopia are controlling the death?"", ""And in china, why only in Wuhan, were there so many deaths? ""In Korea, why on earth only in Taegu, did the virus spread substantially?""<br> None of them have to be related to BCG. Because many factors apparently affect the spreads of the virus. Please stop sticking the idea that everything is about BCG. It is not and even if BCG works, the difference between particular nations can or cannot be attributed to BCG. So, only the appropriate statistical analyses matter. <br>Nutrients of green tea and soy beans are cited as the potential substances to prevent coronavirus in in vitro preprint (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchsquare.com%2Farticle%2Frs-19560%2Fv1%29%3AA-_gT6h1ofDMENIwsQAtwfEBpDA&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-19560/v1)"">https://www.researchsquare....</a> and green tea  and soy beans are more consumed in Asia. <br>Further, amount of fat one takes also tended to be positively correlated with how fast the 100th case is detected (P = 0.103, partial correlation coefficient -0.231) after controlling the population, GDP and tourists. <br>Yes, you are not able to know many many effects of numerous possible confounding variables that are already shown to potentially prohibit the spread of the virus in various types of ways, that is why this study cannot conclude anything regarding BCG which is stopped in Western countries, through this kind of study.

Subjective feeling of unlikeliness or anecdotal evidence are not how things work in epidemiological studies.</p><p>14, As for TB, after controlling GDP, number of tourists and population, the association between the the number of onset of TB per 100 thousand people in 2018 showed no significant correlation with how fast the 100th case is detected (p = 0.210, partial correlation coefficient, 0.127), the number of cases 9 days after the 100th case (p = 0.472), the number of deaths 9 days after the 100th case (p = 0.744). <br>I couldn't obtain the data of the total past experience of TB in the nation.<br>If you used the same dependent variable (onset in 2018), then the correlations you found were probably due to the inclusion of many developing countries in which the 100th patient has not even been detected (meaning the virus hasn't spread substantially) because few tourists go there and developing countries mostly have TB, regardless of TB has an effect toward the virus or not.<br>As I keep saying, this is why when the virus is spread should be controlled.Without this control, apparent no correlations can result in spurious correlations.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165";"2020-04-07";"17:50:33";"2020-04-07T17:50:33";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165v1";"2020.03.30.20048165"

It should be noted that when analyzing data on such a reduced 'statistical' sample, it is not appropriate to refer to statistical uncertainties - the sample is too small to actually compute statistical errors that have any sense for the analysis. One should instead focus on the analysis of the systematic errors that affect the estimation of IFR in order to obtain the actual relevance of the estimation obtained by simply dividing the number of died passengers for the total number of infected people on board. In other words, since these errors cannot be computed for IFR on the DP, this number should not be used as a benchmark for further analyses. <br>The final estimation of the total number of infected cases is so vague (line 332-333 and line 355-356: between 660 000 and 3 300 000 - a difference of 500%!) that there is no practical use for it.

As a genetic counselor, I started thinking in a genetic linkage type of way and looked to see what was located near ABO blood group genes on chromosome 9. It turns out there is a gene, GBGT1 that sits next to ABO blood group and so this is a relatively conserved haplotype for polymorphisms in those genes. GBGT1 encodes a glycolipid called Forssman glycolic is which is thought in humans to be a major attachment site for pathogen binding to cells. This gene is highly active in lung tissues.

"1243";"4863940646";"tsuyomiyakawa";"tsuyomiyakawa";"<p>Thanks for your comments.<br>1. Three categorical classification is objective, using an objective criteria and non-parametric statistical test. That being said, we are working on this by using better way of analysis. In fact, using ""1st day when the 100th cases were detected"" is not appropriate for testing this hypothesis. Assuming that BCG is protective against the infection, ""1st day when the 100th cases is detected"" is expected to be also delayed, as well as the spread of the virus after the day. In addition, ""100th cases"" needs to be adjusted by population of each country. We have been working on this, since submission of this preprint last week. In our preliminary analyses, significant effect remains after controlling it. We will incorporate it in the next version.<br>2. """"how long the country has advanced the BCG vaccination measure"": In fact, the differences between Group A (Currently having mandatory BCG vaccination) and Group B/C (the countries that terminated or has never had the mandatory BCG vaccination) are not only vaccination policy, but also two more big things. One is the strains of the vaccine. Group B highly tend to have used the strains that have large genomic deletion, compared to group A. Our analyses (not described in the preprint yet) show strong effect of the strains. Another critical difference is that the prevalence of tuberculosis(TB) is very low in Group B/C compared to group A, which is quite natural considering why they don't have BCG mandating policy. One third of world population is reported to have experienced TB , which is a natural bacteria and is expected to stimulate immune system, even greater than vaccine. Most of the TB positive people reside in group A countries. Actually, the effect of TB prevalence seems to be quite strong.<br>In addition to these two big things, herd immunity is expected to exist.<br>Therefore, considering these 3 factors, the analyses based on ""how long the country has advanced the BCG vaccination measure"" are theoretically inappropriate in testing this hypothesis. You suspect ""voodoo correlation. Maybe right, in a sense. It is quite likely that this TB prevalence is the biggest ones behind this apparent correlation, I guess.<br>Sorry that we have not included the data on BCG strains and TB prevalence in this version of the manuscript, but we will incorporate them in the next version.<br>3. GDP: We are using median household income, instead. The significant effect remains after controlling it. In your case, you could not obtain significant effect of BCG, most likely because indices inappropriate for testing the hypothesis were used.<br>4. ""The higher GDP countries can do more tests,"" : We have been testing the effect of the number of tests done per 1 million population. Seems unlikely to explain it. For example, even when we restrict the countries from 5000 to 15000 tests per million population, the effect remains.<br>5. Tourists from Asia: How about Japan and Taiwan, that had a lot of tourists from China and still have few patients who died. A remarkable difference can be seen between Western Europe and Eastern Europe. Do they differ in that sense? Quite unlikely to explain it.<br>6. Masks: In Asian countries, it might be a factor. However, are there any differences in the percentage of people wearing masks between Western Europe and Eastern Europe? I don't know, but maybe not.<br>7. Food: Could be. But exactly what kind of food can explain this big differences? In case you can think of any particular food that can distinguish Western Europe from Eastern Europe, please let us know.<br>8. Temperature: It was evaluated in the preprint and please take a look.<br>9. ""The list of potential confounding variables, as far as I can see is endless and diverse."": It would be great if you can provide us concrete candidates for confounding factors, which could explain this, better than BCG vaccination, its strains and TB prevalence, as we requested in our note in the manuscript.<br>10. How many Chinese?: Again, think about Japan, Taiwan, Korea and so on. Any differences in Eastern and Eastern Europe? Unlikely to explain. However, if you have such ratio data, we can test the hypothesis and please provide such data to us.<br>11. Popularity of religion: This is an interesting possibility, which is worth testing. In islamic countries, I guess that they all have a strong custom to go to Mosque. Are there any difference between Iran and Iraq (they have huge difference in terms of COVID-19) in this regard? I am not familiar but people in African countries may go to church a lot. In Africa, spread of COVID-19 is very slow.<br>12. The strength of individual rights and freedom: Interesting. If you can quantify it, we can test it. But, again, any differences in Western and Eastern Europe?<br>13. The factors related to Western rich countries: One of the most significant things among them I think is the prevalence of TB (, which would have effect on its own and also led to the difference of BCG vaccination policy). Yes, there could be more. Please let us know concrete ones, if you come up to any. We are eager to test any ideas that can explain this huge difference parsimoniously with biological validity, better than the prevalence of TB.<br>14. Diamond princess: You are right, in that Japanese cannot be invincible, especially aged people. Effect of vaccine can wane over long time of period and, in Diamond princess where most of the passengers were aged ones, herd immunity may not work.<br>15. RCT: As we noted in our preprint, large scale clinical studies, in addition to the ones that are currently conducted, are greatly encouraged. In making decision to conduct such studies, we believe that this kind of hypothesis generating research can greatly help. It is preferable that such hypothesis generating studies are conducted as rigorously as possible, within its own limitation as a retrospective epidemiology.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165";"2020-04-06";"23:03:48";"2020-04-06T23:03:48";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165v1";"2020.03.30.20048165"

Authors also compared the sensitivity of RNA and antibody tests over the course of the disease . The key findings are:</p><p>•	Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG were 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively.</p><p>•	The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively.

Comparisons of seroconversion rates between critical and non-critical patients did not reveal any significant differences.</p><p>•	RNA tests had higher sensitivity in early phase and within 7 days of disease onset than antibody assays (66.7% Vs 38.3% respectively).</p><p>•	The sensitivity of the Ab assays was higher 8 days after disease onset, reached  90% at day 13 and 100% at later time points  (15-39 days).   In contrast, RNA was only detectable in 45.5% of samples at days 15-39.</p><p>•	In patients with undetectable RNA in nasal samples collected during day 1-3, day 4-7, day 8-14 and day 15-39 since disease onset,  28.6% (2/7), 53.6% (15/28), 98.2% (56/57) and 100% (30/30) had detectable  total Ab titers  respectively Combining RNA  and antibody tests significantly raised the sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 patients in different stages of the disease (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>•	There was a strong positive correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer 2-weeks after illness onset.</p><p>•	Dynamic profiling of viral RNA and antibodies in representative COVID-19 patients (n=9) since onset of disease revealed that antibodies may not be sufficient to clear the virus.

"1263";"4863601801";"sinaiimmunologyreviewproject";"Sinai Immunol Review Project";"<p>Main Findings:  Currently, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection entirely depends on the detection of viral RNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. False negative results are common, particularly when the samples are collected from upper respiratory. Serological detection may be useful as an additional testing strategy. In this study the authors reported that a typical acute antibody response was induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was discuss earlier1. The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker was total antibody followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days-post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10- and 12-days post-onset (d.p.o). Seroconversion was first detected at day 7d.p.e in 98.9% of the patients. Interestingly they found that viral load declined as antibody levels increased. This was in contrast to a previous study1, showing that increased antibody titers did not always correlate with RNA clearance (low number of patient sample).</p><p>Limitations:   Current knowledge of the antibody response to SAR-CoV-2 infection and its mechanism is not yet well elucidated. Similar to the RNA test, the absence of antibody titers in the early stage of illness could not exclude the possibility of infection.  A diagnostic test, which is the aim of the authors, would not be useful at the early time points of infection but it could be used to screen asymptomatic patients or patients with mild disease at later times after exposure.</p><p>Relevance: Understanding the antibody responses against SARS-CoV2 is useful in the development of a serological test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This manuscript discussed acute antibody responses which can be deducted in plasma   for diagnostic as well as prognostic purposes. Thus, patient-derived plasma with known antibody titers may be used therapeutically for treating COVID-19 patients with severe illness.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>1.

We gave up, cannot clearly identify cause. Most doctors certifying cause of death do not know what caused it, if from SUD. Most people age 65 and over have two or more SUD. Seven thousand people with SUD die each day in the United States.</p><p>People have touted various rate of death from the C-19 flu in America, starting with 4.5% and reducing quickly to current 1.29%. There will be many more deaths from the current infected.</p><p>These death rates are grossly overstated – every pandemic, it is the same thing – death rates are wildly overstated at the beginning. A calculation, using a better basis, is 0.73% -<br>more than the ordinary flu, but not 1.3% or 4.5%</p><p>Truer denominator: in all but Iceland and Pacific Princess, we need to multiply the total cases by four. Why? Because we are only testing a segment of symptomatic cases (coughing, etc), but the asymptomatic cases are 80% of the total. Except for Iceland - they tested a large group drawn from the general population, not just the ones showing<br>symptoms, found 75% asymptomatic (multiply denominator by factor of four). The<br>Pacific Princess tested all 2500 on boat – the Pacific Princess 1% death rate<br>is highly affected by median age of cruise passengers, in general, of 60 to 69<br>years. Diamond Princess has asymptomatic 83% - multiply by five</p><p>Truer numerator, is much less than the reported deaths, we would estimate about 0.2 of the 81% of deaths who have ""SUD"" - serious underlying disease; and 1.0 for all others. We estimate a weighted multiplier as (.2 deaths x 1.0 + .8 deaths x 0.2 = .36 of deaths<br>reported). Why? Because many die from pneumonia in the USA each year, typically as the final stage of some other SUD (per NCHS). Doctors cannot prove a death from someone having the C-19 flu is CAUSED BY the C-19 flu, rather than the person with C-19 flu died WITH the C-19 flu. Needs research, but impossible to split causes. Reported deaths of<br>person WITH C-19 flu now are 100% ascribed to C-19 flu currently.</p><p>In USA, a truer estimate of the<br>actual death rate is therefore, at April 5, 0.73%:</p><p>Numerator: 8173 deaths x .36 = 2942<br>deaths FROM C-19 flu – multiply this times 3 for future deaths from this<br>cohort equals 8826 - divided by -  Denominator:<br>301147 cases x 4 = 1204558 to include asymptomatic – yep, the current number of<br>cases is four times the reported numbers. This is very good news, because it<br>reduces the mortality rate.</p><p>Twelve months from now, we can look<br>at the total deaths in the USA, and compare that with the 2.8 million deaths<br>for 2018. 2.6 million of 2018 deaths were from about seven serious<br>underlying diseases, many people having three or more suds.</p><p>Equals 0.73% truer death rate...more<br>than 0.12% from ordinary flu, but well below 1.29%</p><p>The C-19 flu is just a flu. <br>The C-19 flu is just a flu <br>The C-19 flu is just a flu</p><p>Pete A</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994";"2020-04-06";"16:47:11";"2020-04-06T16:47:11";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994v3";"2020.03.18.20037994"

They found that symptoms that were mostly consistent among studies were sore throat, headache, diarrhea and rhinorrhea. Fever, cough, malaise and muscle pain were highly variable across studies. Leukopenia (mostly lymphocytopenia) and increased white blood cells were highly variable across studies. They identified three most common patterns seen on CT scan, but there was high variability across studies.

In order to characterize the cause and process of lymphocyte depletion in COVID-19 patients, the authors performed gross anatomical and in situ immune-histochemical analyses of spleens and lymph nodes (hilar and subscapular) obtained from post-mortem autopsies of 6 patients with confirmed positive viremia and 3 healthy controls (deceased due to vehicle accidents).</p><p>Primary gross observations noted significant splenic and LN atrophy, hemorrhaging, and necrosis with congestion of interstitial blood vessels and large accumulation of mononuclear cells and massive lymphocyte death. They found that CD68+ CD169+ cells in the spleens, hilar and subscapular LN, and capillaries of these secondary lymphoid organs expressed the ACE2 receptor and stain positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) antigen, while CD3+ T cells and B220+ B cells lacked both the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen. ACE2+ NP+ CD169+ macrophages were positioned in the splenic marginal zone (MZ) and in the marginal sinuses of LN, which suggests that these macrophages were positioned to encounter invading pathogens first and may contribute to virus dissemination.</p><p>Since SARS-CoV-2 does not directly infect lymphocytes, the authors hypothesized that the NP+ CD169+ macrophages are responsible for persistent activation of lymphocytes via Fas::FasL interactions that would mediate activation-induced cell death (AICD). Indeed, the expression of Fas was significantly higher in virus-infected tissue than that of healthy controls, and TUNEL staining showed significant lymphocytic apoptosis. Since pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α can also engage cellular apoptosis and necrosis, the authors interrogated the cytokine expression of the secondary lymphoid organs from COVID-19 patients; IL-6, not TNF-α, was elevated in virus-infected splenic and lymph node tissues, compared to those of healthy controls, and immunofluorescent staining showed that IL-6 is primarily produced by the infected macrophages. In vitro infection of THP1 cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein resulted in selectively increased Il6 expression, as opposed to Il1b and Tnfa transcription. Collectively, the authors concluded that a combination of Fas up-regulation and IL-6 production by NP+ CD169+ macrophages induce AICD in lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs, resulting in lymphocytopenia.</p><p>In summary, this study reports that CD169+ macrophages in the splenic MZ, subscapular LN, and the lining capillaries of the secondary lymphoid tissues express ACE2 and are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings point to the potential role of these macrophages in viral dissemination, immunopathology of these secondary lymphoid organs, hyperinflammation and lymphopenia.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br><i>Technical</i><br>A notable technical limitation is the small number of samples (n=6); moreover, the analysis of these samples using multiplexed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence do not necessarily provide the depth of unbiased interrogation needed to better identify the cell types involved.</p><p><i>Biological</i><br>The available literature and ongoing unpublished studies, including single-cell experiments of spleen and LN from organ donors, do not indicate that ACE2 is expressed by macrophages; however, it remains possible that ACE2 expression may be triggered by type I IFN in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 NP staining of the macrophages does not necessarily reflect direct infection of these macrophages; instead, positive staining only indicates that these macrophages carry SARS-CoV-2 NP as antigen cargo, which may have been phagocytosed. Direct viral culture of macrophages isolated from the secondary lymphoid organs with SARS-CoV-2 is required to confirm the potential for direct infection of macrophages by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, it is important to note that the low to negligible viremia reported in COVID-19 patients to-date does not favor a dissemination route via the blood, as suggested by this study, which would be necessary to explain the presence of virally infected cells in the spleen.</p><p><u>Relevance</u><br>Excess inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by cytokine storm in many COVID-19 patients. The contribution of this pathology to the overall fatality rate due to COVID-19, not even necessarily directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, is significant. A better understanding of the full effect and source of some of these major cytokines, like IL-6, as well as the deficient immune responses, like lymphocytopenia, is urgently needed. In this study, the authors report severe tissue damage in spleens and lymph nodes of COVID-19 patients and identify the role that CD169+ macrophages may play in the hyperinflammation and lymphocytopenia that are both characteristic of the disease. It may, therefore, be important to note the effects that IL-6 inhibitors like Tocilizumab and Sarilumab may specifically have on splenic and LN function. It is important to note that similar observations of severe splenic and LN necrosis and inflammation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 further support the potential importance and relevance of this study.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427";"2020-04-06";"11:57:49";"2020-04-06T11:57:49";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045427v1";"2020.03.27.20045427"

The positive ratio was 78.95% (105/133) in IgM antibody test (SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kit from YHLO Biotech) and 68.42% (91/133) in RT-PCR (SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab/N qPCR detection kit). There were no differences in the sensitivity of SARS-CO-V2 diagnosis in patients grouped according to disease severity. For example, IgG responses were detected in 93.18% of moderate cases, 100% of severe cases and 97.3% of critical cases. In sum, positive ratios were higher in antibody testing compared to RT-PCR detection, demonstrating a higher detection sensitivity of IgM-IgG testing for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms.<br><b>Limitations of the study:</b><br>This analysis only included one-time point of 133 hospitalized patients, and the time from symptom onset was not described. There was no discussion about specificity of the tests and no healthy controls were included. It would be important to perform similar studies with more patients, including younger age groups and patients with mild symptoms as well as asymptomatic individuals. It is critical to determine how early after infection/symptom onset antibodies can be detected and the duration of this immune response.<br><b>Relevance:</b><br>The IgM-IgG combined testing is important to improve clinical sensitivity and diagnose COVID-19 patients. The combined antibody test shows higher sensitivity than individual IgM and IgG tests or nucleic acid-based methods, at least in patients hospitalized with symptoms.  <br><i>Review by Erica Dalla as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.28.20045765";"2020-04-05";"19:18:00";"2020-04-05T19:18:00";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.28.20045765v1";"2020.03.28.20045765"

Given that asymptomatic and undocumented carriers escape public health surveillance systems, a better mathematical model of transmission is needed to determine a more accurate estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0) of the virus to assess the contagiousness of virus. The authors developed a SEYAR dynamical model for transmission of the new coronavirus that takes into account asymptomatic and undocumented carriers. The model was validated using data reported from thirteen countries during the first three weeks of community transmission. While current studies estimate R0 to be around 3, this model indicates that the value could range between 5.5 to 25.4.</p><p><b>Critical analysis: </b>The SEYAR model realistically depicts transmission of the virus only during the initial stages of the disease. More data is necessary to better fit the model with current trends. In addition, multiple factors (e.g. behavioral patterns, surveillance capabilities, environmental and socioeconomic factors) affect transmission of the virus and so, these factors must be taken into consideration when estimating the R0.</p><p><b>Significance: </b>Public health authorities use the basic reproductive number to determine the severity of disease. An accurate estimate of R0 will inform intervention strategies. This model can be applied to different locations to assess the potential impact of COVID-19.</p><p><i>Review by Tamar Plitt as part of a project of students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994";"2020-04-05";"15:51:35";"2020-04-05T15:51:35";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20037994v3";"2020.03.18.20037994"

Across all test subjects, ACE-2 gene expression was also highly correlated with decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), which may explain the increased COVID-19 disease severity in COPD patients. Former smokers were also found to show decreased ACE2 expression relative to current smokers and had no significant difference when compared to non-smokers.</p><p>Limitations: While the upregulation of ACE-2 is an interesting hypothesis for COVID-19 disease severity in COPD patients, this study leaves many more unanswered questions than it addresses. Further studies are required to show whether the specific cell type isolated in these studies is relevant to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Furthermore, there is no attempt to show whether that increased ACE-2 expression contributes to greater disease severity. Does the increased ACE-2 expression lead to greater infectivity with SARS-CoV-2? There is no mechanistic explanation for why ACE-2 levels are increased in COPD patients. The authors could also have considered the impact of co-morbidities and interventions such as corticosteroids or bronchodilators on ACE-2 expression. Finally, given the extensive sequencing performed, the authors could have conducted significantly more in-depth analyses into gene signature differences.</p><p>Importance and implications: This study attempts to address an important clinical finding that both smokers and COPD patients show increased mortality from COVID-19. The novel finding that ACE-2 expression is induced in smokers and COPD patients suggests not only a mechanism for the clinical observation, but also highlights the potential benefit of smoking cessation in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 disease.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.18.20038455";"2020-04-04";"23:54:42";"2020-04-04T23:54:42";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20038455v1";"2020.03.18.20038455"

Two patients had never received anti-viral therapy before (=naïve), whereas nine patients were on Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment before switching to Danoprevir/Ritonavir (=experienced). The age ranged from 18 to 66yo.<br>Naïve patients that received Danoprevir/Ritonavir treatment had a decreased hospitalization time. Patients treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir  did not have a negative PCR test, while after switching to Danoprevir/Ritonavir treatment, the first negative PCR test occurred at a median of two days.</p><p><b>Limitations:</b><br>The results of the study are very hard to interpret as there is no control group not receiving Danoprevir/Ritonavir treatment. This was especially true in naïve patients who seemed to have more mild symptoms before the start of the study and were younger (18 and 44yo) compared to the experienced patients (18 to 66yo).  The possibility that the patients would have recovered without Danoprevir/Ritonavir treatment cannot be excluded.</p><p><b>Relevance:</b><br>The authors of the study treated patients with Danoprevir, with the rational to that this is an approved and well tolerated drug for HCV patients [2], and that it could also target the protease from SARS-CoV-2 (essential for viral replication and transcription). Indeed, homology modelling data indicated that HCV protease inhibitors have the highest binding affinity to Sars-Cov2 protease among other approved drugs [3]. <br>While this study shows that the combination of Danoprevir and Ritonavir might be beneficial for Covid-19 patients, additional clinical trials with more patients and with better methodology (randomization and control group) are needed to make further conclusions.</p><p>1.

In general, the trend has been to switch to only one dose of vaccination, usually in the first few days/weeks of life - but, because it's a trend, it means the switch had to happened at some point - and it was rather recent. And of course it's different in different countries, something which should be probably taken into account. I can give you the info for Poland - the switch happened in 1996, before, children had been vaccinated until about 8-9 years old to make the resistance stronger. With the scarring and all that jazz. It shaped the whole... I don't know how to call it... behaviour in children groups at this age, with the classic slogan ""Don't hit the vaccination [spot]"" in all children games and guidelines how to act around the post-vaccination spot etc..

They used gene expression data publicly available from GEO that included lung tissues, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or SARS-Cov infected cells.</p><p>The authors found no significant differences in ACE2 expression in lung tissues of Healthy, COPD, and Asthma groups (p=0.85); or in BAL of Healthy and COPD (p=0.48); or in epithelial brushings of Healthy and Mild/Moderate/Severe Asthma (p=0.99). ACE2 was higher in the small airway epithelium of long-term smokers vs non-smokers (p&lt;0.001). Consistently, there was a trend of higher ACE2 expression in the bronchial airway epithelial cells 24h post-acute smoking exposure (p=0.073). Increasing ACE2 expression at 24h and 48h compared to 12h post SARS-Cov infection (p=0.026; n=3 at each time point) was also detected.</p><p>15 lung samples’ data from healthy participants were separated into high and low ACE2 expression groups. “High” ACE2 expression was associated with the following GO pathways: innate and adaptive immune responses, B cell mediated immunity, cytokine secretion, and IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8 cytokines. The authors speculate that a high basal ACE2 expression will increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.</p><p>In 3 samples SARS-Cov infection was associated with IL-1, IL-10 and IL-6 cytokine production (GO pathways) at 24h. And later, at 48h, with T-cell activation and T-cell cytokine production. It is unclear whether those changes were statistically significant.</p><p>The authors describe a time course quantification of immune infiltrates in epithelial cells infected with SARS-Cov infection. They state that in healthy donors ACE2 expression did not correlate with the immune cell infiltration. However, in SARS-Cov samples, at 48h they found that ACE2 correlated with neutrophils, NK-, Th17-, Th2-, Th1- cells, and DCs. Again, while authors claim significance, the corresponding correlation coefficients and p-values are not presented in the text or figures. In addition, the source of the data for this analysis is not clear.</p><p>Using network analysis, proteins SRC, FN1, MAPK3, LYN, MBP, NLRC4, NLRP1 and PRKCD were found to be central (Hub proteins) in the regulating network of cytokine secretion after coronavirus infection. Authors conclude this indicates that these molecules were critically important in ACE2-induced inflammatory response. Additionally, authors speculate that the increased expression of ACE2 affected RPS3 and SRC, which were the two hub genes involved in viral replication and inflammatory response.</p><p>LIMITATIONS: The methods section is very limited and does not describe any of the statistical analyses; and description of the construction of the regulatory protein networks is also limited. For the findings in Figures 2 authors claim significance, which is not supported by p-values or coefficients. For the sample selection, would be useful if sample sizes and some of the patients’ demographics (e.g. age) were described. <br>For the analysis of high vs low ACE2 expression in healthy subjects, it is not clear what was the cut off for ‘high’ expression and how it was determined. Additionally, further laboratory studies are warranted to confirm that high ACE2 gene expression would have high correlation with the amount of ACE2 protein on cell surface. For the GO pathway analysis significance was set at p&lt;0.05, but not adjusted for multiple comparisons. <br>There were no samples with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While SARS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 to enter the host cells, the analysis only included data on SARS-Cov and any conclusions about SARS-CoV2 are limited.</p><p>Upon checking GSE accession numbers of the datasets references, two might not be cited correctly:  GSE37758 (“A spergillus niger: Control (fructose) vs. steam-exploded sugarcane induction (SEB)” was used in this paper as “lung tissue” data) and GSE14700 (“Steroid Pretreatment of Organ Donors to Prevent Postischemic Renal Allograft Failure: A Randomized, Controlled Trial” – was used as SARS-Cov infection data).</p><p><i>This review was undertaken as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206";"2020-04-03";"21:24:44";"2020-04-03T21:24:44";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206v1";"2020.02.03.20020206"

The greater problem in the UK is the management-by-fear that prevails in the healthcare system. There will almost certainly be clinical/biomedical scientists who <i>want</i> to validate alternative assays &amp; who know how to, but feel unable to speak up. If they do speak up about the need for fallback assays, they're implicitly drawing attention to the failure of the suits to address this problem previously. The suits, being deeply paranoid about anything that jeopardises their right to be incompetent, will then lash out viciously. (Remember the jet-lagged medical staff, returning from Sierra Leone, who were scapegoated for PHE's botched ebola screening operation at Heathrow airport in Dec 2014?

I don't know if there's enough GeneReleaser in the manufacturer's &amp; distributors' warehouses to help with the shortages, but it might help with throughput since it's quick.

Severe COVID-19 complications often include acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br>The authors analyse clinical and laboratory findings in 40 COVID-19 patients: 13 required mechanical ventilation, and 27 did not. Age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score (mortality prediction score upon sepsis) did not discriminate between<br>both groups. However, all patients requiring intubation were male, and the pulse as well as several laboratory parameters correlated with the risk of respiratory failure. The strongest correlation was found to be with serological IL-6. Elevated IL-6 was found to be associated  with the risk of respiratory failure by a factor of 22.</p><p>Critical analysis:<br>The value of 80pg/mL of IL-6 was identified as decisive, as 92% of patients who reached this cut-off required intubation 0-4 days afterwards. The study must be extended to a larger cohort, however, to perhaps identify a more precise cut-off.<br>Moreover, the causality between IL-6 and respiratory distress remains unclear. Understanding the mechanisms behind these correlations could pinpoint new therapies to prevent respiratory failure.</p><p>Relevance to current epidemic:<br>Foreseeing respiratory distress at an early stage in admitted COVID-19  patients could allow hospitals to better manage their resources, both human and material.</p><p>By Maria Kuksin</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.01.20047381";"2020-04-11";"15:25:20";"2020-04-11T15:25:20";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047381v2";"2020.04.01.20047381"

Total GDP (not GDP per capita) and the number of tourists have a close relationship (r = 0.82). <br>The date when the 100th case was detected show more robust relationship with the BCG policy (currently performed or not), but after the correction of abovementioned covariates, this association also became insignificant )(p= 0.167). But this kind of relationship with the date of 100th case is seen in the case of variables that are specifically associated with Western countries, such as the consumption of wine)(the consumption of wine per capita shows robust association with the date of the 100th case after correction of population (p  = 0.0002, more wine, the faster the detection of 100th case). <br>So, my guess is that this spurious correlation mainly came from the fact the countries which abandaned BCG policies are more developed and more popular from tourists (which increased the faster and more and multiple spread of the virus) and also show greater aging (which increased the risk) and also they locate in western countries which were confident of their medical system and which were away from Asia and which were less alert to this infectious disease from China. The habit of wearing mask, hug, handshake or religious ceremonies might affect, too. <br>In the cruise ship Diamond Princess, Japanese who were put in the same ship with Westerners show greater mortality rate than Westerners.

"1623";"4871322885";"clive_bates";"Clive Bates";"<p>Thank you for an extremely interesting and informative paper.  I have a few suggestions about one aspect of the paper - tobacco use.</p><p>1. The paper alternates between use of 'smoking status' (the body) and 'tobacco use' (tables). It would be helpful to know which is appropriate and how the data on tobacco status was gathered.  Tobacco use could include smokeless tobacco and, if FDA definitions are applied, it could include vaping.</p><p>2. The proportion of tobacco users assessed, hospitalised and developing critical conditions is substantially below the tobacco use prevalence for New York, even when age is considered. Is this worth mentioning?</p><p>3. The multivariate analysis shows <i>an apparent protective effect</i> against hospitalisation for current and former tobacco use as reported (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.57-0.87 p=0.001). This is a striking finding, but consistent with findings from CDC's summary of US data (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F69%2Fwr%2Fmm6913e2.htm%3A-hgsj8IEdm2fggPArnD0mYN5uS8&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e2.htm"">MMWR (April 3, 2020 / 69(13);382–386)</a>) and China (<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qeios.com%2Fread%2Farticle%2F561%3Arztprl8WbneM-mIj5tafaAkLxWM&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.qeios.com/read/article/561"">Farsalinos et al - pre-print</a>) in which smoking appears to be underrepresented in the population with progression to more severe symptoms.</p><p>4. A weaker (non-significant) apparent protective effect of current or former tobacco use (OR = 0.89 95% CI 0.65-1.21, P=0.452) of was found in the progression from hospitalisation to critical condition. Hospitals generally impose smoking cessation and nicotine withdrawal at the point of hospitalisation.</p><p>5. Would it be possible for the authors to rerun the multivariate analysis with current tobacco use and former tobacco use as separate variables?  It is possible that former use is masking a stronger effect from current use. Current and former tobacco use may have quite different effects on progression of the disease and former use can include people who quit smoking decades ago. The merging of current and former tobacco use may be obscuring valuable information in the data.</p><p>6. There are many possible explanations for an <i>apparent</i> protective effect.  It is possible the tobacco use status has been underreported, or current and former users are overrepresented in the 'unknown' status. It is possible that patients fear disclosure of tobacco use will lead to discrimination in treatment or they may feel guilty about their 'contributory negligence'.  However, it is also possible that there is a real protective effect from either smoking or nicotine use.  This is not implausible: nicotine interacts with the same receptor that is responsible for development of the disease following exposure to the virus.  This paper could yield useful supportive or falsifying insights into that hypothesis.</p><p>7. Even if such findings are disconcerting, we should be led by the data. <i>It is not possible to rule out a protective effect at this point and this paper adds to the reasons to take the idea seriously.</i> There could be significant implications for the population impact of COVID-19, implications for advice to tobacco users, and implications for practice in hospitals.</p><p>8. I have no conflicts of interest with respect to tobacco, nicotine or pharmaceutical industries.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794";"2020-04-12";"12:44:15";"2020-04-12T12:44:15";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794v1";"2020.04.08.20057794"

Central Air units suck up a huge amount of dust and some of it makes it through the filters and back out into the air.</p><p>Of course none of this  means the moisture in exhalations or coughs couldn't also be the vehicle. On the whole it would seem not to be spreading enough for normal exhalations to be the primary vehicle, although it seems from the Washington choir episode that with enough force behind the exhalations, it could be.</p><p>I am sorry if this question about dust seems amateurish or crackpot.

This article came to my attention because, even if it has not been peer-reviewed yet, has already been referenced in a press release of Italy's central health agency (ISS), which comments the results as a matter of fact and calls them ""published"".</p><p>Skimming the full text the following points came to my attention.</p><p>1 - On page 4, you state that ""Due to the high concordance (99%) among confirmation results with the engaged laboratories, thepolicy was then changed allowing selected Regions with demonstrated confirmation capacity to directly confirm COVID-19  cases (17)."" Reference 17 contains only an internal note specifying what a ""case"" is, but does not contain the data supporting the statement that there is high concordance. Previous publications coming from ISS (e.g. [1]) state that ""99% of the samples analized by the national reference lab of ISS result POSITIVE"", which suggests a selection bias in sending samples to the central laboratory and completely invalidates the confirmation process. False positive/false negative rates of the cross-analysis has not been reported.</p><p>2 - In your introduction, you state that ""extensive contact tracing and testing of close contacts unveiled ongoing transmission in several municipalities of the Lombardia region"". The difficulties in testing and tracking cases in Lombardia region is well known, with several papers (including your references) and statements from authorities highlighting the fact that (a) the number of tested people is little w.r.t. the number of potential cases; (b) the classification of potential case varies on a regional basis, and a potential case in any other Italian region might not qualify as a potential case in Lombardia region, thus not getting tested; (c) testing protocols in Lombardia region do not include the testing of people living within the same household of the confirmed case, thus it is unclear in which way the contact tracing has been ""extensive""; (d) the delay between the collection of the swab and the communication of the result is long and with a high variance. All these facts shall be taken into account when analyzing statistical data.</p><p>3 - In your conclusions (!), you state that ""Further, we observe that as of March 8 2020, the Rt it is still abovethe epidemic threshold. The progressively harsh physical distancing measures enacted since then may have enhanced the decreasing trend in transmissibility as happened in China"". You support this statement using a paper which analyses the transmission of Ebola in West Africa. This seems to me like a political statement which shall have no place in a scientific paper, let alone on its conclusions. You have no data to back this statement, since your analysis terminates on the 12th of March, i.e. three days later of the enacment of the lockdown. You even show that there is a decreasing trend in R_t starting in the last decade of February, which puts the R_t at the beginning of the national lockdown slightly above 1 with a strongly declining trend. While writing this sentence has no scientific value, of course, it allows the MoH and ISS to defend their decision-making because ""science said that"".</p><p>I do not have the specific background to carry out a review of the quantitative data, but I cannot ignore the use of poorly-backed statements to dignify as ""science"" what are only political decisions. Unsurprisingly, these statements are those which will fit into press releases and official statements.</p><p>[1] <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicentro.iss.it%2Fcoronavirus%2Fbollettino%2FInfografica_21marzo%2520ITA.pdf%3ASQU0LYKAKTtCTDgn8_ZUi6Ed0ig&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Infografica_21marzo%20ITA.pdf"">https://www.epicentro.iss.i...</a></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.08.20056861";"2020-04-14";"11:29:44";"2020-04-14T11:29:44";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20056861v1";"2020.04.08.20056861"

Often smoking rate in 65+ is well below the national average. In the US ~14% is the smoking prevalence whereas 8.4% for 65+, in the UK ~16.5% is the national smoking prevalence whereas 10% 65+ (figures from CDC and ONS). Life Smokers die younger or likely to have comorbidities especially if they have smoked. Combines with other factors e.g under reporting and other mentioned already in the comment. Finally the effect size may be further attenuated by air pollution often severe in cities where most Covid-19 cases are found.

Therefore this study investigated the possible correlation between COVID-19 death cases or prevalence with BCG vaccination. The authors used publicly available COVID-19 data from 136 countries as well as  vaccination demographics from the BCG World Atlas to perform a linear regression modeling.</p><p>After correcting for life expectancy and the onset of the spread of the virus (n=40), the analyses revealed a positive effect of current BCG vaccination programs and controlling the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.</p><p>The amount of variance explained by BCG vaccination was 20% for number of cases and significant for both groups of countries, the ones that used to have a BCG immunization program in the past (b = 0.6122, p = .0024) and the ones that never have it (b = 0.6511, p = .0326).</p><p>Only the group of countries that never vaccinated against BCG showed significance in deaths/cases ratio but explains only 3.39% of the observed variance.</p><p>The authors concluded that BCG immunization may provide protection against COVID-19 probably due to the infection spread reduction. BCG immunization doesn’t have a significant impact in the mortality induced by COVID-19.</p><p>Limitations:<br>As acknowledged by the authors of this study, there are large number of unexplained potential confounding variables such as BCG immunization coverage, and onset of virus spread in different countries. <br>The authors cite that BCG immunization coverage could be variable among countries, but they didn’t explore it. Further, vaccination coverage changes at different rates over time across countries for different reasons [2]. Additionally, the authors did not consider the variable immunization coverage within countries, where unequal access to healthcare is frequently observed [3, 4]. <br>The authors do not adequately control for time of spread in infection for each country [5].</p><p>The authors discuss the importance of validating experimentally the results observed and claim that BCG vaccination could provide non-specific protection against COVID-19. A stronger discussion of the use of BCG vaccine would have included known considerations on efficacy considering route of administration (intravenous, intradermal), vaccine strains which are known to differ in the number of viable bacteria and duration of protection.</p><p>Relevance: <br>This study presented preliminary data on possible non-specific protection by BCG immunization on COVID-19 infection.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

Upon admission, patients were assessed with an APACHE II score (mortality risk) and SOFA score (organ system dysfunction). Among other clinical parameters, including lymphocyte count, CRP, and enzyme levels, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was most positively correlated with APACHE II and SOFA. Additionally, strong positive correlations were found between LDH and observational assessment of severity of pneumonia and of underlying coronary disease. Notably, serum LDH was also positively correlated with other univariate parameters, including troponin and CRP. Meanwhile, LDH was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count across different subsets, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.</p><p><u>Limitations</u><br>Several studies have previously identified serum LDH as a predictive biomarker for COVID-19 progression (see references). Therefore, it is important to note that while LDH correlates with disease severity, it does not suffice as a reason for severe disease, so whether it serves as a robust predictive factor is not thoroughly supported; an explanation is still needed between the release of LDH from infected cells and disease severity.</p><p><u>Significance</u><br>The identification of serum LDH as a predictive biomarker does glean insight into possible links between its release into the circulation and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. It is important to note that LDH release itself requires significant damage to and permeabilization of plasma membranes, leading to necrotic cell death. Therefore, this report, and others like it, should warrant investigation into the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential necrosis or pyroptosis of infected host cells. It is important to note that previous studies concerning biomarkers for SARS-CoV-1 disease have also identified serum LDH as an important correlative factor with disease severity1. And subsequent investigations have studied the activation of inflammasome structures involved in pyroptosis in the presence of SARS-CoV2-3.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.24.20040162";"2020-04-14";"00:10:20";"2020-04-14T00:10:20";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20040162v1";"2020.03.24.20040162"

Given the potential world importance of this trial everyone should be trying to offer constructive suggestions for its greater acceptability rather than exercising their brains on ways in which mistakes might have been made.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758";"2020-04-13";"14:09:18";"2020-04-13T14:09:18";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3";"2020.03.22.20040758"

A flip-side is that there may be risks to occupational health from accurate manuscripts that, never-the-less, may be taken out of context by policy makers and employers keen to reboot economies and businesses after perceived peaks in the local epidemic curves of Covid-19.</p><p>I worry that one of the main messages conveyed in the abstract of your manuscript, i.e., that the absolute risk of death from Covid-19 among individuals aged &lt;65 years is low, and consistent with risks encountered on the roads, may be mis-applied in occupational settings as the “lockdown” is relaxed. Workers aged 40-64 years, an age-group in which your manuscript recognises that most of the deaths under age 65 occur, may be exposed to higher risks of Covid-19 related death in occupational settings with increased social mixing, compared to the rather theoretical diluted risks estimated across the entire population.</p><p>I entirely understand the reason why your manuscript uses a binary age classification at 65, and note that the first paragraph of the discussion section of the manuscript mentions the concentration of deaths at ages 40-64. However, this is omitted from the abstract, no doubt for reasons of word count, and so may be overlooked by time-pressed readers keen to learn lessons for policy and employment practice. Also, it would be helpful to make the rather obvious point that numbers dying equals fatality rate x numbers infected, and that whilst numbers infected may be low across when averaged across entire populations, infections cluster, and this includes occupational settings.</p><p>So, good paper, but please consider some caution in how your message is conveyed. I speak as someone with relatives, and patients among the key workers soon to be re-mobilised.</p><p>Kind regards<br>Mark Upton</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361";"2020-04-13";"12:12:59";"2020-04-13T12:12:59";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1";"2020.04.05.20054361"

This reduction correlated with increased levels of IL-16, IL-10 and TNF-alpha in sera. They propose that increased expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 observed in these patients are indicative of T cell exhaustion. The observation that there is a dramatic reduction in T cells warrant further study. However, the data does not support that T cell exhaustion is involved. A technical concern is the panel of antibodies selected for the flow cytometric analysis. The authors employed two antibodies that were conjugated to bright fluorochromes (APC and PE) to identify CD8 molecule, which show a high expression on CD8+ T cells. However, to identify TIM3 (a less expressed antigen) they used FITC, which is a dim fluorochrome. No mention is made regarding what fluorochrome was used to discriminate viable cells nor the number of events acquired.</p><p>The phenomenon of exhaustion is antigen-specific, it is characterized by  poor effector functions, sustained coinhibitory receptor expression, along with a distinct transcriptional state (Pauken and Wherry 2015). As opposed by the data reported by Dia et who show that total number of T cells are reduced, which suggest that COVID-19 induces T cell death in an antigen-independent manner. As it was mentioned before, the group COVID-19 patients and of healthy donors is small and is not age-controlled. PD-1 and TIM-3 coexpression should have been evaluated, as these markers might be expressed in different T cell subsets. In addition, Figure 3 shows that CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients expressed TIM-3 in a low percentage of cells (&lt;1%). Thus, PD-1 expression might be dysregulated as consequence of the disease, the cytokine storm, or as mechanism that tries to limit the immunopathology observed in these patients.</p>";"10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364";"2020-04-12";"19:24:42";"2020-04-12T19:24:42";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364v1";"2020.02.18.20024364"

After all, time is the single most important factor for the number of cases for most of the countries in the model. The model is only log(cases) ~ population + temperature. But for example, in half a month's time, population and temperature won't change much, while the number of cases could increase several fold for some countries. Time is a critical factor to model and is more important than temperature and population. Not including time, the model in the paper cannot be stable. Basically as time changes, your conclusions likely will change.</p><p>2. Many other important factors were not considered. For example, at what point of COVID-19 growth is each country at? If one compares March 14 to March 27, China's numbers are not much different while USA and many other countries have quite different numbers on those 2 days. The model cannot be stable due to this as well (time + point during growth). Also what about containment policy causing slower growth? Effects from such important confounding factors were not considered in the model.</p><p>3. There are many other smaller issues such as USA cases were mostly in Northeast, with latitude clearly higher than the one used to represent USA. In China, the cases happened in many provinces with vastly different latitude/temperature but all cases counted at one latitude/temperature. Moreover, the vast majority of the cases happened in China during Jan/Feb while you used late March temperature to represent them. Inaccuracies like these seriously impact modeling latitude/temperature as a continuous variable. Excluding countries with small population but high case rate as outliers is also questionable, given that you modeled population size already.</p><p>Fig. 7 could benefit from being plotted also for 2/29, 3/14, 3/21. Interpretation of Fig. 7 could instead be that it showed 2 groups of countries/latitudes that reflects the temporal sequence of events rather than temperature: COVID-19 started in China, spread to South Korea and Italy, then Europe and America as they trade/travel often and happen to all be cold countries; then in March COVID-19 picked up in southern hemisphere and tropical area and still going. It's likely time and policies that helped Australia case rate be relatively low instead of temperature, because the spread of COVID-19 is still early there and they learned from other countries to control the spread from early on.</p><p>Therefore I do not believe the paper provided convincing evidence for temperature-dependency of COVID-19.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.02.20051524";"2020-04-15";"14:34:21";"2020-04-15T14:34:21";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051524v2";"2020.04.02.20051524"

Regarding the tourists from China, according to a survey, the top 10 destination countries of China’s out bound countries are Japan, Thailand, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, UK, New Zealand, and Maldives, and 9 out of 10 of them are the ones with extremely low COVID-19 cases and deaths (4 or lower deaths per million) , as of April 13th, which makes it unlikely that the Traveling activity from China matters. This will be added to the discussion. Also, we evaluated the number of international arrivals in each country and it did not essentially affect the results (almost at all).</p><p>It can be easily explained by the fact that Asian countries were just alert to this virus. <br>This cannot be quantified, but to me it seems that the extent of the initial hazard strongly depends on the political policies toward this virus. Because once the vigorous policies such as the lockdown or prohibition of going out are taken, the spread of the virus stops. So, the question is when the nation could adapt such kinds of vigorous policies. This can easily explain why provinces of China, other than Wuhan showed low mortality rate. It is just because they took vigorous policies after seeing the hazard in Wuhan. No biological science is necessary here.  <br>And other nations in Asia including Russia, followed. <br> To me it seems, the western countries just made light of the virus for too long. Although, other factors such as the habit of mask, soybeans, green teas, the habit of wearing off shoes in the house were cited as the potential reasons why western countries were vulnerable to the virus in various types of studies, <br>Also, if you could not find the effect of number of tourists, then I believe you had made some mistakes. Because it is very very robust and correcting it substantially weakens the association between BCG policies and coronavirus statistics. I attached the data below. Please check by yourself.</p><p>&gt;&gt;5. As for masks and green tea, they cannot explain 1) the differences between Eastern Europe and Western Europe and 2) low COVID-19 indices in Africa, South America and South East Asia. We may consider their potential effect, once we can get any good statistics representing those things, but so far, we set priority low for these potential confounders.</p><p>Again, it doesn't have to explain everything at all. This logic is not scientific nor logical. Taiwan and provinces of China other than Wuhan might be robust to the virus because of the highest alert and vigorous policies. Japanese might be robust toward the virus because they were wearing masks. Singapore might be robust due to the IT application. So, at least it is assumed. <br>The BCG hypothesis cannot explain the differences between Israel/Lebanon and Iran. It cannot explain the difference between Wuhan and other provinces of China. It cannot explain the difference between France and Finland which has similar BCG status, but substantially different mortality rate. etcetc.  It cannot explain the difference between Taegu and other provinces of South Korea. Tokyo-strain-is-good theory cannot explain the lower number of death in Singapore. India-strain-is-good theory cannot explain the high mortality rate in Turkey. But these anecdotal evidences do not turn down nor support the BCG theory in epidemiological studies.</p><p>I attach the latest data of BCG policy, and the number of deaths 13 days after the detection of 100th case as well as average incidence rate since 1990, population, number of tourists, and national GDP. <br>In ANCOVAs in which the dependent variables is the number of deaths 13 days after the detection of the 100th case, BCG policy is a fixed factor and incidence rate of TB and population , the number of deaths did not show significant associations with BCG policy (ANCOVA in which, P = 0.280) nor the incidence rate of TB (p = 0.365). Similarly, using same covariates and the fixed factor in an additional ANCOVA, the number of cases 13 days after the detection of 100th case did not show even tendencies of associations with BCG policy nor the incidence rate of TB at all. Although, another ANCOVA with the same fixed factor and covariates showed how early the date of the detection of 100th case was, was significantly associated with BCG policy (p=0.0004), and the incidence rate of TB (p = 0.008).<br>However, after additionally correcting GDP, number of tourists, and ratio of the elderly, these associations of BCG policy and incidence rate of TB became insignificant ( p = 0.130, p = 0.221, respectively).And additional addition of number of foreign tourists alone cuts half the F value of the effects of BCG policy, so the effect of number of foreign tourists is apparent. Please check your data carefully.</p><p>Also, the similar but stronger patterns of associations are seen, in the case of consumption of soybean, and whether the country introduced 5G (which are associated with Western or developing countries). <br>For example, after controlling the nation as a covariate, whether the country introduced 5G by January is significantly associated with how early the date of the 100th case was(ANCOVA,p=0.000001) was as well as the number of cases 13 days after the 100th case (ANCOVA, p=0.013). When GDP, number of tourists, and ratio of 65 years old or older are additionally corrected as covariates, the latter association became insignificant (p = 0.368), but the former association between whether the country introduced 5G by January and how early the date of the 100th case was still remained significant (p = 0.001). Soybeans also showed the same significant patterns of how early the date of the 100th case was with same covariates.</p><p>I am not saying BCG doesn't work nor 5G is spreading the virus. It just shows, that this kind of analysis is the source of spurious correlations, and it cannot be and should not be treated as the scientific evidence of something.  Just like the abovementioned analyses are not the evidence of the effects of 5G on the coronavirus in anyways .Do you believe 5G has an effect to spread the virus??? If not, can you explain the technical methodological differences between what you are doing and what I showed above??</p><p>The following is my set of data if I haven't made any mistakes (I corrected

This means that it's likely that every other county in California has fewer unregistered infections than Santa Clara.</p><p>Second, study participants were people who responded to a facebook ad. This is a self-selected sample, and this property completely kills the usefulness of the study all by itself. This is a beginner's error! People who think they had Covid-19 and didn't get tested or know someone who did are much more likely to respond to such an ad than people who did not. (By comparison, the Gangelt study contacted 600 carefully chosen households per mail, and 400 responded. Still somewhat self-selected, but not as badly.)</p><p>Third, age is the one most common predictor of mortality. He did not weigh the results by age, and old people are underrepresented in the study. Anything he says about mortality is completely useless if we don't know how prevalent the infection was in the older population. (In Germany, cases show that the prevalence among tested older people was low initially and took a few weeks to rise.)</p><p>Fourth, instead he weighs prevalence by zip code--why? This exacerbates statistical variations, since there were only 50 positive results, and Santa Clara has ~60 zip codes. If you have a positive result fall on a populous zip code by chance where only a few participants participated, then the numbers are skewed up. They must have seen this happen because their estimated prevalence is almost twice as high as the raw prevalence.</p><p>Fifth, the specificity of the test is ""99.5% (95 CI 98.3-99.9%)"". This means that theoretically, if the specificity was 98.5%, all of the 50 positive results could be false positives, and nobody in the sample would have had any Covid-19.

The overall effect of such biases is hard to ascertain. ""</p><p>I think this is a very serious bias and let me explain why. It's very likely that your Facebook ads attracted a fair number of participants that were concerned they may have been infected with Covid-19. People who had experienced Covid-like symptoms in the recent past were more likely to pay attention to your Facebook ad and were also more likely to enroll in your study. Therefore your sample is not random.<br>Let's make some reasonable assumptions. Let's assume that 10% of your sample, or 333 participants had Covid-19 like symptoms in the past and were seeking antibody confirmation. I believe this percentage is very reasonable. <br>According to California statistics, approximately 25% of people tested for Covid-19 test positive. It could be very reasonable to assume that 15% of these 333 participants seeking antibody confirmation had been indeed infected. So that will equal to 50 positive participants, or the entire number of antibody test positive participants in your sample.<br>The example above proves that this bias is a valid concern. Your entire list of 50 antibody positive participants could have been participants seeking antibody confirmation.</p><p>There are several ways to remove the bias:<br>a. You mention in the article that you asked survey participants if they had prior clinical symptoms. You should try to exclude all participants that had symptoms (fever, chest pressure) similar to Covid-19 this year. This will indeed exclude all people that were ill, not only those who replied to the add to seek antibody confirmation. However, it will give you insight into the percentage of silent Covid-19 carriers, which is a question as important as the question you are trying to answer, and in a way equivalent. And the results will be unbiased. <br>b. Attempt to adjust for this bias. Calculate the percentage of participants in your sample who experienced Covid-19 symptoms and compare this with reasonable epidemiological data. Calculate a weight and apply it to your sample in addition to your zip-sex-race weights.</p><p>Regards, Daniel H.

In patients with severe SARS Cov disease, the virus was found to have damaged the heart in 35% of cases, causing ""cardiac disease including arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction"" (1). So, a fair portion of the patients in the Brazilian study probably already had poorly functioning hearts at the start of the study.</p><p>* The dosage in the high-dosage arm was extremely high: 2 x 600 mg of chloroquine per day for 10 days. Chloroquine is stronger and has more side effects than hydroxychloroquine. In comparison, Gautret et al found a substantial beneficial effect with a much lower dosage: 3 x 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day for 10 days (2).</p><p>* (Hydroxy)chloroquine has always been contraindicated for, or should be prescribed with extra caution to, patients with a cardiac arrythmia. (Which of the two differs per country.)</p><p>* It furthermore has a pretty good safety profile. Even in long-term use by patients with diabetes II, who have a high chance of retinopathy (3).</p><p>This suggests that (hydroxy)chloroquine could still be used in patients with mild symptoms that do not have a history of cardiac disease (the <i>congenital</i> Long QT Syndrome [LQTS] is a very rare disease).

ICU used to be 540 places in Sweden, now around 1000 or more.<br>The statistical data we use (from FHM) is at any moment in time an underestimation, which makes comparison with current numbers difficult.

Better (although still problematic) is to use just age, best to use a suitably fitted exponential of age.

The Hosmer-Lemeshow test is helpful but in view of possible extreme nonlinearity in confounding variables I think good results could be obtained from this when in fact they are not robust.</p><p>This is an interesting analysis and it would be good to see how the results hold with more careful handling of age correlation to CFR. There may be similar issues with other parameters, but more information would be needed here to determine that, and the very strong nonlinearity of CFR with age stands out.

Please clarify the total UV-C dose delivered in Figure 1, as the peer-reviewed literature points to UV-C dose of &gt; 1.0 J/cm2 as the critical factor in N95 FFR viral inactivation treatment. Although UV-C dose governs viral inactivation, the preprint does not clearly state the germicidal UV-C dose delivered to the N95 coupons for the Figure 1 treatment times. While germicidal UV dose is the product of the UV-C irradiance and exposure time, comparison to the minimally acceptable UV-C dose of 1.0 J/cm^2 is needed.  UV-C irradiance varies significantly both between and within systems, so treatment time is not an accurate characterization metric for understanding UV-C germicidal efficacy (especially when translating to a different dosing system); dose needs to be quantified directly with a NIST-traceable, calibrated radiometer matched to the germicidal wavelength range of the source.  At the reported 5 µW/cm^2 irradiance, the total dose delivered during a 60 min treatment period is only 18 mJ/cm^2, greater than an order of magnitude lower than the effective 1.0 J/cm^2 UV-C dose reported in the literature for similar viruses [<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fannweh%2Farticle%2F56%2F1%2F92%2F166111%3A7a2mtnapZSQ4K-OSjUQ6YYBGWcw&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://academic.oup.com/annweh/article/56/1/92/166111"">Lore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ara.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FMitigateShortageofRespiratoryProtectionDevices_2.pdf%3AYAsM9P6b2uviDe1GHuWvse_vSuM&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.ara.com/sites/default/files/MitigateShortageofRespiratoryProtectionDevices_2.pdf"">Heimbuch &amp; Harnish, 2019</a>, <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F29678452%3A8XOXbkzipBBqtfAURFsrjsckVoY&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678452"">Mills et al., 2018</a>] and current CDC guidelines for UVGI decontamination of N95s [<a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fppe-strategy%2Fdecontamination-reuse-respirators.html%3AnLPNN-D2G1zWN51Qu-7F17UBQpw&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html"">CDC</a>].

It is in this spirit of collegiality that we draw attention to an aspect that could (unintentionally) cause confusion: the PS19Q thermopile sensor mentioned in the Methods section does not appear to be suited to detect the virus-killing UV-C light emitted from the source.  The authors are aware of the possible confusion and are working diligently to check into and, if needed, address the concern.</p><p>As background: from the manufacturer’s specifications, the PS19Q thermopile sensor mentioned in the preprint appears to only detect wavelengths as low as 300 nm, which is above the UV-C germicidal wavelength range (&lt;280 nm). Low-pressure mercury UVGI bulbs emit a 253.7 nm peak [EPA]. 260 nm is the peak UV-C germicidal wavelength for inactivating virus via DNA and RNA damage [Kowalski et al., 2009, Ito and Ito, 1986]. The germicidal efficacy arises primarily from the UV-C dose, with the UV-B dose (280-320 nm) providing significantly lower germicidal efficacy. At 300 nm, UV light is ~10x less effective at killing pathogens than at 254 nm [Lytle and Sagripanti 2005]. UV-A dose (320-400 nm) is considered minimally germicidal [Kowalski et al., 2009; Lytle and Sagripanti 2005; EPA]. We are concerned about the potential adverse health outcomes that might stem from use of the PS19Q thermopile sensor not matched to the UVGI wavelengths for N95 FFR decontamination.</p><p>As best practices, all researchers working on UV-C methods are encouraged to use a calibrated, NIST-traceable, UV-C-specific radiometer to report not just UV-C irradiance, but also UV-C specific dose, as a minimally acceptable UV-C dose of 1.0 J/cm^2 is sought on all N95 FFR surfaces.

Samples from patients with fever and negative for the SARS-COV-2 test were used as control. At inpatient admission, total lymphocytes number was decreased in severe patients but not in mild patients, whereas neutrophils were increased in severe patients. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were diminished in all COVID-19 patients. CD19+ B cells and NK cells were decreased in both mild and severe patients, however, severe patients showed a notable reduction. These data might suggest a profound deregulation of lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients. Further analysis showed significant increases of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα in blood of severe patients at the admission. Sequential samples revealed that IL-2 and IL-6 peaked on day 15-20 and declined thereafter. A moderate increase of IL-4 was seen in mild/moderate patients. Thus, elevation of IL-2, IL-6 can be indicators of severe COVID-19.<br><u>Critical analysis of the study: </u><br>There is no information on when the patients were assessed as severe or mild/moderate, at inpatient admission or later. The authors could have analyzed the correlation between immune cell population and cytokine levels to see, for example, if severe lymphopenia correlated to higher elevation of IL-2.<br><u>The importance and implications for the current epidemics:</u><br>While similar findings have already been shown, the data corroborates alterations in circulating adaptive and innate immune cell populations and cytokines, and its correlation to disease severity. The increase of IL-2 and IL-6 at the admission might an indicator to start intensive therapies (like convalescent serum) at an early time.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.12.20034736";"2020-04-16";"21:55:50";"2020-04-16T21:55:50";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.12.20034736v1";"2020.03.12.20034736"

The retrospective study included 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and with SAR-CoV-2 specific serum IgM and IgG detected. From the study cohort, 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG levels increased over 8 weeks after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM levels peaked at 4 weeks. SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM levels were higher in the deceased group, and correlated positively with the IgG levels and increased leucocyte count in this group, a indication of severe inflammation. IgM levels correlated negatively with clinical outcome and with albumin levels. The authors suggest that IgM levels could be assessed to predict clinical outcome.</p><p>Potential limitations:</p><p>There are limitations that should be taken into account. First, the sample: small size, patients from a single-center and already critically ill when they were admitted. Second, the authors compared serum IgM levels in deceased patients and mild-moderate patients and found that the levels were higher in deceased group, however even if the difference is statistically significant the number of patients in the two groups was very different. Moreover, receiving operating characteritics (ROC) curves were used to evaluate IgM and IgG as potential predictors for clinical outcome. Given the low number of cases, specially in the deceased group, it remains to be confirmed if IgM levels could be predictive of  worst outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The study did not explore the role of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG in COVID-19 pneumonia.</p><p>Overall relevance for the field:</p><p>Some results of this study have been supported by subsequent studies that show that older age and patients who have comorbidities are more likely to develop a more severe clinical course with COVID-19, and severe SARS-CoV-2 may trigger an exaggerated immune response. The study seems to demonstrate that the increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM could indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, however given the very small sample size, the results are not yet conclusive.</p><p>Review by Meriem Belabed as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285";"2020-04-16";"21:17:49";"2020-04-16T21:17:49";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285v1";"2020.03.22.20041285"

The severity of the disease was determined according to version 5 of the Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. The percentage of patients with comorbidities was 32%, and it was reported similar between methylprednisolone treated and untreated groups. The results showed that the group of patients that received methylprednisolone (n=26) had a shorter number of days with fever than patients that did not received methylprednisolone (n=20); they also had a faster improvement of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and better outcomes in follow-up CT scans of the lungs. The dosage of methylprednisolone was reported to be 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, although there is no information about the concrete dosages for each patient. From the 46 patients, 43 recovered and were discharged, while 3 cases were fatal. Patients without administration of methylprednisolone needed longer periods of supplemental oxygen therapy, though there is no reference to the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in leucocyte and lymphocyte counts nor in the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 or IL-10 after treatment with methylprednisolone.</p><p>Some of our main criticisms to this study are also pointed-out by the authors themselves: it is a retrospective single-center study with no validation cohort and without mid- and long-term follow-ups. The reported mortality was 7% (3/46) and did not appear to be affected by corticosteroid treatment: one patient died in the group that did not receive methylprednisolone, while two patients died in the methylprednisolone treatment group. Additionally, although the authors mention that patients received cotreatments, such as antiviral therapy and antibiotics, there is no mention of differences between the prevalence of other medications between the two groups. Unfortunately, there is also no indication on whether the patients receiving methylprednisolone were discharged earlier; the authors merely refer that the symptoms and signs improved faster.</p><p>Corticosteroid have been widely used as therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including in infections by SARS-CoV, so these findings in COVID-19 patients are not unexpected. The implications of this study for the current pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 require evaluation in future clinical trials, especially in a randomized way and in combination with and comparison to other immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, including hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, based on this report, the intravenous application of methylprednisolone with the intention of strengthening the immunosuppressive treatment and controlling the cytokine storm appears to be safe in COVID-19 patients, and it might successfully shorten the recovery period.</p><p>This review was undertaken by Alvaro Moreira, MD as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai</p>";"10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342";"2020-04-16";"18:03:55";"2020-04-16T18:03:55";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032342v1";"2020.03.06.20032342"

The Wuhan study at the very least would need to account for the following:</p><p>HCQ &lt;— comorbidities —&gt; recovery<br>HCQ &lt;— symptom onset —&gt; recovery<br>HCQ &lt;— drug prescriptions —&gt; recovery</p><p>Adjusting for the confounding variable would essentially smooth out the flow of information between the treatment (HCQ) and the outcome (recovery), allowing for the inference of causal effects.</p><p>Assuming observable data is not available to adjust for confounding variables, a casual mechanism (mediator) could smooth out the flow of information from the treatment to the outcome (so long as the mediator is not influenced by confounder).</p><p>Luckily, multiple in vitro studies have been performed. One study posits that HCQ lowers endosomal pH which ultimately inhibits COVID from binding to ACE 2 and decreasing viral intensity (3).</p><p>HCQ —&gt; endosomal pH —&gt;glycosylation of COVID cellular receptor —&gt; ACE 2 binding —&gt; viral intensity —&gt; acute lung injury</p><p>Another in-silico study posits that HCQ blocks specific protein sites on the host ACE2 cell, thereby thwarting its attempt to infect it and preventing the cytokine storm (over-reaction of the lymphatic system) that some posit is responsible for Acute Lung Injury (3). So here we have an entirely different causal mechanism:</p><p>HCQ —&gt; BRD-2 receptor sites —&gt; cytokine storm —&gt; acute lung injury</p><p>Despite these problems, some believe that the p-values obviate the need to control for potentially lurking variables. However, they are subject to myriad influences, known as p-hacking. Whether it is the number of tests performed or the number of comparisons made, it increases the chance of finding a statistically significant p-value (4). Three professional statisticians co-authored a paper reviewing the validity of the Wuhan study (5). There were several issues with the data upon which the two significant p-values were based.</p><p>I suppose there is also a pragmatic argument: The p-values, along with existing studies and reports, are sufficient enough evidence to offset any concern for lurking variables in these urgent times. In other words, how much evidence is sufficient to warrant large scale roll-out of a low-cost treatment that may have a beneficial effect, from saving individuals who would have otherwise died to curbing its spread?</p><p>The consequences of large roll-out: manufacturing, scaling, distribution chains, and so forth could result in a tremendous diversion of resources. How many pharmaceutical manufacturers even have the capacity to roll out production of this magnitude? What if they all start scaling their labor to produce this particular drug. You can’t just put this genie back into the bottle. Not to mention the scientific energy/intellectual capital that would go to proving or disproving this proposed treatment. And why? Because scientific evidence demanded it? No because a tortured p-value and unpublished/unsubstantiated anecdotal evidence caught the attention of some in the media, and it has been over-popularized as a panacea. What about the risk that HCQ is not an effective treatment despite large investments in cash and resources that have been invested? Do you think the wheels of capitalism turn so easily?  Investors will want a return and if that means continually touting an ineffective drug through spurious science, they will continue to do so. What about individuals taking HCQ as a prophylactic, believing themselves to be protected against COVID?  Or COVID+ individuals taking HCQ and believing themselves to be cured? Or individuals who think: Well, if I get it—I’ll just take HCQ and be fine. This would increase the spread of COVID. From my perspective, the ignorance to viral transmission and the required precautions is widespread. This is just one more reason not to acquiesce to the new social norms of wearing face masks, social distancing, and abiding by shelter-in-place rules. Here, I think an understanding of cognitive psychology is important to anticipate the future behavior of a society in which a cheap and easy-to-manufacture cure is published in the media.</p><p>To sum up, HCQ's efficacy is not sufficiently proven to warrant a widespread roll-out, because it could result in several downstream consequences, from the diversion of resources (both manufacturing capabilities and intellectual capital) to increasing the risk threshold of individuals--who spurious believe in an easy and cheap treatment--thereby increasing the infection rate. One of two things needs to happen. Clinical trials that properly adjust for all potential comorbidities. Or the discovery of a causal mechanism (in vivo), which would obviate the need to control/adjust for confounders. For me, this would tip the utilitarian scales in regard to the potential benefits versus the risks.</p><p>References</p><p>1.	Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. 2018.

R's `mctest` package does a good job too (`omcdiag` includes the Farrar-Glauber test)</p><p>I would suspect some rank deficiency caused by correlation between hypertension and variables that represent CVD-ish things; not necessarily pairwise - and this is the problem with booleans.</p><p>Weak collinearity can happen because of weighted sums of columns - 3 boolean columns can give a run of '2' values, that correspond 'enough' with the '1's in the hypertension column. Add in other correlates with hypertension (age, obesity and maleness) and it would be suspicious if there <i>wasn't</i> collinearity.</p><p>I don't think it would be viewed negatively if you dropped the 19 newborns (who are confounders in the 'hospitalisation' regression, since they are always hospitalised), so long as it was clearly disclosed: the presence of those 19 observations will also mess up the 'critical illness' regression as well (it would only require a handful of newborns to need critical care for things unrelated to COVID19, to bias up the OR for their age group, and their presence already biases up recovery rates).</p><p>Lastly: it would be relatively straightforward to furnish the R script and the parameters (and residuals) without furnishing the data - that way interested people could generate their own pseudo-data and run some Monte Carlo experiments to get an idea of the asymptotic properties of the estimates. (To do it properly it would be good to have a covariance matrix so that the pseudodata could be generated by an appropriate cupola).</p><p>.</p><p>It's a pity that (as far as I am aware) Disqus does not permit any type of maths markup.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794";"2020-04-16";"06:58:38";"2020-04-16T06:58:38";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057794v1";"2020.04.08.20057794"

I agree with your other comment and might owe the delta method an apology (I still haven’t personally checked what I get with and without the delta method, but I’ve found enough other errors that I’ve lost interest -- I'll take your word that it doesn't mess things up too bad).</p><p>Regarding your other comment, you're right -- and it gets worse. According to the example they provide when going from var(\pi) to sd(\pi) it looks like they divide the whole variance by the _Santa Clara County sample size_ before square rooting. That means they effectively used the sample size of the Santa Clara County sample for the variance estimate of the sensitivity and specificity which is about a factor of ~10 larger than both the sample size used for estimating sensitivity and the sample size used to estimate specificity.</p><p>They also use \hat{s}(1-\hat{s}) to estimate the variance (the sample size should really go in the denominator here), but that estimate is not accurate when \hat{s} is close to zero or one. A better estimate is the Agresti-Coull estimator which about doubles the estimated variance for the specificity.</p><p>Lastly, and importantly to my sanity check — they apply their demographic weighting to the proportion of positive tests. It would make way more sense to me to apply it to the estimated prevalence. I can see how different zip codes might have different prevalences and as a result a different proportion of positive tests, but i can’t see another mechanism for how different zip codes might have different rates of positive tests (while still having the same test sensitivity and specificity). If one were to do the reweighting of the prevalence instead of the positives, then my sanity check goes through — if the original sample could be all false positives the prevalence could be zero and then the reweighted prevalence would also be zero.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463";"2020-04-20";"16:21:00";"2020-04-20T16:21:00";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1";"2020.04.14.20062463"

"2209";"4882574835";"disqus_PzN6avqkmL";"Philip Davies";"<p>Interesting study, thank you.</p><p>This is another study that attempts to ascertain if oral HCQ tablets can be of clinical use in patients more than one week into symptomatic disease, hospitalized with bilateral pneumonia and with evidence of established inflammatory reaction (cytokine storm). That's a big ask for any oral medication.</p><p>The study is again small (both arms have less than 100 patients). The most significant outcome measured (death) is realized in very small numbers (3 and 4). The confidence levels are extremely wide.</p><p>The are several problems with this study. There are marked differences in the two populations. The study honestly attempts to accommodate these confounding factors using a propensity score method (IPTW). Normally this method is valuable but here I can’t see that it has been well applied.</p><p>It pays to look at the raw data. There is a significant difference (between the two arms) in the initial intensity of disease.</p><p>At baseline (admission), HCQ arm comprises 78.3% men (&gt;20% more of these higher risk patients than control arm with 64.9%); HCQ arm has 21.9% patients with more severe disease in the form of CT showing &gt;50% lung affected). This is &gt;80% more than in control arm (12.1%). HCQ arm has 90.5% patients with CRP &gt; 40mg/l (CRP is a good indicator of impending/current severity). This is 10% higher than control arm (81.9%). HCQ arm had median O2 flow on admission = 3 litres/minute (50% higher than control arm at 2 litres / minute).</p><p>So, at baseline, the HCQ arm had significantly more patients with severe disease than control arm. The O2 flow is actually more significant than first sight would suggest. 2 l/m is always the first step in O2 therapy. The data shows us that most patients in the control arm could hold their sats on this first step therapy. This also means they may have been OK on just 1 l/m. We don't know. But we do know that most patients in the HQN could not hold their sats at that first step and needed an increase (3 l/m ... so that's 50-300% more O2 than control arm).</p><p>Admittedly there were other confounding factors which compromised the control arm more than HCQ arm (some chronic disease elements). But it's clear to me that disease severity was markedly more established in the HCQ arm.</p><p>Another factor to note: the HCQ treatment was not initiated at the moment those baseline values were obtained (on admission). The HCQ was initiated within 48 hours. So let’s look again at the timelines. The median duration of symptoms at admission shows that the HCQ arm comprised patients who were further into worsening illness: they were admitted on D8 compared to control, D7. They may not have had HCQ initiated until D10.</p><p>Then we look at outcomes: the raw data shows that the disadvantaged HCQ arm actually does better in the two most important outcomes, death and ICU admission. The HCQ delivers 12% less death and ICU admissions than the control arm. Admittedly the numbers are small so the confidence levels are very wide.</p><p>So what does that tell us? The answer is not much. But even accepting the poorly aligned baseline for disease severity, the outcomes with their wide 95% confidence levels do deliver a mildly promising indication on the 'swingometer'. They point more towards benefit than harm when using HCQ in this advanced disease state.</p><p>As a final comment on significant side effects (increased QT interval) from the use of HCQ. Once again, this trial used a particularly high dose of HCQ (600mg/day...right at ceiling dose for rheumatological use and much higher than the total antimalarial treatment dose). They also added azithromycin (another QT lengthening drug) to 20% of the HCQ patients. It’s not surprising at all to find such QT lengthening in a sick, more elderly population taking these medications in particularly high doses).</p><p>Further trials should utilize conservative doses of CQ/HCQ which have been proven safe in many millions of patients.</p><p>We don't yet know how this will pan out. We urgently need proper evidence. Statistically robust studies into prophylaxis and early intervention are likely to deliver the most interesting results.</p><p>Dr Philip Davies<br>Aldershot Centre For Health<br><a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevirus.uk%3AhtEXUvGB9oUtElJ5qloZMzFsgdk&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""http://thevirus.uk"">http://thevirus.uk</a></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.10.20060699";"2020-04-20";"15:36:38";"2020-04-20T15:36:38";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060699v1";"2020.04.10.20060699"

The mechanism that is commonly cited in the literature for the loss in filtration efficiency - disrupting the surface charges on the microfibers - is wrong.  In our manuscript uploaded to medRxiv last week (Nazeeri et al.), we report a similar drop in efficiency after rising in EtOH/water solution, followed by simple air drying. On that point we agree. However, we noticed that the mass of the respirators was still significantly more than their original weight, arguing that simple air drying was not enough.  When we dried them further in a vacuum, we were stunned to see that the filtration efficiency bounced back up to the N95 levels as the pressure dropped from ~ 13 down to below 6 mbar (0.6 kPa).  This is typically the range where thin films of surface adsorbed water are removed from a room-temperature vacuum surface. The adsorbed water seems to be the cause of the loss of filtration efficiency.  Hence, simple EtOH solutions can indeed be effective at both disinfecting AND RESTORING function to degraded N95 respirators that are based on melt-blown, corona-charged microfibers of polypropylene.</p><p>The Nazeeri et al. manuscript is here:</p><p>An Efficient Ethanol-Vacuum Method for the Decontamination and Restoration of N95 Polypropylene Microfiber Medical Masks &amp; Respirators</p><p>Albert I.

These separate variances are the variances of the binomial distribution (p(1-p)), not rescaled by the inverse of the sample size.

In contrast to spike protein binding Abs, nAbs were not cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, nAb titers moderately correlated with the amount of spike protein binding antibodies. Both neutralizing and binding Ab titers varied across patient subsets of all ages, but were significantly higher in middle-aged (40-59 yrs) and elderly (60-85) <i>vs</i>. younger patients (15-39 yrs). However, plasma nAb titers were found to be below detection level in 5.7% (10/175) of patients, i.e. a small number of patients recovered without developing a robust nAb response. Conversely, 1.14% (2/175) of patients had substantially higher titers than the rest. Notably, in addition to patient age, nAb titers correlated moderately with serum CRP levels but were inversely related to lymphocyte count on admission. In summary, the authors show that patients with clinically mild COVID-19 disease mount a strong humoral response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to younger patients, middle-aged and elderly patients had both higher neutralizing and binding Ab titers, accompanied by increased CRP levels and lower lymphocyte counts. These patients are usually considered at higher risk of severe disease. Therefore, robust neutralizing and binding Ab responses may be particularly important for recovery in this patient subset. Conversely, patients who failed to produce high nAb/binding Ab titers against spike protein did not progress to severe disease, indicating that binding Abs against other viral epitopes as well as cellular immune responses are equally important.</p><p><b>Limitations</b></p><p>This study provides valuable information on the kinetics of spike protein-specific nAb as well as binding Ab titers in a cohort of convalescent mild COVID-19 patients of all ages. However, similar studies enrolling larger patient numbers, including those diagnosed with moderate and severe disease as well as survivors and non-survivors, especially in the elderly group (to rule out potential bias for more favorable outcome), are warranted for reliable assumptions on the potentially protective role of Abs and nAbs in COVID-19. Moreover, longitudinal observation beyond the acute and convalescent phase in addition to stringent clinical and immunological characterization is urgently needed. <br>In their study, Wu et al. did not measure binding Abs against non-S viral proteins, which are also induced in COVID-19 and therefore could have added valuable diagnostic information with regard to patients who seemingly failed to mount both binding and neutralizing Ab responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Likewise, while this study excluded cross-reactivity of nAbs against SARS-CoV-1, no other coronaviruses were tested. Of additional note, neutralizing activity of plasma Abs was only assessed by pseudotype neutralization assay, not against live SARS-CoV-2. Generally, while these are widely used and reproducible assays, <i>in vitro</i> neutralization of pseudotyped viruses does not necessarily translate to effective protection against the respective live virus in <i>vivo</i> (cf. review by Burton, D. Antibodies, viruses and vaccines. Nat Rev Immunol 2, 706–713 (2002)). Further studies are therefore needed to assess the specificity and neutralizing characteristics of these Abs to test whether they could be candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. In this context, setting arbitrary cut-off values (ID50&lt;500 <i>vs</i>. a detection limit of ID50 &lt; 40) and thus classifying up to 30% of patients in this study as “weak” responders does not take into account our currently limited knowledge regarding protective capacity of these nAbs and should therefore have been avoided by the authors.</p><p><b>Significance</b></p><p>This preprint is arguably the first report on neutralizing and binding Ab titers in a larger cohort of mild COVID-19 patients. Assessing Ab titers in these patients is not only important in order to confirm whether mild COVID-19 elicits robust nAb responses, but also adds further information regarding the use of plasma from mild disease patients for convalescent plasma therapy as well as vaccine design in general. Future studies will need to address now whether the nAb responses generated in mild disease will be protective or (functionally) different from nAbs generated in moderate and severe disease. The findings in this study are therefore of great relevance and should be further explored in ongoing research on potential coronavirus therapies and prevention strategies.</p><p><i>This review was undertaken as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365";"2020-04-19";"16:51:41";"2020-04-19T16:51:41";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047365v1";"2020.03.30.20047365"

However, I am concerned that the statistical analysis might have been done in haste and that the rejection of 0% prevalence is an artifact of this. I would be more than happy to stand corrected! (Disclaimer: Jeffrey Spence posted very similar observations earlier. I post this anyway as I think I can marginally add value on exposition.)</p><p>The positive rate in the raw data is 50/3330=1.5%. The test’s false positive rate is estimated at 2/301=.5%, but with a 95% confidence interval extending upward to 1.9%. This means we cannot reject the hypothesis of zero prevalence. Note (this will become important): Because the binomial distribution is not well approximated by a normal here, the CI must be constructed as exact binomial, not by normal approximation. The authors do this and correctly report 1.9%. If they had mistakenly used a normal approximation combined with the sample variance, their CI would have extended only to 1.2% and zero prevalence would have been spuriously rejected.</p><p>Based on this, it is puzzling that the “headline” CI’s for prevalence do not include 0. Indeed, the authors state in their statistical appendix (bottom of page 2) that they need the positive rate to exceed 1-sensitivity. But then they move on to reject 0 anyway, in apparent violation of their own CI for sensitivity! What gives?</p><p>I conjecture that the problem is their subsequent use of the delta-method to analyze error propagation. This implicitly applies a normal approximation to all random variables under study. Indeed, the analysis culminates in providing standard errors, and these are only interpretable in the context of normal approximation. But recall that the normal approximation is inappropriate for the validation sample and furthermore that incorrectly using it would have yielded spurious rejection of zero prevalence. I conjecture that this is implicitly committed in the later part of the analysis. The earlier conclusion that 0 cannot be rejected seems appropriate to me.</p><p>Again, I’d be happy to stand corrected and also appreciate that the paper was put together under insane pressure.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463";"2020-04-19";"00:10:56";"2020-04-19T00:10:56";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1";"2020.04.14.20062463"

More rigorous, referenced comments why you choose to use a model that is not widely used in infectious disease outbreak modelling would be useful, and preferable present the results in parallel with a standard SEIR model. You could also discuss IHME model.</p><p>For the parameters:<br>    • I am not sure how you calculated the deaths. If you used Wuhan data, all case fatality numbers need to be revised as China updated its numbers. This is also obvious from your figure 6. There are 61 deaths as per 18 April in HUS (and it does not include all 48 deaths outside hospitals), and ~ this number should be reached only around 1 May. There is something else wrong than just the Chinese number, I think. If I understand correctly from the text that you may have calculated the deaths from HUS data, it goes badly wrong, I am afraid. There is literature how to correct the ongoing outbreak death numbers to get accurate estimates, or use Chinese numbers. Calculating the mortality rates is one of the most challenging things. Even though new cases would stop today, number of deaths would increase for the next 3-4 weeks from the current case load. Simply dividing the number of deaths by total number of cases may only be used post-outbreak. <br>    • Individual characteristics should include underlying illness if possible, not only age.

This is likely (one of) the reason(s) why the outbreaks are so explosive in the elderly people’s homes. But as the illness is often mild(er) during the first week (when cases infect onward), and it was also noted in the mentioned publication that there was not a difference between severe and mild cases in the initial/peak excretion (but # observations small), this may not need to be taken into account, but would need to be mentioned. Excretion (or lack of it) may need to be taken into account with children.<br>    • Cases should be ideally categorized to travel, community acquired and mass gathering participants as well as household contacts. These all have different time spent in the community before testing and isolation. Help line has probably an algorithm for the cases which could be used.<br>    • Massong 2008 is pretty outdated reference for a contact matrix, there are more recent ones. Note that especially school aged children from abroad may not be valid as there are no boarding schools in Finland.<br>    • Relative infectiousness period is quite short, it is up to a week, please refer to<br><a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41591-020-0869-5%3AkwJNkKPzSTWO8jUNe45LEzgBDE0&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0869-5"">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41...</a><br>    • P(infection|virus contact), test more values, this is out of a hat(?) Needs a distribution (gamma) around it.<br>    •  P(symptomatic|infection) 50 %, Ferguson’s figure includes mild cases, ie. it is not really asymptomatic, but “non-GP-seeking”.<br>    • P(death|severe, not hospitalized) 20 % seems too low. Please have a look on the elderly home data.<br>    • The assumption that test positive would lead to 0 % transmission is likely quite false. Most of the mild cases remain at their homes (they should ideally be isolated to a hcf, but this is unlikely happening). There are publications describing household cases where this may be estimated. This could and should be assessed ideally from HUS case data.</p><p>A positive thing is that your study clearly shows (what was also known from international data) that suppression works well, mitigation is of less use.

I assume more people will die if we devote resources to an unproven and ineffective treatment, to say nothing of the false hope and unintended consequences it will create. Resources spent on HCQ could have been otherwise invested in researching other treatments, including RAAS inhibitors (i.e. ARBs), Naproxen, androgen receptor inhibitors, corticosteroids, just to name a few (1). <br>In addition, I assume that people will naively believe HCQ to be a cheap and effective treatment, thereby increasing their risk threshold, breaking shelter-in-place rules, and increasing the infection rate—ultimately resulting in more lives lost than saved. (At the very least, the empirical support for HCQ is not sufficient to outweigh these potential downstream consequences.) And this is not “people doing stupid things”—it is biology. It is people using cognitively flawed heuristic reasoning, in which we reduce complex reasoning tasks into much simpler, flawed ones. This, sad to say, must be taken up with Darwin.</p><p>I assume the following:<br>1. Finite resources exist in regard to manufacturing and distribution capability as well as intellectual capital.2.  The most efficacious treatment will not fortuitously align with that which can be most quickly supported with empirical evidence, brought to market, and effectively publicized. 3. Companies who invest large amounts of capital in researching, producing, and distributing a drug will not simply acquiesce when a more efficacious treatment comes along. In all likelihood, they will continue to hire top scientists (diverting intellectual capital) to perform hundreds of clinical trials and continue to pick the ones with the most compelling statistical significance.<br>More simply, profit-seeking will confound research’s collective pursuit of the best treatment.</p><p>“The FDA has logically made an emergency approval for the use of the drug.""</p><p>The approval was made under the very limited authority of section 564 of the FD&amp;C Act, which articulates Emergency Use Authorizations (2). In fact, the authorization is supported by a fact sheet in which the use of HCQ is premised with ""In order to mitigate the risks of using this approved product for an unapproved use under EUA and to optimize the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.” It certainly is a pragmatic move; but, at best, a rushed benefit/cost analysis (and perhaps in time will prove the right one).</p><p>""If there is a competing technology that shows greater promise you have a point. But there isn’t.""<br>There are plenty of competing ideas. One meta-analysis surveyed 1315 journal articles in a review of pharmacological treatments (1), after which it determined remdesivir as “the most promising.”Unfortunately, this treatment has even less empirical support than HCQ. In one study, a 35 y/o healthy male, after progressively worsening symptoms, received treatment on day 7 of hospital admission (day 11 of symptom onset). Within 24 hours, the patient’s oxygen saturation went from 90% to 96%, and he was taken off supplemental oxygen (3). In the other study 12 patients were examined, of which 3 received the treatment. The study was plagued by confounding variables. Not to mention, all 12 patients recovered (4). It should be noted that these studies are only footnoted in the article.<br>If it were between HCQ and remdesivir, I would agree with you. But it is not a dichotomy. There are plenty of avenues that need exploring—RAAS inhibitors (i.e. ARBs), Naproxen, androgen receptor inhibitors, corticosteroids, just to name a few—before committing to one treatment.</p><p>References:<br><a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Ffullarticle%2F2764727https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Femergency-preparedness-and-response%2Fmcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework%2Femergency-use-authorizationhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1056%2FNEJMoa2001191%3Axo-Kjm_Bx5WZA3jBKvPccRuru0c&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764727https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorizationhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191"">https://jamanetwork.com/jou...</a><br><a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.03.09.20032896v1%3AYq9zmkXCENRukFHU0iSYd5xX6B4&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20032896v1"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a></p>";"10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758";"2020-04-18";"19:17:43";"2020-04-18T19:17:43";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v3";"2020.03.22.20040758"

"2637";"4880275299";"disqus_O6JSB4ru8p";"Tom Johnson";"<p>Please allow me five responses to this study:<br>1.  Yes, it's true that there are large numbers of people who have probably been exposed to Covid-19 and experienced no symptoms and have antibodies.  The best country to look at with regard to testing mass numbers of people randomly is Iceland.  Icelad has now tested over 11% of its entire population and a lot of testing was truly done randomly.  The fatality rate there is around .6%, or one in about 167 people.  In New Zealand, which has also engaged in massive testing, the fatality rate is about .8% or 1 in 125 people.  HOWEVER (and this is a big however). the fatality rate in both countries has gone up steadily and is continuing to go up.  Also, in those countries the average age of people infected is much lower than in other countries, like Italy, who have been hit much harder by this disease.  This actually jives with the original fatality rate given by the World Health Organization, which was around .3 to .5% for younger people, and markedly higher for older people. <br>Also, the average fatality rate for the common flu is about 1 in 2,000.  So even if we can agree that the fatality rate of Covid-19 might be lower than originally thought, it's way more dangerous than any common flu.  It is also exponentially more contagious, which is a huge part of the problem.  <br>2.  As testing becomes more and more widely available across the planet, the fatality rate has gone markedly up across the board, not down.  For closed cases, the fatality rate has gone from 3-4% initially to now 21% and rising.<br>3.  The fatality rate in this study assumes that no one ever died at home from Covid-19.  As a matter of fact, NYC is now including people who died at home from Covid-19 but a lot of US states and other countries are not, which would artificially lower the fatality rate, when it could actually be much higher.<br>4. To say that somehow the fatality rate of this disease is no worse than just a really bad seasonal flu is looney tunes and doesn't pass the eyeball test since many, many perfectly healthy people with no pre-existing medical conditions are dying as a result of this disease left and right, including young and middle aged people.  That simply doesn't happen with seasonal flu.  The self-reported symptoms of Covid-19 are also far worse than most self-reported symptoms of the common flu.  Recovery time also appears to be longer, and many doctors are reporting lung and heart tissue damage.<br>5. There are about 18,000 people in Santa Clara County who have tested for Covid-19 and about 10% of those tested positive.  Is it possible that the same people who tested negative could have already had Covid-19 and it was already defeated by their immune system and they now have antibodies and are testing negative?  Could it be that these very same people who already tested negative for the virus are now volunteering to test for antibodies?  In this case, there is a massive level of redundancy and the study is useless and can't be extrapolated to the general public.  This study is far too small and not random enough to provide any usefull information whatsoever.  We would need truly random testing of a much bigger group of people to provide any insight at all into what the actual fatality rate is.  We would also need to include a much wider age range.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463";"2020-04-18";"17:11:55";"2020-04-18T17:11:55";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1";"2020.04.14.20062463"

Thankfully you have weighed in there. I will add one major critique here that has not been mentioned, and I call it the reality test.  This is how I test all research, including my own for soundness. I ask, were this to be sound/true, what would this mean?  This is a broad question. Now, if their work is truly reflective of what is out there, then it would mean that the fatality rate is on par with ordinary flue. And we would expect a dip in flu in 2020, because of all the social isolating and the washing of hands. Last year, the flu,(over the course of a year) accounted for 34,000 deaths. However, as of yesterday, over 37,000 deaths have been attributed to Covid 19, and it is suspected that there might be up to another 10,000 in unconfirmed deaths. And this just after only weeks of the first person dying from the virus. In fact, the virus is now the leading killer in the US.  <br>Now, how does this stack up with their findings? We can be sure of the 37,000 deaths, because their bodies have been disposed of, and usually people are dead when buried or cremated.  So, this study, is inaccurate by a large margin. How is it that the hospitalisation rates increased exponentially at the start? If their numbers held, then this would not happen. I like to give greater weight to actual factual knowledge. and so my first thoughts were to look at the methodology. The sampling was poor, and in any decent research, this would not pass mustard. It would fail an undergrad piece of work. The other part was the testing, and I have no expertise here. I suspect that this is suspect, given what we know about the actual sudden spike in fatalities.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463";"2020-04-18";"14:23:15";"2020-04-18T14:23:15";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1";"2020.04.14.20062463"

But again, since the criteria in the survey was IgG *or* IgM, the specifity is actually lower - at maximun 99.1%, and possibly even 98.65% (if the false-positives in the manufactures validation were for different people between IgG and IgM).</p><p>Taking both these mistakes into account (i.e. assuming 100% sensitivity and 98.65% specificity) - the estimated prevalence (before correcting by sex age etc., which I find to be irrelevant) is a mere 0.15%. A lot less exciting.</p><p>I find it surprising that the writers quoted different (let alone wrong) values for sensitivity and specificity (once IgM and once IgG), in a way that miraculously led to higher prevalence estimations.</p><p>I allow myself to ignore the writers self validation of the kit, since specificty was tested accross an outrageously small sample size of 30 non- Covid19 samples. As the writers acknowledged themselves, that is only enough to ensure the kit has a specificity above 90%.

We identified 5,906 COVID-19 patients treated in the Veterans Health Administration between March 1 and April 21, 2020. In addition to the above CPT codes, we identified intubation according to ICD-10 procedure codes for insertion of endotracheal airway, and respiratory ventilation, which were usually concordant. We cross-validated with medications typically used during intubation, such as neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., succinylcholine, rocuronium) and short acting sedatives (e.g., propofol, midazolam).

The efficacy of the BCG is supposed to wane over time and so the most of the protective effects of BCG in aged people, is any, is supposed to be mediated largely by herd immunity. Herd immunity would occlude the discontinuity.</p><p>2. BCG is a weakened version of tuberculosis (TB) and TB infection would exert equivalent or even stronger protective effects with the BCG hypothesis. Before implementation of BCG policy, most of the countries were high tuberculosis burden countries. So aged people in those countries are expected to be protected by their experience of TB infection in a similar way BCG protects, under the BCG hypothesis.

It is a retrospective survey so it means “after the fact.”  This kind of study is<br>useful when done properly, but there is a danger of the researcher introducing<br>bias since they know the end result of the patients before they start the study. The researcher is pulling data from a database.  The ability to include data that supports your hypothesis and exclude data that does NOT support your hypothesis is always a temptation.<br>2.    The study does NOT show that hydroxychloroquine is more harmful.  In simple terms, the study could only prove one of two options as posed by the following questions; “Is hydroxychloroquine better than nothing?” or “Is hydroxychloroquine NOT better than nothing?”  There is nothing about this research design that can or could ever prove, Is hydroxychloroquine WORSE than nothing (cause harm)?”<br>3.    The survey includes patients that did not start hydroxychloroquine or<br>hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin until after they were already on a<br>ventilator.  Since ventilator use was an outcome measured, were these patients counted as needing a ventilator?  These patients should not have been included<br>in the study.<br>4. The control group was defined as a patient that did NOT receive hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin. So you would assume that the 158 patients included in this group did not receive any kind of treatment, right; WRONG! 50 of these patients received azithromycin alone, 19 patients received an ACE inhibitor, and 16 patients received an ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker).  The ACE and ARB are blood pressure medications being looked at as therapies since they affect the receptor in the lung cells that COVID-19 attacks.  So, 85 out of 158 patients, over half,received other treatments without hydroxychloroquine, yet each one of these treatments are not accounted for in how any one of them could impact the results of the study.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920";"2020-04-25";"21:40:43";"2020-04-25T21:40:43";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2";"2020.04.16.20065920"

They used CPT codes 31500, 94002, 94003, and E0463 and ICD-10 procedure codes indicative of assistance with respiratory ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We identified 5,906 COVID-19 patients treated in the Veterans Health Administration between March 1 and April 21, 2020. In addition to the above CPT codes, we identified intubation according to ICD-10 procedure codes for insertion of endotracheal airway, and respiratory ventilation, which were usually concordant. We cross-validated with medications typically used during intubation, such as neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., succinylcholine, rocuronium) and short acting sedatives (e.g., propofol, midazolam). We also found these intubation codes most frequently in the context of intensive care. We did not find similar evidence of face validity for ventilation assistance codes.

This is probably inflating the numbers of COVID deaths we are seeing, but it seems the public health officials believe it to be better to err on the side of inflated numbers, so as avoid underestimating he lethality of the virus. So, if a  greater percentage of people  test positive than we originally thought, we have been inflating the numerator and underestimating the denominator and that would mean we are grossly overestimating the case fatality rate.

Seropositivity and clinical symptoms (questionnaires) were assessed. No RT-PCR data are provided about the presence or absence of SARS-CoV2. <br>To note that among the 878 individuals first invited, only 326 (37%) agreed to participate. Further, the sample was completed by 345 individuals. This recruitment history cannot exclude selection bias e.g. smokers or former smokers were more likely to decline participation than nonsmokers.<br>Of the 661 participants 452 (68,4%) reported respiratory symptoms and could be considered as having COVID-19. Among the 661 participants only 171  had anti-SARS-CoV2 seropositivity (25.9 %).The discriminative ability of the serological determination seems to be weak  with respect of the clinical symptoms in particular between no symptoms and minor symptoms according to Suppl. Table 1:  No symptoms: 13.9%; Minor symptoms: 16%, Major symptoms 37.7 % (but Minor symptoms: 26% according to Table 2. <br>The reported smoking rate is 10.4 % (69/661). Out of the 661 individuals tested, among nonsmokers 167 (25.7%) and among the smokers 5/69 (7.2%) were tested serologically positive. No definition of “smokers”, no data about former smokers, no biochemical verification of smoking status are provided. It cannot be excluded that there were some occasional smokers, recent or long-term quitters in the nonsmoker group. <br>Page 8 last paragraph: “Smoking was found to be associated with lower risk of infection ”after adjustment for age and occupation. No adjustment for gender was done, however the sample’s consists of largely more women  than men  (women: 62% men : 38%,) which is the opposite in the general population in France. The authors use “infection” for seropositivity all over the manuscript. However, infection can be implied if SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR is positive. The fact that 452 reported clinical symptoms of infection and only 25.9 % were seropositive leads to the question  what are the factors contributing to seroconversion i.e. having a good immune response to SARS-CoV2. This is not explored in the paper (no SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR). A proxy answer to this question would be to provide detailed clinical and demographic information in Suppl Table 1, not only serological information. More specifically, what is the distribution of smokers and nonsmokers according to the clinical features and serological findings.<br>Because of the low seropositive rates (25.9%) and lack of direct SARS-COV2 detection one cannot conclude about factors contributing to the seroconversion. One can hypothesize that the higher seropositive rate among nonsmokers can be due, among other factors, to the higher percent of women. <br>In this sample the percent of women is higher than that of men  contrary to other reports of individuals with COVID-19. In large samples, men  have  higher smoking rate than women and more men  have COVID-19 than women. More than one third of the sample is ≤17 years old; the smoking prevalence in this group is usually very low. It is likely that the nonsmokers with seroconversion are mainly women. One can hypothesize that smokers have a lower seroconversion rate that non-smokers explaining the lower percent of smokers with seropositivity.<br>The observed lower anti-SARS-CoV2 seropositivity rate among smokers in this sample is an interesting unexpected but secondary finding. Before  drawing any conclusion about this finding and generalize them,  further studies are needed aiming to assess specifically the incidence of COVID-19,  SARS-CoV2 infection and anti-SARS-CoV2 seropositivity  among well documented smokers, correctly classified former smokers versus lifelong never smokers.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134";"2020-04-25";"14:55:25";"2020-04-25T14:55:25";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071134v1";"2020.04.18.20071134"

The problem lies in the fact that once people went on ventilators they where given HC or HC+AZ. This re-categorised the patients by increasing the number of high risk patients in the HC and HC+AZ groups making the No HC an invalid control group.</p><p>Before ventilation the statistics was like this: (Table 4 in paper)</p><p><code>   HC:  90 -  9 (10.0%) deaths -  69 (76.6%) recover - 12 (13.3%) onto ventilation<br>HC+AZ: 101 - 11 (10.9%) deaths -  83 (82.2%) recover -  7 (06.9%) onto ventilation<br>No HC: 177 - 15 ( 8.4%) deaths - 137 (77.4%) recover - 25 (14.1%) onto ventilation</code></p><p>We see that death-rate is about the same for all groups but HC+AZ seams to have the highest recovery rate but it might not be statistically significant.</p><p>Now once people hit ventilation the re-categorisation occurs. More patients where given HC and HC+AZ which moved them from the No HC group to the HC or HC+AZ group. These groups therefore have a much higher % of ventilation patients because they where given the drugs after they hit ventilation.</p><p>The following data can be derived from the paper but is not presented:<br>Once people hit ventilation we have the following results.</p><p><code>   HC: 19 - 18 (95%) deaths - 1 (11%) recover<br>HC+AZ: 19 - 14 (73%) deaths - 5 (27%) recover<br>No HC:  6 -  3 (50%) deaths - 3 (50%) recover</code></p><p>If you compare these 2 tables, you see that 25 patient with No HC reach ventilation. Once they reach ventilation, 19 of these where give HC or HC+AZ, thereby moved from the No HC group to the other two. 79.5% of all patients reaching ventilation died so arguably 14 patients that died where moved from the No HC group to the other 2 groups only once they reach the much higher risk state.</p><p>Here are the number of people per group that got ventilation:</p><p><code>   HC:  97 - 19 (19.6%) got ventilation<br>HC+AZ: 113 - 19 (16.8%) got ventilation<br>No HC: 158 -  6 ( 3.4%) got ventilation</code></p><p>So the conclusion that HC causes more death is basically wrong.

"2971";"4887855224";"disqus_PzN6avqkmL";"Philip Davies";"<p>Well, well well,</p><p>This pre-print would make a good script for an episode of Columbo.</p><p>The retrospective analysis, as presented, leads the reader to just one conclusion in a bazaar of many possible conclusions.</p><p>I am even starting to have sympathy with D. Raoult and his team. I note his hot tempered response to this paper, where he lists two enormous factors that should be considered when wrestling with the data: the fact that the HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts were a sicker crowd (he lists lymphopenia) and that the sickest of the non-HCQ ventilated patients were then given HCQ (plus AZ in most cases) in a desperate last bid only for most to die.</p><p>Raoult's point is certainly valid.</p><p>We must remember that for most of the study period the use of HCQ was ""ex-license"" on a compassionate basis only. This means only the sickest patients got it. Remember also that this is a retrospective analysis, therefore observational. It was not run as a therapeutic trial. On the other hand, the use of AZ was already accepted (hence 30% of the non-HCQ cohort got it anyway).... although do be aware that by this time there had been quite a lot of focus on potentially dangerous QT lengthening when HCQ and AZ were used together in very sick patients.</p><p>The HCQ cohort was, across all key determinants, the weakest and sickest group (it had the poorest prospects looking at age, ethnicity, smoking status, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease (strokes),dementia, COPD, Diabetes (with and without complications)! ... and indeed, the HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts did have 100% more lymphopenia than the non-HCQ group.</p><p>BUT, the big asymmetric issues become obvious when we look at the pre- and post- ventilator numbers.</p><p>In terms of patients discharged without needing ventilation, the ""victorious"" non-HCQ group performs poorer than the 2 treated groups. This despite having a better prognostic baseline. But the results for this group change dramatically (for the better) when we look at the outcomes of ventilation. 25 ventilated patients came from this group.... but 19 of these 25 patients were then started on HCQ or HCQ &amp; AZ after ventilation was started. It is screamingly obvious that these would be the sickest patients in that group: they were given such compassionate drugs in extremis. So having ejected 19 of 25 ventilated patients into the other cohorts, the non-HCQ group only had 3 deaths from its remaining 6 ventilated patients.</p><p>The numbers of ventilated patients in the other cohorts (HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ) were thus substantially inflated with these new super-sick patients, who mostly died.</p><p>There really can be no conclusion at all when looking at a study of this nature without knowing much more about individual clinical conditions and guiding principles behind clinician's decision making. It's still possible to make some reasonable assumptions:</p><p>If I were Columbo?... I would say the non-HCQ cohort contained patients of extremes, with the best and worst potential. The worst would have been the very frail (malignancy and or congestive heart failure maybe ... see the stats), who probably were earmarked for 'supplemental oxygen' only from the very start. Such patients would not have been suitable for compassionate use of non proven drugs (remember, most of this came before the ""emergency use"" edict by FDA). This would explain the number of non-ventilated patients who died in this group (they may have been given AZ only, not being a controversial drug, but otherwise they did not get any significant interventional therapy). These patients would have had significant chronic disease and very poor obs/indices (including lymphopenia). But given that this cohort had, overall, a better starting prognosis than the other two groups, it means that the remaining patients in the group were promising candidates for survival (with better obs/indices). Such patients, not being part of a clinical trial, would not have been offered HCQ on a compassionate basis unless they got dramatically worse .... and of course, the ones who did get worse on the ventilator were started on HCQ (&amp; often AZ as well) and thus swapped into the HCQ / HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts.</p><p>If we can understand that, then we might start to think that in fact HCQ &amp; AZ is the best performing cohort with the other 2 vaguely distant. But this is being unfair to the HCQ cohort:</p><p>The reason that a sick patient would be given one experimental drug on a compassionate basis (HCQ) but not have a rather less experimental drug further added (AZ), can really only be explained by considering risk versus benefit. A clinician would choose to use HCQ because the patient was particularly sick. The clinician would only add AZ if it was felt that this was worth the risk.... but a particularly sick patient with significant cardiovascular disease (the HCQ contained the most CVD risk) might then die of a more abrupt arrhythmia through adding yet another QT lengthening drug. I dare say the clinicians were tempted to make some ""Hail Mary"" plays, but we must remember, these patients were not part of an ongoing trial, these drugs were ""ex-license"" for compassionate use only and clinicians were still accountable for responsible actions. So for those particularly sick frail patients, it wasn't worth the risk.</p><p>I am pretty sure that the HCQ cohort (which had pretty good pre-ventilator stats) crashed badly because it was loaded with the sickest patients .... patients that were too sick to risk adding AZ.</p><p>So, the findings of this retrospective analysis are, in my opinion, likely to be incorrect.</p><p>I believe I can confidently state that:</p><p>1. The HCQ cohort started with the sickest patients and had even more of the sickest added during ventilation. Some were too sick to risk the addition of AZ to existing HCQ.<br>2. The HCQ/AZ cohort also had some very sick patients (again with more additions during ventilation).<br>3. The Non-HCQ cohort had the best prognosis overall from the very start (although likely a polarized mixture of the most frail and the most promising)... and then its stats got even better when it jettisoned its sickest ventilated patients into the other 2 cohorts.</p><p>It is almost impossible to reach a conclusion from all this. BUT, the most likely finding is NOT that adding HCQ delivers a worse outcome than standard treatment. In fact, if we look at the pre-ventilator stats, the addition of HCQ might actually have provided considerable benefit to a particularly sick group of patients. Whether or not the addition of AZ to HCQ adds benefit is also unclear ... although my 'swingometer' is pointing slightly more to benefit than harm.</p><p>Once again. I suggest that a robust study into prophylaxis and early treatment (using sensible safer doses adjusted for pulmonary sequestration) will deliver the most interesting results for CQ/HCQ.</p><p>Dr Phil Davies<br>Aldershot Centre For Health<br><a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevirus.uk%3AhtEXUvGB9oUtElJ5qloZMzFsgdk&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""http://thevirus.uk"">http://thevirus.uk</a></p><p>EditView in discussion<br>Discussion on medrxiv  3 comments<br>medrxiv viewer<br>Philip Davies<br>Philip Davies  4 days ago<br>The low dose arm of this study is worth following.</p><p>The big problem for this study is comparison. It really has not defined the control population at all. The Italian and Chinese references are entirely different. Even the 2 Chinese populations referenced had massively different outcomes because the populations examined were different.</p><p>The Italian mortality rate was actually similar to the overall study average here (but much higher than the low dose arm). The Chinese study involved all patients admitted to the two hospitals ... that included a majority of patients with moderate (""ordinary"" as the Chinese class it) disease severity. The patients in this Brazilian study were regarded as severe or critical ... such patients (looking at worldwide stats) would attract a mortality of 30-40% plus.</p><p>This is the most important factor. Do not compare apples with pears. So far this study points the ""swingometer"" in favor of benefit versus harm for the use of HQN in patients with advanced disease.</p><p>Once again however, we are looking at the potential impact of an orally administered drug to patients with advanced disease. That's a big ask.</p><p>For CQ and HCQ the most interesting results will likely come from studies looking at prophylaxis and early treatment (using safe doses, not silly high doses with added drugs that also lengthen QT). We can't yet guess how they will pan out.</p><p>Dr Philip Davies<br>GP<br>Aldershot Centre For Health, UK<br><a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevirus.uk%3AhtEXUvGB9oUtElJ5qloZMzFsgdk&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""http://thevirus.uk"">http://thevirus.uk</a></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920";"2020-04-24";"09:57:00";"2020-04-24T09:57:00";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2";"2020.04.16.20065920"

Time being of the essence, it is therefore essential to explore drugs already on the market for other indications. These drugs, however, must be tested in COVID-19 patients and thus selection of limited candidates is important. The authors argue that an important step in accelerating the selection of promising drugs can be done in silico.<br>The authors use machine learning (ML), training their algorithm on a dataset obtained from  in vitro targeting of SARS Coronavirus 3C-like Protease with existing drugs. The trained algorithm was then used to screen drugs available in the Food and Drug Administration’s Drug Bank. Using the Drug Bank dataset, the authors also performed a docking study -a process used to predict in silico the orientation and conformation of a molecule when bound to its receptor. Since SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is considered to play an important role in infection by binding ACE-2, docking was also applied to study the stability of drug-spike protein complexes. The results of the ML and docking were aligned, and antiretroviral Saquinavir was identified as a potentially promising therapy for COVID-19.</p><p>Limitations<br>The authors train their algorithm on SARS Coronavirus 3C-like Protease, as inhibitors of this protein should prevent the virus from replicating in the host. However, the authors note that the most promising target seems to be SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moreover, the training dataset is the result of in vitro studies, and may have limited relevance in vivo.<br>Overall, preclinical studies and then potential clinical trials would need to be performed before administering this drug to COVID-19 patients though, admittedly, clinical validation of an existing drug could happen faster than the development of new drugs entirely.  Saquinavir has been studied in vitro by Yamamoto et al.[1], and shown little promise in SARS-CoV-2 treatment so far.</p><p>Significance<br>Repurposing of existing drugs is can be advantageous to develop treatment strategies. An in silico approach could help identify potential therapies, although they must be confirmed in clinical trials before being administered on a large scale.</p><p>References<br>Yamamoto et al.

All studies I mentioned have one thing in common and that's looking into sample of people who are not counted among the ""official"" COVID-19 cases and are not considered high risk either and try to see how many are seropositive, so that we can get an idea of the prevalence of seropositives in general population. The % of positive cases will vary depending on the stage of the pandemic - earlier stage in CA and hence higher ratio of positives to diagnosed cases, vs. later stage in NY hence lower ratio. Btw I'm sure by now you've heard about the NY survey of 3000, suggesting a 10:1 ratio of infected to diagnosed cases (expected and not contradictory to this study, as they are far more closer to the peak of the pandemic, hence more testing and more diagnosis).

Why was that?  What does that suggest?<br><b>8.</b> Although they were statistically insignificant, what was the result of the 17 women not included in the study?<br><b>9.</b> Why does the paper seem to address political points? It seems like the Abstract is editorialized, which I'm not used to. The result seems to address topical issues of the times, having awareness of other similar studies being conducted, rather than a standalone independent study of its own. I interpret this as potential for some analysis/deciphering bias. I don't mind in the Discussion sentence as it's normal, I'm just not as accustomed to seeing it in the Abstract.</p><p><b>New List of Observations</b></p><p><b>1.</b> There seems to be some bias in the number of healthy people with no-HC treatment, but left in the study.  Those people are going to be unlikely to die to begin with.  This is not a comparison of apples to apples.  </p><p>To clarify:<br> - Dramatic difference in percentage of people people that had fever temperatures (38.1-39.0ºC / 100.58-102.2ºF); HC:11.3%, HC+AZ:11.5%, no-HC:7.6%.  There’s ~4% difference between treated and untreated fever temps (more likely to die) in favor of untreated cohort.  <br>- Compare that with the percentage of people that had normal temperatures (35-37ºC/95-98.6ºF);HC:56.7%, HC+AZ:52.2%, no-HC:61.4%.  There’s a 5-9% difference between treated and untreated normal temps (likely to not die) in favor of untreated cohort.</p><p>  So in this study, there was a larger proportion of people that did not have fevers, suggesting the data may be padded.  In absolute numbers it's approx. a 40 person swing, which is a fairly large percentage in such a small study/survey. Similar observations are for systolic blood pressure and breaths per minute.  There appears to be more healthy people  again.</p><p><b>2.</b> Creatinine is created when muscles breakdown creatine.  It’s a waste product removed by the kidneys.  Levels are elevated when the kidneys begin to fail.  Notice, there’s a much larger presence in the HC-groups, which suggests there was a larger percentage of these patients experiencing kidney failure. </p><p><b>3.</b> There are an awful lot of missing data in solely the no-HC group for statistically significant criteria.  For instance Erythrocytes (red blood cells that transport oxygen), there 11.4% (!) missing in no-HC patients, yet that category has a P-value of 0.001 (&lt;0.05 is statistically significant).  </p><p>Hermatocrit is the same way (missing 11.4% for no-HC).  It’s also related to red blood cells, it is the ratio of red blood cells to the blood volume.  Same missing amount for Leukocytes (white blood cells) test.  And also Lymphocytes —white blood cells in lymphatic system, which transports fatty acids from the digestive system and white blood cells from the lymph nodes into the bones— not only has a lot of missing data, but the disproportional low count (&lt;800 per mm^3) may warrant further investigation.</p><p><b>4.</b> Even looking at the statistically significant Cerebrovascular disease, there are a much larger percentage of HC-only patients per its cohort. </p><p><b>5.</b> Table 4 describes a greater percentage of people using HC+AZ being discharged (recovering) w/o ventilation; 5% more than no-HC patients.  Keep in mind that 30% of the no-HC patients were given AZ.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920";"2020-04-24";"01:46:41";"2020-04-24T01:46:41";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2";"2020.04.16.20065920"

Raoult and his team. I note his hot tempered response to this paper, where he lists two enormous factors that should be considered when wrestling with the data: the fact that the HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts were a sicker crowd (he lists lymphopenia) and that the sickest of the non-HCQ ventilated patients were then given HCQ (plus AZ in most cases) in a desperate last bid only for most to die.</p><p>Raoult's point is certainly valid.</p><p>We must remember that for most of the study period the use of HCQ was ""ex-license"" on a compassionate basis only. This means only the sickest patients got it. Remember also that this is a retrospective analysis, therefore observational. It was not run as a therapeutic trial. On the other hand, the use of AZ was already accepted (hence 30% of the non-HCQ cohort got it anyway).... although do be aware that by this time there had been quite a lot of focus on potentially dangerous QT lengthening when HCQ and AZ were used together in very sick patients.</p><p>The HCQ cohort was, across all key determinants, the weakest and sickest group (it had the poorest prospects looking at age, ethnicity, smoking status, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease (strokes),dementia, COPD, Diabetes (with and without complications)! ... and indeed, the HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts did have 100% more lymphopenia than the non-HCQ group.</p><p>BUT, the big asymmetric issues become obvious when we look at the pre- and post- ventilator numbers.</p><p>In terms of patients discharged without needing ventilation, the ""victorious"" non-HCQ group performs poorer than the 2 treated groups. This despite having a better prognostic baseline. But the results for this group change dramatically (for the better) when we look at the outcomes of ventilation. 25 ventilated patients came from this group.... but 19 of these 25 patients were then started on HCQ or HCQ &amp; AZ after ventilation was started.  It is screamingly obvious that these would be the sickest patients in that group: they were given such compassionate drugs in extremis.  So having ejected 19 of 25 ventilated patients into the other cohorts, the non-HCQ group only had 3 deaths from its remaining 6 ventilated patients.</p><p>The numbers of ventilated patients in the other cohorts (HCQ and HCQ &amp; AZ) were thus substantially inflated with these new super-sick patients, who mostly died.</p><p>There really can be no conclusion at all when looking at a study of this nature without knowing much more about individual clinical conditions and guiding principles behind clinician's decision making. It's still possible to make some reasonable assumptions:</p><p>If I were Columbo?... I would say the non-HCQ cohort contained patients of extremes, with the best and worst potential. The worst would have been the very frail (malignancy and or congestive heart failure maybe ... see the stats), who probably were earmarked for 'supplemental oxygen' only from the very start. Such patients would not have been suitable for compassionate use of non proven drugs (remember, most of this came before the ""emergency use"" edict by FDA). This would explain the number of non-ventilated patients who died in this group (they may have been given AZ only, not being a controversial drug, but otherwise they did not get any significant interventional therapy). These patients would have had significant chronic disease and very poor obs/indices (including lymphopenia). But given that this cohort had, overall, a better starting prognosis than the other two groups, it means that the remaining patients in the group were promising candidates for survival (with better obs/indices). Such patients, not being part of a clinical trial, would not have been offered HCQ on a compassionate basis unless they got dramatically worse .... and of course, the ones who did get worse on the ventilator were started on HCQ (&amp; often AZ as well) and thus swapped into the HCQ / HCQ &amp; AZ cohorts.</p><p>If we can understand that, then we might start to think that in fact HCQ &amp; AZ is the best performing cohort with the other 2 vaguely distant. But this is being unfair to the HCQ cohort:</p><p>The reason that a sick patient would be given one experimental drug on a compassionate basis (HCQ) but not have a rather less experimental drug further added (AZ), can really only be explained by considering risk versus benefit. A clinician would choose to use HCQ because the patient was particularly sick. The clinician would only add AZ if it was felt that this was worth the risk.... but a particularly sick patient with significant cardiovascular disease (the HCQ contained the most CVD risk) might then die of a more abrupt arrhythmia through adding yet another QT lengthening drug. I dare say the clinicians were tempted to make some ""Hail Mary"" plays, but we must remember, these patients were not part of an ongoing trial, these drugs were ""ex-license"" for compassionate use only and clinicians were still accountable for responsible actions. So for those particularly sick frail patients, it wasn't worth the risk.</p><p>I am pretty sure that the HCQ cohort (which had pretty good pre-ventilator stats) crashed badly because it was loaded with the sickest patients .... patients that were too sick to risk adding AZ.</p><p>So, the findings of this retrospective analysis are, in my opinion, likely to be incorrect.</p><p>I believe I can confidently state that:</p><p>1. The HCQ cohort started with the sickest patients and had even more of the sickest added during ventilation. Some were too sick to risk the addition of AZ to existing HCQ.<br>2. The HCQ/AZ cohort also had some very sick patients (again with more additions during ventilation). <br>3. The Non-HCQ cohort had the best prognosis overall from the very start (although likely a polarized mixture of the most frail and the most promising)... and then its stats got even better when it jettisoned its sickest ventilated patients into the other 2 cohorts.</p><p>It is almost impossible to reach a conclusion from all this. BUT, the most likely finding is NOT that adding HCQ delivers a worse outcome than standard treatment. In fact, if we look at the pre-ventilator stats, the addition of HCQ might actually have provided considerable benefit to a particularly sick group of patients. Whether or not the addition of AZ to HCQ adds benefit is also unclear ... although my 'swingometer' is pointing slightly more to benefit than harm.</p><p>Once again. I suggest that a robust study into prophylaxis and early treatment (using sensible safer doses adjusted for pulmonary sequestration) will deliver the most interesting results for CQ/HCQ.</p><p>Dr Phil Davies<br>Aldershot Centre For Health<br><a href=""http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthevirus.uk%3AhtEXUvGB9oUtElJ5qloZMzFsgdk&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""http://thevirus.uk"">http://thevirus.uk</a></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920";"2020-04-24";"00:57:17";"2020-04-24T00:57:17";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v1";"2020.04.16.20065920"

Performing in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with two sets of overlapping SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools – the S I pool spanning the N-terminal region (aa 1-643) of the S protein, including 21 predicted SARS-CoV-1 MHC-II epitopes, and the C-terminal S II pool (aa 633-1273) containing 13 predicted SARS-CoV-1 MHC-II epitopes – the authors detected S-protein-specific CD4 T cells in up to 83% of COVID-19 patients based on intracellular 4-1BB (CD137) and CD40L (CD154) induction. Notably, peptide pool S II shares higher homology with human endemic coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 that may cause the common cold, but it does not include the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), which has been identified as a critical target of neutralizing antibodies in both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. S I-reactive CD4 T cells were found in 12 out of 18 (67%) patients, whereas CD4 T cells against S II were detected in 15 patients (83%). Intriguingly, S-specific CD4 T cells could also be found in 34% (n=23) of 68 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative donors, referred to as reactive healthy donors (RHD), with a preference for S II over S I epitopes. Only 6 of 23 RHDs also had detectable frequencies of S I-specific CD4 T cells, overall suggesting S II-reactive CD4 T cells had likely developed in response to prior infections with hCoVs. Of 18 out of 68 total healthy donors tested, all were found to have anti-hCoV antibodies, although this was independent of concomitant anti-S II CD4 T cell frequencies detected. This finding mirrors observations of declining numbers of specific CD4 T cells, but persistent humoral memory after certain vaccinations such as against yellow fever. The authors further speculate that these pre-existing virus-specific T cells against hCoVs might be one of the reasons why children and younger patients, usually considered to have a higher incidence of hCoV infections per year, are seemingly better protected against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike specific CD4 T cells found in RHDs, most S-specific CD4 T cells in COVID-19 patients displayed a phenotype of recent <i>in vivo</i> activation with co-expression of HLA-DR and CD38, as well as variable expression of Ki-67. In addition, a substantial fraction of peripherally found HLA-DR+/CD38+ bulk CD4 T cells was found to be refractory to peptide stimulation, potentially indicating cellular exhaustion.</p><p><b><i>Limitations </i></b></p><p>This is one of the first preprints reporting the detection of virus-specific CD4 T cells in COVID-19 (also cf.

While it generally adds to our current knowledge about the potential role of T cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, a few limitations, some of which are discussed by the authors themselves, should be addressed. Findings in this study pertain to a relatively small cohort of patients of variable clinical disease. To corroborate the observations made here, larger studies including both more healthy donors and more patients of all clinical stages are needed to better assess the function of virus-specific CD4 T cells in COVID-19. Specifically, the presence of pre-existing, potentially hCoV-cross-reactive CD4 T cells in healthy donors needs to be explored in the context of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. While the authors suggest a potentially protective role based on higher incidence of hCoV infection in children and younger patients, and therefore a presumably larger pool of pre-existing virus-specific memory T cells, the opposite could also be the case given cumulatively increased number of hCoV infections in older patients. In this context, it would therefore have been interesting to also measure anti-hCoV antibodies in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, this study did not quantify virus-specific CD8 T cells. Based on observations in SARS-CoV-1, virus-specific memory CD8 T cells are more likely to persist long-term and confer protection than CD4 T cells, which were detected only at lower frequencies six years post recovery from SARS-CoV-1 (cf. Li CK et al., Journal of immunology 181, 5490-5500.) Morover, no other specifities such as against the N or M epitopes were evaluated. Robust generation of virus-specific T cells against the N protein was shown to be induced by SARS-CoV-2 in another pre-print by Dong et al. (Dong et al., <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.03.17.20036640v1%29%3Ak6Vt_vEMGLbRqxBfoBOBC4anWaQ&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20036640v1)"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a>, while Weiskopf et al. recently reported  preference of both CD8 and CD4 T cells for S epitopes <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.04.11.20062349v1.article-info%29%3AEdRJavEktp0crSYbqAXIms3dpPY&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.11.20062349v1.article-info)"">https://www.medrxiv.org/con...</a>. Moreover, the authors seem to suggest that some of the virus-specific CD4 T cells detected could be potentially cross-reactive to predicted SARS-CoV-1 epitopes present in the peptide pools used. Indeed, this has been recently established for several SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, while it was found not to be the case for RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies (cf.

A similar observation has not been made for T cells so far and should be evaluated. Finally, since reactive healthy donors were only tested for anti-S1 IgG, however not for other more ubiquitous binding antibodies, e.g. against M, and only a fraction of these donors was additionally confirmed to be negative by PCR, there is, though unlikely, the possibility that some of the seronegative reactive donors had been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p><i><b>Significance</b></i></p><p>Quantification of virus-specific T cells in peripheral blood is a useful tool to determine the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 both in acute disease and even more so post recovery. Ideally, once immunogenic T cell epitopes are better characterized, tetramer assays will allow for faster and more efficient detection of their frequencies. Moreover, assessing the potential role of pre-existing virus-specific CD4 T cells in healthy donors in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis will be of particular importance. The observations made here are also highly relevant for the design and development of potential vaccines and should therefore be further explored in ongoing research on potential coronavirus therapies and prevention strategies.</p><p><i>This review was undertaken by V. van der Heide as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn school of medicine, Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440";"2020-04-23";"17:27:44";"2020-04-23T17:27:44";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440v1";"2020.04.17.20061440"

Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p &lt; 10-2) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one were PCR-cleared at day 15. <br><br>A poor clinical outcome was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old). <br><br>Mortality was lower than in patients treated with other regimens in all Marseille public hospitals (p&lt; 10-2). Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). Poor clinical outcome was associated to older age (OR 1.11), initial higher severity (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. Poor clinical and virological outcomes were associated to the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (P&lt;0.05).

The authors hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 activates the complement cascade in severely ill patients through viral N-protein-mediated dimerization and activating auto-cleavage of MASP-2 leading to respiratory failure in some patients.</p><p>Following confirmation of MASP-2 binding to the N protein of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, the authors show that MASP-2/MBL binding is enhanced and subsequently demonstrate enhanced complement activation in vitro as measured by C4b deposition in a complement deposition assay and enhanced phagocyte activity. Translating these findings into an in vivo model, the authors pre-infected mice with an adenovirus expressing SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and control virus and challenged the animals with LPS to activate the lectin pathway. This effect was abolished when the N-protein was truncated or anti-MASP-2 antibodies or C1 esterase inhibitor (dissociates MASP from MBL) were used. In mice infected with SARS- or MERS-CoV, the authors found significantly higher C4b and C4 deposits in the lungs and showed tremendously worse survival. However, when MASP-2 knockout mice were challenged with the above-mentioned viruses (or C1 esterase inhibitor given), survival was substantially better as compared to virus-infected wildtype mice.</p><p>The authors next analyzed lung tissues from deceased COVID-19 patients and found strong IHC stainings of complement components. In the final step, the authors treated two critically ill COVID-19 patients with a monoclonal antibody that binds C5a (differs from the C5 convertase inhibitor eculizumab) as a part of a clinical trial. Both patients showed clinical improvement of their severe pneumoniae.</p><p><b>Limitations</b><br>The question if and in how far coronaviruses are capable of activating the complement system has been controversial so far with conflicting data published.</p><p>However, the authors performed a thorough and convincing analysis with well-designed in vitro an in vivo experiments showing the ability of the nucleocapsid to enhance MBL initiated complement activation.</p><p>The authors performed key experiments using adenoviruses only containing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV-2. While the assumption that due to the high sequence homology in the N-protein-binding motif and the proven binding of the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein to MASP-2 strongly suggests that the N-protein in SARS-CoV-2 also plays a major role in complement activation in vivo remains to be proven.</p><p>MBL induced complement activation is likely to increase C3a and C3b formation as well as C5a and MAC complex deposition.  The finding that anti C5a has some clinical benefit is of interest but does not directly support the MBL mechanism shown here (C5a production could occur via alternative or classical pathway activation)</p><p><b>Significance</b><br>Anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with severe viral pneumonia is established as a clinical standard procedure. However, most pathophysiologic aspects of immune hyperreactivity in these patients remains unclear. The study reviewed here shows one mechanism by which coronaviruses activate the complement cascade causing or at least aggravating inflammation in the lung. Showing the successful treatment of two patients with a anti-C5a mAb (not available in the US) is promising and supportive of ongoing or planned trials of a cyclic peptide C3 inhibitor or a C5 convertase inhibiting monoclonal antibody (eculizumab) in severely ill COVID-19 patients.</p><p><i>Reviewed by C.

From a list of 60 countries in descending order by number of confirmed cases, 16 countries were selected for inclusion into either the high CQ/HCQ production or use group, versus not. Countries were included if they met the criteria for having data from the day of the 3rd death in the entire country and the daily deaths for the 10 days immediately following, until both groups were populated with a list of 16 (Figure 1: Table with the CQ/HCQ group list; Figure 2: Table with the “control” group list). For each group of countries, the average daily deaths were determined, and the curves projected to illustrate trajectories. In Figure 3, the author suggests that the deaths in the countries belonging to the control group follow an exponential curve, while the progression of average daily deaths in the countries with greater use of CQ/HCQ follow a polynomial curve.</p><p>The author then applies Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), a modeling tool used for time-series forecasting (i.e., predicting the future trajectory of data over time using the data from previous time points as predictors in a linear regression). The Auto Regressive component refers to each difference between two previous time points that make the model “stationary” (current – previous); the Moving Average is the number of forecast errors from calculating these differences that should go in the model. The author uses ARIMA to predict the next 10 days of mean deaths for the CQ/HCQ list (Figure 6) and the control countries (Figure 8). In figures 9 and 10, autocorrelations of residuals are performed to determine internal validity of the model, here defined as no significant autocorrelations.<br>In conjunction, the author argues that these findings support major differences in death rates between countries that use/mass produce CQ/HCQ versus those that do not.</p><p><u><b>Limitations</b></u><br>The title of this study refers to itself as an ecological study, an observational study in which the data are defined at the population level, rather than individual. Although this study design allows for rapid hypothesis testing in large datasets, a robust ecological study should account for as many known risk-modifying factors or confounders as possible. Subsequently, any results should be reviewed under strict criteria for causality, since there is high probability of the outcomes falling under the definition of ecological fallacy, which occurs when inferences about individuals are determined from inferences about a group to which they belong.</p><p>This study conflated the use and mass production of CQ/HCQ at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in each respective country, with that country’s direct pandemic response. It is never explained whether use or production is the key output for any given country, which are vastly different metrics. The author fails to consider other reasons for having existing infrastructure for the mass production of drugs like hydroxychloroquine, whether the country was a global supplier of the medication (India), or is a region where malaria is endemic (India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea), which may correlate to both chloroquine production and use. Notably, the countries from which studies of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 have been predominantly performed (China, France, USA), are all in the control list of countries. Additionally, the data for cases and deaths were collected from reports accessed from <a href=""https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldometers.info%2Fcoronavirus%2F%3B%3A395LlBJbdA5QJLkGK2wpbq881og&amp;cuid=5391416"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" title=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/;"">https://www.worldometers.in...</a> data were not selected from the top countries using a methodological approach, but rather skipping certain countries to use only the most complete death data for the timeframe of interest, allowing for bias introduced by the reporting of each individual country.</p><p>With regards to the statistical methods applied, namely ARIMA, they are non-standard practices for interpreting the results of an ecological study. The first problem with this, in my opinion, is that the message will be difficult to interpret and criticize for many scientists, as ARIMA will be unfamiliar to most in the biological sciences. Further, the models applied (Table 4) do not take into account any confounders, which is a requirement for robust analysis of an ecological study. There are only 3 variables in this type of model: p, the autoregressive coefficient, q, the moving average coefficient, and d, the difference between points in the time-series. Any flaws or bias inherent to the input data are then upheld and propagated by the model, which does not allow for any other variable that would contribute to the risk of death.</p><p><u><b>Significance</b></u><br>The faults of the stratification of countries into the groups proposed in this study, together with the unorthodox application of ARIMA modeling, make it challenging to accept the conclusion that the author draws in this study. The apparent decrease in death rate in countries with a high production/use/either/or of CQ/HCQ could be due to any number of other factors for which this study did not account. The top 5 countries in both confirmed cases and reported deaths are all in the control list, which has no relationship to the amount of CQ/HCQ production within those countries yet skews the data to make the dynamics of death rate appear more dramatic.</p><p><i>Reviewed by Rachel Levantovsky as part of a project by students, postdocs and faculty at the Immunology Institute of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</i></p>";"10.1101/2020.04.18.20063875";"2020-04-28";"14:00:55";"2020-04-28T14:00:55";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.18.20063875v1";"2020.04.18.20063875"

People can get infected by TB throughout their life. It is likely that much higher percentage of those people, who are now approx 40 years old or above now, has experience of TB infection, probably approximately to the same extent as those in people in Vietnam, considering that Thailand has TB incidence similar to that in Vietnam. So, again, it is also unlikely that discontinuity can be detected in this country.</p><p>Let me add another thing I noticed. In Fig 1, the scale of Y-axis is quite different between countries. Higher number of cases per 1M pop in children in Czech, who are not vaccinated, can be seen, compared to other countries shown here.</p><p>Again, considering herd immunity, loss of BCG efficacy in aged people, and high TB prevalence in the population (especially in aged people ), it is extremely unlikely that discontinuity can be found in this design.<br>BCG efficacy and TB prevalence change over time and so in other words, time-varying country-specific heterogeneity cannot be controlled, while time-invariant country-specific heterogeneity might be controlled, in this design. <br>Thus, the study design itself is inappropriate from the first in testing the BCG/TB hypothesis.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.13.20064287";"2020-04-28";"13:34:08";"2020-04-28T13:34:08";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20064287v1";"2020.04.13.20064287"

"3411";"4892889884";"davesezthings";"DaveSezThings";"<p>The error the authors have made is a basic one in the propagation of uncertainty. We have a test kit which has some uncertainty regarding its performance, hence the confidence intervals on the specificity and sensitivity of the test. These confidence intervals are established by the manufacturer's trial using 85 confirmed positive and 371 confirmed negative samples and the author's tests on 37 RT-PCR-positive samples and 30 pre-COVID samples. Without further testing of the test kit using known samples there is nothing that can be done to change the confidence intervals for the sensitivity and specificity - it doesn't matter how many samples are tested for the main study. However, this is not correctly represented in the author's calculation of the propagation of the uncertainty by the author's. In their work they use the variances for the individual binomial distributions, compute the combined variance on this basis (called Var(pi) in the appendix) and then to get the standard error by taking the square-root of this combined variance divided by themain study sample size 3,330: SE(pi)=sqrt(Var(pi)/3330)=0.0034. This is incorrect. It confuses the variance of binomial distributions with the uncertainty regarding the estimate of parameters which will be binomially distributed. The author's should have been computing the square of the standard error using the delta method and replace each of the terms Var(q), Var(r) and Var(s) with their respective standard errors-squared (which will bring in some different n's for the various studies, although it'll be a bit more complicated for Var(r) and Var(s) given that more than one study has been combined to get these). This will give a much larger standard error for pi - the test-kit corrected prevalence. Alternative/better methods than the delta-method will yield the same result and it's such a large change that it essentially reduces the study to an upper-limit estimate only... the lower limit goes down to zero (or very close to zero).</p><p>It seems there are many other concerns as well regarding the sampling <br>method and technical details of the serology but I'm not able to comment<br> on those. I'm actually an optical physicist so I just have an amateur interest in this but a basic mathematical error is a basic mathematical error and that's what they've done. It's that bad. Looking through the comments here the point has been made many times in one form or another. There are 17 authors on this - it should take less than a day for one of them to correct the results and re-write the conclusions. It's no longer an interesting outcome of course - but it's scientifically the right thing to do - the fact that things are hurried because of the pandemic excuses errors but not quick correction once these have been pointed out. And there is no debate on this one - I might not be articulating the argument as well as others can and of course there are better analysis techniques than the delta method - but as sure as 2+2 isn't 5 their standard error for these results isn't what the authors claim. It's a big whoops - I hope the author's go easy on whoever of them made the mistake as I can well understand the time pressures surrounding this work. The classy thing to do is for all of them to take collective responsibility, issue the correction and move on from there.</p>";"10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463";"2020-04-28";"09:36:54";"2020-04-28T09:36:54";"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1";"2020.04.14.20062463"

Likewise, ___ of the 12 patients reclassified form the 'No HC group' into the 'HC+AZ' group died.""<br>Based on a comparison of Tables 4 and 3, the first blank must be either 6 or 7 whereas the second blank must be between 7 and 12, inclusive.</p><p>If the groups are compared based on whether they were given the drug(s) PRIOR to ventilation or prior to discharge, the HC+AZ is better by either a 20% margin over the 'No HC' group or by a FACTOR of 6. <br>To wit, let's assume that all 12 of reclassified as HC+AZ died. That would mean that only 2 in the original HC+AZ group died. Since we have no idea when the HC+AZ drug was administered to those who died without ventilation, a fair comparison would show that HC+AZ, one might justifiably count only the 2/90 (2.2%) in that group (excluding deaths w/o vent.) as having had HC+AZ early enough in treatment. It would also mean that 3+(6 or 7) + 12 out of 162 (13.6%, also excluding deaths prior to ventilation) eventually died. <br>This would be a huge difference with HC+AZ coming out as a terrific alternative (factor of 6 better) if given early enough.

I think of it this way.... each sample has a bias and random error component.   Estimators (depending of data distribution) can attempt to average out the error with increased samples. That also sometimes makes bias observable in the data set and can be adjusted for. I work in position estimating that uses TDOA FDOA or interefermetric data.
